1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
So Francis goes out and he's doing a prayer to the archangels.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,840
It's the feast of the archangels.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,120
And he's doing this prayer on this mountain, okay, and this is in Italy in the 1200s.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:27,200
And what happens is a seraph, and the seraph comes down and it basically has beams or something

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,680
like light beams.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,960
So then he's hurt by this seraph, right?

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,120
He has some kind of telepathic communication with it too.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,280
And they go back to the monastery and they hide the wounds.

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,040
They don't want anyone else to see.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,820
But you can see the radiation stuff or the light beams or whatever you want to call them.

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,080
And this imparts upon him the wounds of Christ.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,400
Now we could talk about that because it appears that if this is a seraph, there's a tradition

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,800
of angel mysticism, of people being contacted by angels and angels imparting knowledge,

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,800
like the Jacob contact event.

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,920
And it looks to be very powerful.

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:21,280
And it looks to be very powerful.

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,000
The history of our earth is so different from what we can imagine.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,960
The Smithsonian, if they found out about a large skeleton somewhere, was to go get it.

19
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,760
I'm going to assume at least one person is right because if one person is right, it busts

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
the paradigm.

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,280
It all goes back to the fallen chariot.

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,560
And the problem with the modern day church, they have a very truncated view of the supernatural.

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,360
This backdrop that's just pregnant with all kinds of meaning associated with this Mount

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,880
Hermon event.

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,360
And this guy defects from the kingdom.

26
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,440
That's a big deal.

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,360
Welcome back to Blurry Creatures.

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,400
We're excited today.

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,160
We have Dr. Diana Pasulka in the studio, in the flesh here.

30
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,760
And we did an episode, I think it was in the hundreds, a long time ago.

31
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
It was 176.

32
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,240
I looked it up the other day because we were talking about, Avon, I was telling somebody,

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,160
I was telling Doug Van Doren, we had a conference recently and one of our guests was, I was

34
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,960
talking about you coming in and how it's been a crazy year or two for you.

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,480
Because we initially had you on, we were talking before, a good friend of the show, a friend

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,040
of mine, Matt Maher, who's a worship artist.

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
He's a Catholic guy.

38
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,320
He introduced me to American Cosmic and that's why I reached out initially to have you on

39
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,160
the show because it's very, it feels like few and far between that someone in the religious

40
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,680
space and you're a PhD of religious studies, you chair the religious studies department

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,560
at your university and that speaks and talks about, or even contextualizes the UFO phenomena

42
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,960
and you started that.

43
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,080
But here, as we were talking before, today, the actual day of recording here, we are,

44
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,000
the second session of the House Oversight Committee on UAPs is happening, actually right

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
now.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,120
And the last year has been wild, at least for Blurry Creatures as well, because this

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,560
has become a much more mainstream topic, at least discuss the mainstream.

48
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,320
You just recently were on Joe Rogan, which is incredible.

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,480
And I want to hear about how this last year has been for you.

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,520
These things are happening in the biggest forums in culture right now, are having discussions

51
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:45,200
around this and now our government is also, at least in show, having a discussion around

52
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
that.

53
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
What do you feel about that?

54
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Yeah.

55
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Okay.

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,000
So first, wow, congratulations on your own amazing stratospheric success to what a great

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
studio this is.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I love it.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,080
I remember when we had the first podcast talk and it was kind of, it was really new

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,240
for me because I'm an academic.

62
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,800
So I started to get a lot of people who wanted to talk to me and I couldn't talk to everyone,

63
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
right?

64
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,040
So there's so many, like every single day.

65
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,200
And so I'd basically just put them in a file and then kind of sometimes I just couldn't

66
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
get to them.

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,480
But Blurry Creatures, Mitch Hedberg, I knew that and I'm like, okay, this is, yeah, yeah,

68
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Blurry Creatures.

69
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,280
I'm like, I want to talk to these guys because they have a worldview here in their title.

70
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,800
And I asked you too, I said, is this the Mitch Hedberg thing?

71
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
And you're like, yeah, yeah.

72
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,200
And I said, I'm in, I'm in.

73
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,000
And since then, you guys have just gone huge.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,280
I just love everything that you're doing and you stayed true to the epistemology of it.

75
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,920
And I love the kind of, well, not the kind of, the euphology and Christianity at the

76
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,000
same time, because really that's what it's about.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,520
And I think that that's just really cool.

78
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,080
So happy to be here again.

79
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Yeah, thank you.

80
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,840
That's kind of what I want to talk to you about, because I think a lot of times, you

81
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,440
know, when you go on shows like this, you have to kind of start from the beginning and

82
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,760
you have to sort of speak to the skeptics and the Christian skeptics.

83
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,320
And we don't have to do that today because I think a lot of our listeners have been here

84
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,320
for the last four years and know that there's a lot of data and this is an ancient phenomena.

85
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,060
And also all the above is true when it comes to UFOs.

86
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,160
We don't have to sit here and go, well, it's just a government Psi-Op and the government's

87
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
just inflating it.

88
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
Yeah.

89
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
Part of it is that.

90
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,480
But also people have been experiencing these things for a long time, way before Hollywood

91
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,000
made it a cool, I guess, or interesting or put it onto the public scene.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,440
And so I think it'd be good to just kind of pick up where we left off and not have to

93
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,680
go through a whole hour of like, let's talk to the skeptics.

94
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,360
Because I know that a lot of people who were into the UFO space, you kind of have to start

95
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
there.

96
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Yeah, you do.

97
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,000
But I don't feel like on our show where we're at, they can go back and listen to some other

98
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,600
episodes and kind of catch up to where we are.

99
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,320
And we say that a lot on the show, D, all the above, you know, like when it comes to

100
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,240
anything from like Bigfoot to UFOs, there are stories that are outside of whatever paradigm

101
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,160
you have and you have to scratch your head and go, what is that?

102
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,280
So I'd love to see where you are now and talk about the ancient part of it and the present

103
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
as well.

104
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,600
So that's one thing I was looking forward to because we touched on it a bit because

105
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,720
you told us all the stuff we never knew about the Vatican, right?

106
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,600
That there was this entire space where they had a wall or a portion of the library is

107
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,840
dedicated to now with the UFO phenomena, right?

108
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,640
And this is because what I think a lot of people will say in our space and in the church

109
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,960
as well is that this is a very modern phenomena, like, oh, yeah, since Roswell and Hollywood

110
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,120
and I think these things all play into it.

111
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,360
What I like about your work in American Cosmic and now in Encounters is you say, no, this

112
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,280
isn't new.

113
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
This isn't a new thing.

114
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
In fact.

115
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Yeah.

116
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
When did you get to that, that opinion?

117
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
When did you start to think?

118
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Yeah.

119
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Well, it began.

120
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Well, obviously.

121
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,120
So remember in 2012 is when I started to look into this as something that was happening

122
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,560
because I was finished with a lot of archival work where I had encountered aerial phenomena

123
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,040
from European Catholics from 1200 to 1800, you know, so that's a long time ago and even

124
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
before that.

125
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Okay.

126
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,880
And I kept this log, but it didn't occur to me that this had anything to do with UFOs.

127
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,600
I just thought it was really strange.

128
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,040
I included one in my book on the Catholic doctrine of purgatory, a history of that.

129
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,760
And so what I did was I showed it to a friend of mine and he said, this looks like, you

130
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,520
know, UFOs, Steven Spielberg types of things.

131
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,720
And I thought he was wacko, really.

132
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,240
But I went to a UFO conference near my town and I talked to people.

133
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,360
And so I started to then rethink how I was looking at these events, what I now call angel

134
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,040
contact events from history.

135
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
And of course, Christianity has a lot of them, right?

136
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,080
So the whole Bible's filled with them, you know, and really we're kind of programmed.

137
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,320
And you believe those are like UFO contact?

138
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,960
So what I think is that whatever we want to call that, it's the same thing that we're

139
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,240
seeing now.

140
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:21,040
So that recognition happened to me probably in late 2012.

141
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,520
And why did it happen?

142
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,080
Because I had primary source material from the Catholic tradition, which is the Christian

143
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,440
tradition.

144
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,320
And this was the actual events where people were having contact events.

145
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,680
And I saw that what was happening didn't look like how they were being represented.

146
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,720
So they were being represented.

147
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,400
So if you go back to the Bible and actually read about the angel events like Jacob wrestling

148
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,800
with the angel and so forth, it's pretty intense.

149
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,440
Like you know, we're talking about a high stakes interaction here that scares people.

150
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,360
And with Jacob, he actually got a blessing.

151
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,360
He fought this thing all night and got a blessing from it the next day.

152
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,360
So I was like, I had to say that I actually was woken up to my own religion.

153
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,720
And I was a Christian before, but I became like a super believer after that.

154
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,080
I was like, okay, this stuff is more real than I actually thought.

155
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,400
Because we've been kind of lulled into not actually acknowledging that these are real

156
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,200
things and they're still with us and they're still around and people have these experiences.

157
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
So that's when I woke up.

158
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,840
Well, it's hard for us because we talked about exorcists and trying to get to the...

159
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,120
And I think if you have a highly focused, specialized field, sometimes you have a hard

160
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,680
time including all this other stuff.

161
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,520
And I think on our show, it's a one stop shop for anything weird and strange.

162
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,680
And we talk a lot about creatures specifically and aliens and all that other stuff is obviously

163
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,320
in that camp.

164
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:57,040
But a lot of people who deal with this stuff, spiritual things and are believers of spiritual

165
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,440
things are also sometimes very myopic and like, oh no, this is a modern phenomenon.

166
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,360
You're like, well, we've talked to people who say this stuff goes all the way back and

167
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,800
you've had UFO sightings hundreds and hundreds of years ago.

168
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,440
So what is that?

169
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,920
Is that true?

170
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,480
Is it false?

171
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,280
People making that up.

172
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,280
They didn't even have a context to even say what it was.

173
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,200
And they describe it almost exactly.

174
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,360
I would love to talk about that.

175
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,480
Yeah, there's a pattern match.

176
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,000
Those ideas and what you found in the text that...

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,600
Because obviously not a lot of people have access to ancient texts.

178
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,640
Like we just don't have...

179
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,160
I mean, we can look it up on the internet and we can look on like old newspaper articles,

180
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,600
but the average person just can't go waltz into the Vatican and read things.

181
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,640
And the Church of Rome was collecting.

182
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,560
I mean, obviously it was archiving, if you will.

183
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,520
This was the archival system at that point.

184
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,360
There weren't governments that were saving this stuff.

185
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,120
It had to do directly with Christendom.

186
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,960
I know you've talked about it in terms of like ascent narratives, right?

187
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,280
You have these events that are recorded and written down.

188
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
What are some of these that to you,

189
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,240
it's written as maybe something miraculous or in the Catholic tradition,

190
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,800
it's a saint and they have some sort of experience,

191
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,080
but when you read it through the lens of today,

192
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,800
you see what we would call like a UFO or experience.

193
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,880
Yeah, okay, so where the pattern matches.

194
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,760
Sure, yeah.

195
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,280
The ones that kind of blew my mind at the time in that time period, 2013 or so,

196
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,520
were ones that Catholics especially are...

197
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,760
And even regular Christians who are not Catholic,

198
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,920
they all know these saints, okay?

199
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,960
So one of them is Francis of Assisi.

200
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,840
Oh, Assisi, yeah.

201
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,120
Now, Francis of Assisi is like super well known because if you go to anybody's garden,

202
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,480
sometimes they'll have a statue and he has the animals around him

203
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,680
and the birds on his shoulder and such.

204
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,120
So that's Francis of Assisi.

205
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
He was like an original Steve Irwin, right?

206
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,760
He had all the animals.

207
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,120
That's right, yeah, he was.

208
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,960
He was, yeah, he spoke to the animals.

209
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,040
So the thing about this is that you do have to access these archives

210
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,480
and why?

211
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,040
Because even back in that time period,

212
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
when a person had one of these experiences,

213
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,600
and I'll go specifically into what happened to him.

214
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:27,440
And again, no offense to people who have their St. Francis card

215
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,200
and I'm just telling you what these documents say.

216
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,920
And then my interpretation.

217
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,480
So Francis, so he is a devout person, right?

218
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,640
So he has an inclination to know God, okay?

219
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,760
So people are born that have that inclination.

220
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,200
And so this leads him to become a monk.

221
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:58,080
And so first, let me finish talking about the accessing of these documents.

222
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,160
So in the United States, there's an archive in Philadelphia,

223
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,320
which is it's a Catholic archive and it has so much information

224
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,680
that's primary source information.

225
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,360
It goes back to the Aztecs.

226
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,760
Wow.

227
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,320
Yeah, so they have like stone records of like Aztecs.

228
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,920
Do you have to be an academic to get access?

229
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,000
You know, I think you do, but maybe not.

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,440
Is it hidden behind Mount Rushmore?

231
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,280
Is that the place Nick Cage went?

232
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,640
Is that when Nick Cage went like behind Mount Rushmore with a repository?

233
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,400
Of course there's a Nick Cage movie reference.

234
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,920
But you know, you have to be an academic.

235
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,640
What about Nick Cage?

236
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,840
How did he get in?

237
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,960
I know, I know.

238
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,160
Well, I don't actually know.

239
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,920
I know what the Vatican, you do have to be.

240
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,440
It's not necessarily an academic, but you have to have credentials that,

241
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,800
you know, that you've been studying.

242
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,360
Yeah, yeah.

243
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,800
It can't just be anyone who gets in.

244
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,520
But it might be at the Philly archive.

245
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,040
I'm not sure, but I'll look into it.

246
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,920
But it's just an incredible, I had, you know, a lot of the stuff is not digitized.

247
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,880
So you wouldn't know.

248
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,800
You have to actually be a nice person who's nice to the archivist.

249
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,560
Because if you walk in there and you're like,

250
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,960
I want to see these digitized things, which I did,

251
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,440
because I had seen them online and I was like, I want to see these things.

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,600
And then after day one, the archivist took liking to me and he's like,

253
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
do you want to see some really cool stuff?

254
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
And I'm like, yes, I do.

255
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,760
And so, you know, we went down, down, down into the earth, like six stories.

256
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,600
They have stuff six stories down.

257
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,400
And I was kind of afraid, you know, this rickety elevator.

258
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,320
And we get down there and we see things among them, stones of Aztec sacrifices,

259
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,440
like where you can actually see.

260
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,320
And I had a student with me who's now actually a professor.

261
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,480
And I was like thinking, am I going to trigger her?

262
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,640
You know, because these are like really bad, these are bad images, right?

263
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,560
But that's where I learned a lot of this stuff.

264
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,280
Okay, so you see the primary source documents of a lot of those people

265
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,920
who have these experiences actually don't write them down.

266
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,360
One person did, and that's Teresa of Avila, and I could talk about her too.

267
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,760
But so Francis goes out and he's doing a prayer to the archangels.

268
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,440
It's the feast of the archangels.

269
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,640
And he's doing this prayer on this mountain.

270
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,280
Okay, and this is in Italy in the 1200s.

271
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,400
And what happens is a seraph comes down.

272
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,360
I call it a seraph because that's what he called it.

273
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,200
Okay, and it looks like a seraph.

274
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,160
Who saw the seraph?

275
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,400
New song coming out.

276
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,280
You saw the seraph?

277
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,840
That's cool.

278
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,640
Some Rob Marley.

279
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,720
He did, he saw the seraph.

280
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,400
Anyway, keep going, bad joke.

281
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,440
No, that's all right.

282
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,160
I get that joke.

283
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,360
But do you know what you're looking for at this moment or no?

284
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,680
No.

285
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,720
You don't know what you're looking for?

286
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,200
No, no.

287
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,000
You have no idea?

288
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,920
I'm doing an examination of these documents because I want to know,

289
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,520
okay, wait a minute, something weird is happening.

290
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,240
And I would like to know, but I need a lot of data.

291
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,640
So you can't just go off one or two documents.

292
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,720
You need like hundreds of documents to say, this is the pattern match, right?

293
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,840
And this is one of the big ones.

294
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,760
And you can't just say that because Catholics will get upset at you.

295
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,320
Sure, he's a big one.

296
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,560
Yeah, so anyway, so he doesn't write anything, but this is written about him afterwards.

297
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,960
And so you have several different documents from...

298
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,600
Interesting.

299
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,200
Yeah, and they all say the same thing, but in different ways.

300
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,920
And they're all like in Latin and stuff like that, inaccessible types of things, right?

301
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,360
He does actually write something to one of his friends who's a younger

302
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,440
monk named Leo, Brother Leo.

303
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,520
He writes something very important that I think says something about this event.

304
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,640
But this is what happens to him.

305
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,480
So he's at this event, most likely Brother Leo's with him.

306
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,760
Some sources don't say that, but a lot of sources do.

307
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,480
And I believe that Brother Leo is most likely with him.

308
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,040
But here is Francis and he's praying.

309
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:55,120
And the seraph comes down and it basically has beams or something like light beams.

310
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,800
And we could talk about this in terms of Gary Nolan's work too,

311
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,240
because you know I work with Gary Nolan.

312
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,960
Oh yeah, I wanted to just definitely do that.

313
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,240
Yeah, so then he's hurt by this seraph, right?

314
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,120
He has some kind of telepathic communication with it too.

315
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,520
Really?

316
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,840
Yeah, so there's a telepathic communication.

317
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,800
I don't know if it intentionally hurts him, to tell you the truth.

318
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,360
And this is something we could talk about with respect to Gary Nolan's work.

319
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,320
He has this question.

320
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,680
He doesn't think it's intentional.

321
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,640
Okay, so this being then interacts with Francis.

322
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,080
Francis is wounded, okay?

323
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,360
And they go back to the monastery and they hide the wounds.

324
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,800
They don't want anyone else to see what has happened to Francis.

325
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,680
So it is called the stigmata, right?

326
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,400
The wounds of Christ.

327
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,960
And we talk about the stigma associated with phenomena today.

328
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,120
That's where, I mean, I think it starts there.

329
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,880
So there's no digital copy of this story anywhere?

330
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,520
There are.

331
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,920
Okay, but you're looking at the source materials.

332
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,720
You're not taking a copy.

333
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,040
You're looking at the actual writings.

334
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,640
Yeah, the thing is that I gave a talk on this in New York City like a year and a half ago,

335
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,920
I think, and I knew that people would want to know the sources.

336
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
So I created a bibliography.

337
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,800
And I have a feeling your viewers are the same.

338
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,840
Like they're going to want to see all this stuff and I'm happy to provide it.

339
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,880
So the thing about my field is it's transparent.

340
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Like if we have sources, we're not like the people in the special access programs

341
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,400
who can't share anything.

342
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,040
We do.

343
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,680
That's what we do.

344
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,040
And as an academic, you do peer review work too.

345
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
So it's all very much like...

346
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,080
Yeah, and Dr. Michael Heiser got us into this and it started basically

347
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,560
with the academic that helped this show get started.

348
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,800
Wow, you're lucky.

349
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,440
And he came on a couple of times in the early days,

350
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,640
but he would do the same thing.

351
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,200
And there's a lot of people taking shots at him now that he's even passed,

352
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,720
but I realized that all of his work was peer reviewed.

353
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,920
And it's cited and it's all...

354
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

355
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,040
You can't publish anything.

356
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,200
I mean, I've published with Oxford and it takes like...

357
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,880
Because I think in this space, there's so much conjecture

358
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,840
and everybody has an opinion because of course it's a phenomena, right?

359
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,120
But we always try to go back to the data.

360
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,160
What does the data say?

361
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,120
And that's why I love the empirical work.

362
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,280
Your work is empirical.

363
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,320
It's part of the scientific method and you're also compiling and citing these sources.

364
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,800
Well, it's cool because like John Mack and you,

365
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,960
and we need these academics to kind of push this subject into the mainstream

366
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,800
because nobody's going to take anybody else serious.

367
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,960
If you're like, oh, fire in the sky.

368
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,760
I'm just this guy that got abducted by this UFO.

369
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,880
And everyone's like, ah, you're just some guy and lives in a trailer.

370
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,360
And then we write it off, but we really do need the academics to help make it,

371
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,040
hey, this is happening.

372
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,680
Here's the data.

373
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,320
So I appreciate that.

374
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,600
So you were talking about John Mack.

375
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,680
Cece has stigmata, as you're saying.

376
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,120
This is where you think the stigma, if you will, comes from when it comes to this.

377
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,760
But what happens to him?

378
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,400
He gets back.

379
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,480
Yeah. So sadly, he ends up passing away, right?

380
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,080
And it's pretty serious.

381
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,640
From the event?

382
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,600
We don't actually know.

383
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,800
I can't say for sure.

384
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,640
My opinion is that probably because it looked like he was so wounded

385
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,440
that they didn't want to show his wounds to anybody.

386
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,960
How do you think he was wounded?

387
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,720
Like shot or just like?

388
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,920
No, it looks like he was.

389
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,080
It looks like some type of radiation or some kind of light.

390
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,800
This is the Gary Nolan.

391
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,880
So when you see those images of, by the way,

392
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,800
even when you see the representations and paintings of Francis of Cece,

393
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,080
and hopefully I'll send some for your viewers,

394
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,840
but it would be great if we had them up here.

395
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,640
You want to throw them on the screen?

396
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,680
There's a whole lineage.

397
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,880
Yeah, you could show some of them.

398
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,320
It's the stigmata.

399
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,120
Is this connected?

400
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,760
You know that Phil Schneider story when he goes down in the underground base

401
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,160
and he gets shot up and he gets cancer right after that?

402
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,360
Yeah, it's very similar.

403
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,440
So when I started to do my research show in about 2014, 2015,

404
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,200
aerospace people, well, even before that,

405
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,120
but a lot of people who were associated with aerospace companies and corporations

406
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,160
started to ask me for my research and data.

407
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,920
And so I was thought that was weird.

408
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,720
I thought it was weird.

409
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,080
I was like, okay, I'm just an academic doing this work that nobody,

410
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,120
you know, we all think it's interesting, but nobody else does.

411
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
And that's when you're when you're starting to shift and see it?

412
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,400
Yeah, that's when like when they started to then I began to speak with them.

413
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,320
And I recognize that they were looking at it like they asked me questions.

414
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,960
What kind of light did they report?

415
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,160
What was the color of it?

416
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,200
Where was this?

417
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,560
You know, they were looking at longitude, latitude, hotspot type things.

418
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,880
And they said, were any of the people damaged or hurt?

419
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,800
Like, were there any injuries?

420
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,200
And I was thinking, yeah, there are injuries.

421
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,440
And so, yeah, that's so there's a whole history of that, too, of that image.

422
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,640
It changes over time.

423
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,000
So in this in this one, this is probably an early one.

424
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,840
I don't know if you can see Brother Leo in there,

425
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,040
but usually you see Brother Leo in there.

426
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,960
There might Brother Leo might be behind them.

427
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,760
Yeah, I think so.

428
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,880
Right up the top there.

429
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,680
But see how this they're portraying this as as the serif.

430
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,840
He said that I came out to look at him.

431
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,960
Or at least Brother Leo said that because he presumably witnesses this.

432
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,480
OK, so there's two guys there.

433
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,760
Yeah, there's two guys there.

434
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,200
And Brother Leo is usually in the shadows somewhere witnessing this.

435
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,840
And it's not necessarily the case that Jesus is there.

436
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,400
So he's not sure he sees an eye, but that later gets interpreted to be Jesus.

437
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,640
OK, so they're not.

438
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,960
So that's what I'm saying is that there are different ways of interpreting.

439
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,080
There's one with Brother Leo.

440
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,480
That's a later version of that representation.

441
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,520
But you can see the radiation stuff or the light beams or whatever you want to call them.

442
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,920
And this imparts upon him the wounds of Christ.

443
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,200
Now, we could talk about that because it appears that if this is a serif,

444
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:52,080
there's a tradition here of angel mysticism, of people being contacted by angels

445
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,560
and angels imparting knowledge like the Jacob contact event.

446
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,120
And it looks to be very powerful, a very powerful.

447
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,960
There's a lot of skeptics who think that sometimes those can be nefarious.

448
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,400
Do you see any signs?

449
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
In many cases, I think that they are.

450
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,120
So right now, I am now telling people.

451
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,200
And by the way, this doesn't reflect my university's position.

452
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,280
My university doesn't have anything to say about angel events and things like that.

453
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,720
They're OK with me doing this.

454
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,200
Very happy.

455
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,240
You can put it all on blurry.

456
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,800
It's fine.

457
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,520
We'll take it.

458
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,280
It was interesting about that in addition to this situation where you have an injury

459
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:38,800
or you have this UFO or angel injury is what you're just talking about as well.

460
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,840
We talk a lot about Genesis 6 in our show where you have the watchers,

461
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,120
the rebellious angels that they show up and what they do, they impart knowledge.

462
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,240
They trade knowledge for wives.

463
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,400
But the angels themselves don't feel dangerous.

464
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,280
It could be the technology that they're moving around in because

465
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,440
there's also these stories where at UFO land and some farmers property,

466
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
nothing grows around that area.

467
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,480
So could the craft that maybe they're rolling in on be the thing that hurts people?

468
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:08,880
Yeah.

469
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,560
This is something that people are trying to figure out as well.

470
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,160
So I do want to say this.

471
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,080
There's this congressional hearing right now.

472
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,640
The work that's being done that's the actual work to move this forward

473
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,200
is not in the congressional hearing.

474
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,120
That's helpful.

475
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,320
And I love it that it's happening because before we walked into the studio,

476
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:37,360
I heard Lou Elizondo talk about people being harassed for doing this work.

477
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,040
And I'm one of those people.

478
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,800
And so I'm happy that this is happening even if it's not super deep,

479
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,280
what's going on in Congress, I don't care.

480
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,480
I'm happy that he's coming out and saying people are doing this.

481
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,400
Because the people who do have knowledge about it, and by the way,

482
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,000
it looks now that I've written American Cosmic and it's been a few years

483
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,600
and the whole thing is happening.

484
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,800
I basically wrote about one of those unacknowledged SAPs, Special Access Programs.

485
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,240
And so in a sense, I'm one of those people who know.

486
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,160
So if they want the whistleblowers, thank goodness they're not asking me.

487
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,400
But if they want to know about it, it's in that book.

488
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,960
So we have a unique opportunity then with you sitting here.

489
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,920
We don't know what's happening at the moment as far as what's going on in the hearing,

490
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,400
but the last one we know what happened.

491
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,000
Your experiences, we talked about with Tyler last time on the show.

492
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,720
To refresh on our last episode, he's a Space Force, if I'm correct here,

493
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,640
he's a Space Force, also an astrophysicist or an aerospace engineer.

494
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,000
I don't remember which one it is.

495
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,440
But he takes you places and shows you some things that exist.

496
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,640
So having that and having seen things and knowing folks on the inside,

497
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,400
what are your thoughts about the initial stuff that came out?

498
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,280
Like, do you think David Grush is telling the truth about what potentially these factions,

499
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,360
unregulated factions as it would be of our government perhaps have?

500
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,720
Because they said a lot of things, which were covered craft,

501
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,560
which I know you went to a crash site, right?

502
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,440
Talk about that.

503
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,000
And also they talk about non-human biologics, which is a very interesting revelation.

504
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,760
Does all of that jive with the stuff that you have?

505
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
It feels like a very massage press release.

506
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,080
Yeah. Okay. So I think I don't know exactly what's happening.

507
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,320
I'll just say that except that I do know that right now,

508
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,600
directly after American Cosmic was published, you talked to me a little bit

509
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,520
right as that was happening, a lot happened, okay?

510
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,120
Part of what happened was that I got to meet a lot of the...

511
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,160
I met all the people in the Invisible College.

512
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,640
In fact, I think that they consider me a part of it.

513
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,320
So even though I don't consider myself...

514
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,400
Explain this though, because we didn't get into this.

515
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,920
This is something I was going to ask you that you touched on with Joe Rogan,

516
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,480
but he never strung this out.

517
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,720
And it was fascinating to me.

518
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,520
You have the Invisible College and then you have what you called this Pencils Up,

519
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,480
this oral tradition of a UFO narrative that exists that isn't written down.

520
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,080
Can you talk about that for a bit and we can maybe pull a few of those strings?

521
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,840
Because I feel like Joe moved on quickly and I was like, what is this?

522
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:38,800
It's okay because the thing is that it sounds so weird that I have said no to...

523
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,760
I know.

524
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,800
I have said no to some of the...

525
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,040
You would know their names like Joe Rogan and blah, blah, blah,

526
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,400
because I don't want to say it publicly because it's that weird.

527
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,760
But I said it yesterday on Sean Ryan and I'm going to say it here.

528
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,720
There's a level to what's happening that's a...

529
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,560
I would call it a non-human level.

530
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,400
When people talk about what is spiritual warfare and that type of thing,

531
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,120
it's indicative to me that something like that is happening.

532
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,080
When we're talking about this Pencils Up tradition, first off, there's now talk about this

533
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,680
unacknowledged special access program called Immaculate Conception.

534
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,280
I promise you that's not what it's called.

535
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,640
And also, they will change the name, so it'll be changed and it'll be numbers,

536
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,480
or else it'll be something that is passed along orally.

537
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,440
There's an oral tradition.

538
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,480
This thing that gets imparted to Francis is knowledge,

539
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,000
but it also could be something that's transmitted to his monks

540
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,600
and then gets transmitted over time.

541
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,480
Telepathically.

542
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,680
Yeah, or some kind of...

543
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,040
Or just like orally, it's like pre-written history, right?

544
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,800
You have the Bibles passed down orally until it's written down, presumably by Moses.

545
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,240
But you have these...

546
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,960
A lot of people contend on our show that's how all the Biblical writers really got the

547
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,000
kind of being told these things to write it down.

548
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,360
Yeah, I think so.

549
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,440
Because how does it all match and flow and over centuries and time and it's like,

550
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,200
this book supports this book and so on.

551
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
It's like a living document and the only way that...

552
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,840
That's right.

553
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,720
I just don't think human beings could be as involved with that process as we probably

554
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,000
would think if we were just rational, like the rational discussion.

555
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,040
Oh yeah, they wrote this book down.

556
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,840
But it seems like there's something entirely different happening with Scripture.

557
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,040
And you see Jordan Peterson on talking about all this all the time because he's...

558
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,520
I don't know where his faith is, but he's mesmerized by the Bible itself.

559
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,400
And I think that's because there are higher entities involved in

560
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,760
communicating the message to us.

561
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,960
But that's my take.

562
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,560
Yeah, I personally feel that.

563
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,640
So this is nothing I could do peer review.

564
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,240
Like you can't, you know, oh, that oral tradition that's unacknowledged,

565
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,360
let's peer review that.

566
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,000
You can't do that.

567
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,200
What is it then?

568
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,960
It feels like esoteric secret knowledge, right?

569
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,600
That's kind of how it feels like, oh, we've got this meta-narrative that's the truth

570
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,400
that is not being written down, but it's being passed from...

571
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,920
Is this what the Invisible College is?

572
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,760
These people who kind of hold this knowledge about what's really happening?

573
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,400
Is that...

574
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,200
Well, okay, so the Invisible College is filled with scientists

575
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,520
who've been working on UAP UFOs for more than 40 years.

576
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,720
Okay, so they're all like in their 70s and 80s now.

577
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,960
And when did Jacques Vellet help put off...

578
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,800
Since the great age of the 80s?

579
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,400
Since then?

580
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,320
The great age.

581
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,240
True, true.

582
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,440
All the way back to the 80s.

583
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
It looks a lot like this in some ways.

584
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,160
Even in the 50s, some of them have been working on it since the 50s.

585
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,200
So, you know, Alan Hynek...

586
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,320
We don't know that decade here.

587
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,440
It's Roswell, so you have this sort of modern American...

588
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,640
So there's this lineage.

589
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,480
Now, the thing about them is that...

590
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,000
And excuse me if they hear this, I'm sorry.

591
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,240
They're not part of this special access program.

592
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
It's good they're invisible, so they don't know.

593
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,640
They're on the academic side, so they're not top-secret clearance.

594
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,520
No, they may be even, but they're not...

595
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,080
I know from interacting with them that they don't know what Tyler...

596
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,480
Knows.

597
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,040
And it doesn't seem like they'll be able to.

598
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,720
They're surprised even when they hear...

599
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,760
Do you feel like there's just several different factions

600
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,480
all realizing they can't bottle this up anymore,

601
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,720
and everyone wants to get in control, who gets to break the story?

602
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,680
I think that's going on.

603
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,400
Yeah, I think right now that part of the government

604
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,800
is basically trying to manage the situation,

605
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,080
but there's part of the government...

606
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,640
See, they're not even in alignment with each other.

607
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,480
And so I've been in the crossfire of that.

608
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,480
And then you said there's Angelic who are also part of the disclosure?

609
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,760
Honestly, I think that we're in a space

610
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,480
where good things are happening on that front,

611
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,840
and it seems like there's a lot of pushback to that.

612
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,400
And for people who want to know the truth, there's pushback to those people.

613
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,400
And that's unfortunate, but that has always been the case, by the way.

614
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,400
If you look at the truth tellers, it's not been great for them, really, in the end.

615
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,960
But they do it anyway, right?

616
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,240
And I think maybe we're at a place where it might be okay to say the truth now.

617
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,440
What are some of the bigger parts of this oral narrative?

618
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,680
Does it have to do with recovery or the donation of these?

619
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,400
Yeah, so if you look again, now I even look at my own book,

620
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,840
because now I'm thinking...

621
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,360
Because I just documented it.

622
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,280
I think I told you all at the time that it was like mad furious rush

623
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,600
just to document what I was experiencing.

624
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,480
And now when I go back and reread it, I can't believe what I wrote,

625
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,000
because I say, okay, now that's true.

626
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,720
That came true.

627
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,040
And this is what he was talking about.

628
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,560
And so what you were asking me, what is it about?

629
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,880
Well, it's important to know that this is a person who was in the Space Force

630
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,600
and part of the Space Shuttle Program for its duration.

631
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,760
And very patriotic.

632
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:19,840
And then most likely looks like a crash retrieval program took me to a site.

633
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,920
I work with Gary.

634
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,000
He and I and Gary worked for a while together.

635
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,880
And then what happened was he converted to hardcore Christianity.

636
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,640
After seeing those documents, those primary source documents that I showed him,

637
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:39,360
he then recognized what he was doing and who he was interacting with.

638
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,880
Just like I did.

639
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,600
So in a sense, that book reveals my conversion and his conversion,

640
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,880
even though he's already Christian.

641
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,560
I was like, wow, it's real more than I thought it was.

642
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,600
Even though I believed it.

643
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,080
Well, yeah, we were talking about that yesterday.

644
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,880
Moses had a magical staff.

645
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,520
You know that.

646
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:04,080
You grow up coloring those things and the children's department at the church.

647
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,280
And then something happens in us where we get older

648
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,280
and we just don't believe it as much or at all.

649
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,480
But we still believe in God, right?

650
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,360
That's right, yeah.

651
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,120
And it's such a strange thing that happens.

652
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,440
And then you see a UFO or you see Bigfoot or you see something you shouldn't see.

653
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,760
And then all of a sudden you go, wait a minute.

654
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,080
Like you just become awake to the fact that this is all spiritual.

655
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,000
Everything happening is spiritual.

656
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,640
And that's another part of this conversation I wanted to talk.

657
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,920
I don't know if you were done with this or not,

658
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,040
but where the physical meets the spiritual.

659
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,080
Because that's the most confusing part of all this

660
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,040
is because you have a lot of Christians like,

661
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,840
oh, it's just demons.

662
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,560
It's just spirits.

663
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,520
It's just deceptions.

664
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,040
You're like, but you went and like...

665
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,920
Well, yeah, we have an exorcist came on the show and said it's just a manifestation.

666
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,880
UFO is just a manifestation.

667
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,760
But we have craft.

668
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,200
We have nuts and bolts.

669
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,800
And you talk about holding and touching these materials.

670
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,400
And Gary Nolan is collecting.

671
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,360
I want to see his collection.

672
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,320
He's collecting these things.

673
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,840
Yeah, he is, yeah.

674
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,760
Like one of our bigger episodes was a Mormon missionary

675
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,160
where he befriends a government trapper in Roswell, New Mexico.

676
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,800
And he found a piece of this craft and he had it with all of his...

677
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,680
Bear traps and everything else.

678
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,440
And he shows these Mormon missionary like, hey, check this out.

679
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,040
And there's markings on it, ancient markings, like weird languages.

680
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,080
And they try to even just put a little dent in it and they can't.

681
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,920
And take that story for what it is,

682
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
but it's all documented in like the 70s.

683
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,080
And he sent these letters back to his parents.

684
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,880
And then his son finds them and then listens to our show and goes, whoa,

685
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,880
why is this involved in my dad's like Mormon missionary stories?

686
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,040
Writing to my parents, he just happens to...

687
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,960
But there's like, that's a long story, but there are pieces of wreckage.

688
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,880
Like how often do you hear spiritual stories

689
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,360
that just are around the evidence is there.

690
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,680
You could go and it doesn't happen, right?

691
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,680
Demons aren't building things.

692
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,320
So we have to figure out what that is.

693
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,080
How does the spiritual and physical collide?

694
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,360
Yeah. So, okay.

695
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:16,080
Now, I know this sounds odd, but this is what my Purgatory book was about.

696
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,240
Because I start off with a way too long introduction, by the way.

697
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,560
So if anybody reads that book, you can skip the introduction

698
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,120
unless you're interested in Vatican II, okay?

699
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,600
All right.

700
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,280
Which I'm sure you probably aren't.

701
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,880
But it is interesting for Catholics.

702
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,680
Yes. So I start off by talking about this cave

703
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,360
that people would go into in 1200, even before that.

704
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,960
So for hundreds of years, they're Christian, they're Irish.

705
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,000
And this is like 700, 800, 900, right?

706
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,440
So a long time ago.

707
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,760
And they would go into this cave to basically go through the afterlife.

708
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,320
So the afterlife wasn't something that you just experienced when you were dead, right?

709
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,520
So my question was in that book,

710
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,520
how did Purgatory become something that was supernatural and non-material?

711
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,120
Because back in the day, when people thought of Purgatory,

712
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,480
it was actually a place.

713
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,800
And it was a thing that people experienced.

714
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,280
And they met demons and they fought them and things like that.

715
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,400
Like they went to the underworld somehow?

716
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,880
Yeah, they just went through a cave door and they were there.

717
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,480
It reminds me of like the gates of hell at Mount Hermon.

718
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,360
That is it. Yeah, the gates of hell.

719
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,200
It's a real cave they believed was the entrance to the underworld.

720
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,920
So you think it was actually like you go into the cave and you go down, but you're still alive?

721
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,720
Oh, no. Yeah.

722
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,240
So if you survive it, then your sins are forgiven.

723
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,000
That was their version of Purgatory.

724
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,280
So the important point is that during the late modern or the early modern period,

725
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:51,760
there was a shift toward the belief that angels and demons and spiritual things were non-material.

726
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,440
Well, why?

727
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
That was my question in the Purgatory book.

728
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,880
And we inherited that culture, that there's a dichotomy between spirit and matter.

729
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,360
Now, this is something that I hear exorcists say, not all of them, but a lot of them say,

730
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,840
well, angels and demons are non-material.

731
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,960
They're non-material.

732
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,240
Well, okay, wait a minute.

733
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,960
If you go back to the Bible, there are very real effects of these non-material.

734
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,160
Yes, let's go.

735
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,040
Yeah, they eat.

736
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,520
Yeah, that's right.

737
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,160
They wrestle.

738
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,720
Yeah, exactly.

739
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,520
They walk into Sodom.

740
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,120
They dislocate Jacob's...

741
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,040
Are you talking demons or are you talking angels?

742
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,000
We're talking about angels here.

743
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,720
Yeah, yeah.

744
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,000
Yeah, both of them.

745
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,240
Demons, by definition, are disembodied spirits.

746
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,600
So they have this capability to do that.

747
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,760
So when we then, we've inherited that worldview.

748
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,320
So to us, nothing exists other than what we...

749
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,280
That's how we lose our faith, right?

750
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,320
When we say we have our faith, we abstractly believe in God, even when we're Christian.

751
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,280
Colonel Carle-Nell, I posted a quote from him on, I think it was in Instagram the other day,

752
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,120
where he basically does this talk and he says that people are now going to have to confront

753
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:04,720
the fact that what they believe, their religious belief, like of angels and so forth, he said,

754
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,280
is actually real and that's going to be difficult.

755
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,720
Yeah.

756
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,120
It reminds me of just like, we're on both sides of this coin because you have the Bigfoot

757
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,080
scientists who are trying to say, this is an animal, right?

758
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,440
Bigfoot is just an animal.

759
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,120
There's nothing woo going on with...

760
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,160
And then you have Christians say, it's just spiritual deception.

761
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,920
It's not actually physical either.

762
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,280
So you have these two camps that acknowledge that Bigfoot's a thing,

763
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,960
but they don't agree on what it is.

764
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,880
And then you hear people come on our show and say, it does both those things.

765
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
It leaves footprints and it disappears.

766
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,800
And you're like, wait, how does that happen?

767
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,840
How does that work?

768
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,400
And so you can't stay in one side for very long.

769
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,520
Or you just have to deny all these stories and all these encounters and all these experiences.

770
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,160
And I think that you're trying to do that to the angelic world and say,

771
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,520
maybe they build craft.

772
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,880
Maybe they arrive on craft.

773
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,320
Maybe they're a part of these things flying around.

774
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,640
And a lot of people hate Luke and I for saying that.

775
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,560
That, you know, it's in some of our imagery.

776
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,080
It's obviously in the intro to the show.

777
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,440
We show that on Mount Hermon where these angels show up.

778
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,320
How do they get there?

779
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,040
Do they just pop into existence or do they have to

780
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,440
come from point A to get to point B?

781
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:16,560
I think they more likely had to travel somehow and get here.

782
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,600
And that's how they move around.

783
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,360
And that's what we're seeing since the dawn of time.

784
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,800
But it's hard because we don't know which are the good ones,

785
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,000
which ones are the bad ones.

786
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,440
And what are they doing and why?

787
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,640
And to that note, Danny, can we circle back to Saint Francis because

788
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,320
we were talking about his injuries and you were saying that what you read

789
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,160
seemed like radiation.

790
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,840
Last time I spoke with Gary about it, he didn't believe that it was intentional.

791
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,280
He thought it was like collateral damage from being close to.

792
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,920
So he was doing this work in at least 2017.

793
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,680
Probably 2015, I'm thinking.

794
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:05,280
But he had a lot of data and shared it with me when we were in New Mexico going to that site.

795
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,400
And so that's what clued me in.

796
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,920
And even earlier with people asking me, the aerospace engineers,

797
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,120
are there injuries involved with these angel events?

798
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,600
You know, and well, yeah, I hadn't thought about that, honestly,

799
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,240
because we're just sadly trained to see angel events in a certain way, right?

800
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,520
So many images show us what angels look like.

801
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,320
Wrestling, right?

802
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,240
Is that what is happening?

803
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,920
We see most people don't read the Bible, so you don't get those stories, right?

804
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,680
And so they're not passed on.

805
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,120
They're not talked about in church.

806
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,720
Well, it took you a long time to know what you were looking for as well as anybody else

807
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,600
in these spaces, where it's almost as if God chooses you for this path and this journey,

808
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,840
because it takes a kind of skeptical mind but open mind at the same time.

809
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,040
And usually human beings are on kind of one side of these things.

810
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,160
But academic, too.

811
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,280
So there's a method.

812
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,560
It's methodical, right?

813
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,320
You're creating a case.

814
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,040
Yes.

815
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,760
So in the case of...

816
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,760
But you can also just dismiss things or put them in an entirely different category,

817
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,520
like the sons of God in Genesis 6 aren't angels.

818
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
They're just a race of humans.

819
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,240
Let's done, move on.

820
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,120
And then you have all these other academics like, no, no, no.

821
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,040
The language doesn't say that.

822
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,400
These are different.

823
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,680
This is not human beings on, you know, and even the language says,

824
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,600
you know, took the daughters of men.

825
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:34,960
I think we as humans can create categories because we're afraid of what that means.

826
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,960
There's angels and humans hanging out.

827
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,920
How does that possible?

828
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,800
Exactly.

829
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,040
Yeah.

830
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,200
So there are unanswered questions.

831
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:47,280
And as we go on with what's happening with the official disclosure going on, right?

832
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,520
It's really interesting to look back on the questions that we have unanswered.

833
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:01,040
And so I think that's why, honestly, it's so strange for me because I did that research

834
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,840
not knowing what a crash retrieval program was, not having that language,

835
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,560
not even believing in UFOs.

836
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:16,160
So I did it fresh from the perspective of the scholar of religion and then becoming shocked.

837
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,360
But I keep going.

838
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,600
There were times when I didn't want to continue, by the way.

839
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,960
Yeah, I can imagine.

840
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,600
Same with us.

841
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,240
It's like, you know, you're just kicking so many things around that you,

842
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,160
like we have the, you know, we have all the, we have the Mormons listening,

843
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,520
the Flat Earthers listening, you know, the Catholics listening, the Christians listening,

844
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,880
and they all get mad at us, but for different reasons.

845
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,440
And they're very vocal about certain things.

846
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,320
I'm sure you've had a lot of conversations with exorcists about these things.

847
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:46,880
I have.

848
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,160
And how does that go?

849
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,680
Well, I had one, and these are amazing people, okay,

850
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,760
because devoting your life to doing that is pretty hardcore.

851
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,320
I think we can all agree on that.

852
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,280
So one of them suggested that I get out of this work because of the spiritual danger.

853
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,960
So around 2020, I had been giving all kinds of talks,

854
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,240
like if a person asked me to go talk at their university or whatnot,

855
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,160
or their, you know, church or whatnot, I'd do it.

856
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,640
And there would be mediums in the audience, people who,

857
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,200
Really?

858
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:21,840
Yes.

859
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,440
And I would think, okay, that's an interesting choice of career.

860
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,680
However, they would then say, and that person in your slide,

861
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,440
like of a government agent or whatnot, that person's my boss.

862
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,600
And so this type of thing would keep happening to me to the point

863
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,640
where I knew that this was, I was being targeted,

864
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,480
and this was something that was not cool with me because what do mediums do?

865
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,800
They get access to information that they have in a weird way, right?

866
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,240
In a way that's not conventional.

867
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,160
Like we're talking here, it's not through talking.

868
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:54,560
Yeah.

869
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,320
And so I recognized then, so the exorcist said,

870
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,440
these things are going to happen to you and people will give you things.

871
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,480
People give you things and you have to get those,

872
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,120
you have to get rid of those, give them to a priest that can get rid of them.

873
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,160
So you're talking about witchcraft.

874
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,000
I mean, literally that's a medium.

875
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,360
It's like the medium witch of Endor, right?

876
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,480
You're really just talking about a witch.

877
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,600
It's just vernacular, right?

878
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,400
Yeah, like hexed items, cursed items, and things like that.

879
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,880
So again, I got a lot of things.

880
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,760
And so I had never thought about it from that point of view.

881
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,000
Not Taco Bell cups, though, if we can get one of those.

882
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,640
Those are blessed.

883
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,960
They were filled with holy water before.

884
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,760
It's something that academics don't want to talk about because it,

885
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,400
and I don't blame them, frankly, it is just very outside of our comfort zone,

886
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,160
you know, and also weird for them.

887
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,200
Well, it takes a long time.

888
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,200
It took me, you know, about a decade to kind of connect Bigfoot to these things.

889
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,760
You know, you start out there and then it was David Politis in Missing Forum One,

890
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,480
the data of people going missing where you couldn't,

891
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,040
every single explanation was finally off the table.

892
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,360
People are going from our world to somewhere else.

893
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,880
And you have to go, okay, UFOs are real.

894
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,600
And these abductions or portals or something is real.

895
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,480
It's not an animal.

896
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,280
It's not a bear.

897
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,160
It's not Bigfoot.

898
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,280
It's not the Wendigo.

899
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,280
It's something unexplainable is happening.

900
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,080
And so the UFO abduction phenomenon starts to come into the conversation.

901
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,920
Year eight, nine into researching these topics where you're already open-minded.

902
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,560
You're already down that road and you go, okay, now I have room for this.

903
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,400
And I'm not skeptical.

904
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,920
I don't know what I believe about it.

905
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,960
Let's just hear the data.

906
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,240
Let's hear the stories.

907
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,880
And I think guys like John Mack were like having all these people

908
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,320
telling the same story over and over again.

909
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,600
You have to be like, either I'm not going to listen to people

910
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,600
and say they're all nuts or this is happening.

911
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,200
Well, he did a psychiatric analysis on those people.

912
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,600
And he found that in every way, they were normal, except for that one thing.

913
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,800
They're them saying, well, I was abducted by aliens, right?

914
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,600
And he was like, sorry, but these are completely normal people.

915
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,760
I think that's why you need shows like this and people like you

916
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,360
to kind of push this on the mainstream.

917
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,160
And I think that for some reason, a lot of Christians are afraid

918
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,040
of these topics, these conversations, or very quick to say,

919
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,520
it's demons, don't talk about it anymore.

920
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,320
That's it, it's done.

921
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,840
But that's not what the data says.

922
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,400
And I think that's why we started here in this conversation.

923
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,080
We've moved past that over the years.

924
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,280
And if you're still there, stay with us, hopefully.

925
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,840
But there's more data and I'd love to talk about that

926
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,920
where your mind starts to go, okay, you're at a crash retrieval.

927
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,200
You're looking at the pieces, you're touching stuff.

928
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,720
What's going through your mind then in terms of your faith?

929
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,960
Yeah, so Tyler, this person, enigmatic person who is affiliated

930
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,560
with all these government institutions has the clearances.

931
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,640
And so he takes Gary Nolan and I, Gary is a professor at Stanford,

932
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,440
a scientist, and we go to this.

933
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,560
And by the way, I invited Gary because I didn't want to go by myself.

934
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,520
So we go to this place.

935
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,440
You don't want to be blindfolded and say someone by yourself?

936
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,000
No, I did not.

937
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,880
Probably smart move.

938
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:05,860
Yeah.

939
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,640
We had to be blindfolded to a secret place.

940
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,080
So it's in New Mexico.

941
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:15,840
It was a crash site from apparently one of the ones in the 1940s, not Roswell.

942
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,560
And so at that point, I'm not believing.

943
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,320
I'm not believing that it's real.

944
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,840
I think that maybe it's a setup.

945
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,840
Maybe they're trying to plant disinformation.

946
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,440
Gary's on my side.

947
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,120
We're both academics.

948
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:33,440
And so we both kind of talk to each other as the day goes on and we do find debris.

949
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,920
You know, we're like, is this a setup for us?

950
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,320
And Gary's like, well, I'm the one who's going to assess these materials and we'll find out.

951
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,360
You know, and I was like, yeah.

952
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,520
So anyway, so we got the stuff and it looks like metallic frog skin.

953
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,360
So everybody asked me, what does it look like?

954
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,120
So it looks like metallic frog skin.

955
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,320
And Gary's going to take it-

956
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,600
Big pieces, small pieces?

957
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,720
Big and small pieces, we found.

958
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,400
And it wasn't easy to find, by the way.

959
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,600
It was underneath rubble and buried, like really deep.

960
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:16,320
And the rubble, by the way, this is why I'm really grateful to my then self for taking

961
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:23,200
good notes, you know, because the rubble was important because I didn't understand it.

962
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,800
Tyler told me that it was disintegrated cans, aluminum cans from the 1950s.

963
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,240
After they excavated the craft, they didn't want anybody else out there looking for this stuff.

964
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:39,520
But my editor of the book, my Oxford editor, so she said,

965
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,680
this is weird, Diana, you can't put this in there.

966
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,720
Like, why would there be rubble out in the middle of the desert?

967
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,040
You know, and I said, well, you're right.

968
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,320
It is weird, but we have to keep it in there because we don't know.

969
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,960
But it was there.

970
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,560
Like, I'm not going to say it wasn't there.

971
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,200
You know, I'm supposed to be an honest person here.

972
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,480
When they're doing that, so your metal detector doesn't work, right?

973
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,440
Like, is it to kind of cover-

974
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,280
Yeah, that's right, to put off the metal detector.

975
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,920
So basically, you can't find the thing and you can't find the needle in the haystack

976
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,840
because it all pings, right?

977
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,120
We heard the same thing about that book, The Long Walk, when he sees the family of Yeti,

978
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,720
when he's trying to get out of Siberia, going through Siberia.

979
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,640
Where's this going?

980
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,760
Well, it's just the idea.

981
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,800
The editor told him, take it out of the book.

982
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,680
Because you're telling this story about how you escaped a prison camp.

983
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,320
You don't want to be talking about a family of Yeti that you saw on the way home.

984
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,960
You know, let's cut that out of the book.

985
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,640
But I think that there's a part of every author,

986
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,240
it does not have to be objected to the truth.

987
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,200
I have to say what happened.

988
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:39,760
You have to.

989
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,920
Yeah, it's really important.

990
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,320
This sort of observation then is-

991
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,280
Yeah, you're there.

992
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:45,840
You're seeing it.

993
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,720
You're holding it.

994
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,360
Do you have to dig?

995
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,080
How far are you going?

996
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,880
10 feet down?

997
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,520
Six feet down?

998
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,800
How far down do you go to find these pieces?

999
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,360
Yeah, so Gary goes down, it looks like three feet down.

1000
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:53,760
Three feet down.

1001
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,920
So he spends almost all day at this one rock

1002
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,000
because Tyler had configured the metal detectors to identify this stuff.

1003
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,920
He knows what he's doing.

1004
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,800
What kind of metal is it?

1005
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:03,840
We don't know.

1006
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,280
They're anomalous.

1007
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,480
So according to Gary, who then comes back and says to us months later,

1008
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,240
I've done the initial look at these and they're so far-

1009
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,840
But it's setting off the metal detector.

1010
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,320
Yeah, yeah.

1011
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:22,400
So he's looking for a certain type of metal, I guess, and knows what it is.

1012
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,360
It's an alloy probably.

1013
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,160
And I don't know as a non-scientist.

1014
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,360
Is it light?

1015
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:27,680
Is it-

1016
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:28,880
The metal?

1017
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,120
Yeah.

1018
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,280
Yeah, it's super light.

1019
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,800
What's the biggest piece that you guys found?

1020
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,040
So probably the biggest piece was probably like this big.

1021
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,960
Size of a Subway sandwich?

1022
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,280
Yeah.

1023
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,560
Like bigger than a VHS?

1024
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,960
Yeah, bigger than a VHS.

1025
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,200
And then we found a bunch of small parts and there were some other types of things too.

1026
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:48,960
A couple questions.

1027
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,680
What other type of things did you find out there besides, was it pieces of some other stuff?

1028
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,560
Yeah, no, it was apparently part of it, but it didn't look like the frog's-

1029
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,400
So you're saying frog skin, you're saying it's wavy, it's got texture or it just shines that way?

1030
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,840
It's wavy, it has texture like bumpy, you know, like frog skin has.

1031
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,440
And like if you took a frog and you took his skin off, that's what it would look like,

1032
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,920
but it was metal looking and kind of dark metal.

1033
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,440
When did you do this again?

1034
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,760
This was in, oh, let's see, probably 2017.

1035
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,360
Wow, so pretty recent.

1036
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,000
Yes.

1037
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,720
It's still out there.

1038
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,080
And that busts your paradigm, right?

1039
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,960
Because you're at this point, you said you weren't really a believer,

1040
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,360
you were just sort of chasing this narrative and then you're like, I'm holding this.

1041
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,000
I knew that there was something there that was substantial,

1042
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,200
but I didn't believe it was what I was going to find out.

1043
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,440
And also part of it was the context was that Tyler was bizarre.

1044
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,000
He didn't have to go through TSA at the airport.

1045
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,800
So many weird things about that guy.

1046
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,840
And so he told us what would happen to Gary once he got through.

1047
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,840
The airport, so we had to take this stuff back, right?

1048
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,160
And so I say, I'm not taking it.

1049
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,840
You put it in your bag, Gary.

1050
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,560
Yeah, I did.

1051
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,720
I said, you take it, Gary, you're going to analyze it.

1052
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,920
Let him take it through here.

1053
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,640
Yeah.

1054
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,400
And so Gary's like, oh, I'll take it.

1055
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,840
I'll take it in my backpack.

1056
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,560
So Tyler said, okay, this is going to happen to you, Gary.

1057
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,800
You're going to get stopped.

1058
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,040
And don't worry, though, you'll get it.

1059
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,760
They're not going to, even if they find it, they're not going to know what it is

1060
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,880
and they don't care.

1061
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,240
But whatever, it's going to be tagged and flagged.

1062
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,840
And so you'll probably be known.

1063
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,680
And Gary's like, I don't care about that.

1064
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,040
And so, but he was sweating when he went through the airport.

1065
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,920
Yeah, it all happened.

1066
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,520
Yeah, it all happened exactly.

1067
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,280
So Tyler sailed through, I go through TSA, Gary goes through TSA, gets stopped.

1068
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,880
And I'm watching and I'm afraid for him, frankly.

1069
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,040
And then I get out and Tyler's just hanging out there with his glass of water.

1070
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,480
And Tyler has some of the craft and Gary has all of it.

1071
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:54,800
Yeah.

1072
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,040
Okay.

1073
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,120
Why wouldn't Tyler carry it if he can just go through TSA?

1074
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,920
I have no idea.

1075
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,880
I mean, interesting.

1076
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,000
Because he just breezes through.

1077
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,880
Just take it with you, pal.

1078
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,640
Put it in your laptop bag.

1079
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,840
And you spent just one day digging for this stuff?

1080
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,400
Yeah.

1081
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,440
And you found all of that.

1082
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,560
What is Gary's conclusions then once he gets it back to the lab?

1083
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:18,880
So, okay, so again, he, at this point, and I checked this before I went on the Joe Rogan

1084
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,240
podcast, I checked it with Gary.

1085
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,560
So I texted him and say, okay, I'm going to go on Joe Rogan.

1086
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,400
What can't I say or can I say about this stuff that you found?

1087
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,400
And he said, oh, he just said it was anomalous.

1088
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:38,080
And he said that we found anomalous, that of his stuff, he found anomalous stuff

1089
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,000
that's been found at a place where people have seen a craft.

1090
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,760
So are they related?

1091
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,560
He can't say.

1092
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:44,800
Sure.

1093
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,440
Right?

1094
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:45,600
But-

1095
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,560
It's a very scientific answer.

1096
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,840
Something we can't explain that was found at a place purportedly where there was an

1097
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,840
associated with a crash.

1098
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,480
Any serial numbers on there or any writing or anything?

1099
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,440
No, no.

1100
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,880
And why do you think they crash?

1101
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,520
Yeah, so that's a question.

1102
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,280
So some people have this theory, and this is what Gary's theory is,

1103
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,240
is that, and this is what Tyler's theory is too, is that it's a donation.

1104
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,080
Like they're giving it to us.

1105
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,600
And so how do they do that?

1106
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,480
They can crash.

1107
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,160
Well, to me, that seems strange, but that's their idea.

1108
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,120
That it's a donation.

1109
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:22,800
Could this be, so you have to assess all of these different theories.

1110
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,320
Could this be a government PSYOP that I'm a part of and now, you know, sadly being duped,

1111
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,240
I'm a useful idiot, sadly being duped into saying this for people?

1112
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,360
Well, in my book, I say, I don't know, maybe, right?

1113
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,960
But I'm being really honest.

1114
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,520
In my book, American Cosmic, I'm still skeptical.

1115
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,840
I'm like, I'm not a believer or a disbeliever.

1116
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,640
But what happens afterwards makes me a complete believer

1117
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:50,800
that there's another level to this and that there are forces of evil and good here at work.

1118
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,280
Yeah.

1119
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,680
And so now I, that's what I believe.

1120
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,440
Maybe the angel's wives just didn't put any oil in the craft.

1121
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,320
Yeah, they let them drive it.

1122
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,320
Or maybe they just let their wives drive, their human wives drive.

1123
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,800
And that would be, that's the whole point.

1124
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,080
I think it's hard for people to think that this thing is an advanced piece of technology

1125
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,520
that doesn't have any fuel really.

1126
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,840
It's anti-gravity.

1127
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:19,600
It's going speeds we don't even know, 20,000 miles an hour, and then it just crashes.

1128
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,360
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

1129
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:26,000
And, but I think that's, it's like anything.

1130
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,080
It's just one miscalculation or one issue, or it's always associated with,

1131
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:37,760
someone said that we brought on a gentleman who was there in the 60s in the nuclear base.

1132
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:44,160
And there was this theory that our nuclear technology messes with their technology,

1133
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:50,160
can shut them off, can cause them to lose power almost, and then they crash.

1134
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,840
And if these things are nuclear and they're causing, you know,

1135
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:59,040
human beings to have almost radiation issues, then Robert Solace.

1136
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,760
Robert Solace.

1137
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,880
Oh yeah, Robert Solace.

1138
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,600
Yeah, yeah.

1139
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,960
And so if their nuclear and our nuclear issues cause their problems and they crash

1140
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,960
because of maybe some sort of bomb that we set off and in the atmosphere,

1141
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,520
and it caused them to lose power and then they go down.

1142
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,360
But also we're saying that they have sort of, you know.

1143
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,960
Well, I was going to ask about another idea with this.

1144
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,120
Not necessarily that they're crashed, but you said they're donated.

1145
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,080
And I wonder if any of your research, whether it be the oral tradition or talking to Tyler

1146
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,880
or some of this invisible college stuff,

1147
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:36,240
do, if you uncovered anything that would suggest that we have an agreement or an accord with some

1148
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:41,280
of these extraterrestrials, if you will, like, because people talk about the Eisenhower Accord.

1149
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,440
There's this idea that he went for emergency dental work and, but he didn't really do that.

1150
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,480
He went to Los Alamos and there was this, it was a donation.

1151
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,200
It's interesting.

1152
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,880
It's like that you donate something.

1153
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,760
Is it goodwill or do we have some kind of agreement?

1154
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:04,960
There's been hypothesized things on our show about the abduction phenomenon and that perhaps

1155
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,480
there's an agreement where there's a trade for technology.

1156
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,960
This is, of course, someone's opinion or their hypothesis that we've traded technology

1157
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,800
for permission to abduct humans.

1158
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,640
Yeah, if we have presidents met with aliens.

1159
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,400
Yeah, I know that one.

1160
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:20,720
I know that one.

1161
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,320
Have you found anything that would make you think that maybe that's happening or

1162
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,840
is that just sort of a lot of conjecture?

1163
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,080
I have not.

1164
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:33,760
I have not found anything to suggest that in terms of me talking to the people who are

1165
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,000
associated with those programs.

1166
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,640
Okay.

1167
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:46,000
Who actually maybe have seen the phenomena around nuclear sites and even weapons and

1168
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,800
stuff like that.

1169
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,440
Okay.

1170
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:55,040
What I do think, though, is that this is real about the nuclear power because, I mean,

1171
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,800
think of where the crash sites happen.

1172
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:02,640
They happen after the Manhattan Project over in where we're detonating.

1173
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,720
A lot in New Mexico, right?

1174
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,480
Yeah, so it's right there.

1175
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,280
And so there's something there that those...

1176
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,800
And the question I got a lot from Tyler was why do they care so much about our weapons

1177
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,520
of mass destruction?

1178
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,000
Exactly.

1179
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,160
They're always associated with them and they're turning them off.

1180
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:24,400
It kind of reminds me of those videos where the Chinese are shooting down those drones

1181
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,440
with those big guns because people can't illegally fly drones.

1182
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,120
It's like maybe our nukes just turn them off and then they just free fall and they're like,

1183
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,960
ah, and then they do crash.

1184
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,400
Something like that.

1185
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,360
Something we're doing is causing that and it's such a wild...

1186
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,280
Or it could just be ambivalence.

1187
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,880
I mean, it could be that...

1188
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,400
We had Gary Stearman, a gentleman on our show who has this UFO experience where

1189
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,040
his plane is going to go down.

1190
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:53,280
He's flying his plane and a UFO shows up on his wing and more or less saves him.

1191
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,400
Yeah.

1192
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,520
He has a time slippage, which is wild, but this dude's a Christian guy who does...

1193
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,080
Changed his entire life, but this UFO saved his plane.

1194
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:07,680
It basically took control and took it in and he landed in a situation where he shouldn't have...

1195
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,200
Yeah, he told that story on our show.

1196
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:09,760
He tells a story.

1197
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,240
So then you have these anecdotal things where you go...

1198
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,400
There's a lot of evil stuff that happens.

1199
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,480
I think the abduction phenomenon is super evil.

1200
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,720
We talk about demonic, it's evil.

1201
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:25,200
You have a lot of associations with UFOs as negative, quote, evil stuff,

1202
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,080
but then you also have this other side and Nate kind of touched on it where

1203
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,520
you have things that kind of don't make sense.

1204
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:32,800
They're helping.

1205
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,760
Or we go back to Francis of Assisi and you go...

1206
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,720
He got saved.

1207
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,560
Do you have an encounter with something that...

1208
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,000
Like you said, maybe it was a byproduct of the encounter was his injuries, but

1209
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,080
he's in prayer.

1210
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,680
Is this a positive...

1211
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,280
Like the good guys are also using technology.

1212
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:51,920
That's what I was going to say.

1213
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,080
Into that conversation is...

1214
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,400
When you were going through the archival stuff, and this I think fits the conversation as well,

1215
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,880
and you're seeing similar injuries, is that...

1216
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,320
We almost got there, but is that the same thing that Gary's seeing?

1217
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,360
Are we seeing...

1218
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:10,400
Are you able to look through and find these more ancient UFO encounters and say,

1219
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:17,840
we have a modern day reciprocal of that, and this feels a lot like someone having

1220
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:26,000
an encounter with technology, like a craft that's reported as an angelic or a seraph encounter,

1221
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,040
but it mimics the earmarks of someone having an encounter with radiation technology.

1222
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,360
Yeah, it could just be a different interpretation.

1223
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:33,840
Sure.

1224
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,120
The same phenomena.

1225
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:35,760
Right.

1226
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,680
I mean, it just seems so similar.

1227
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,440
I think you made a great point.

1228
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,560
Like we've got this...

1229
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,440
And we talked about this in the show.

1230
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:51,600
Sometimes we inherit this medieval understanding of angels and the super...

1231
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:57,280
We look at the work of Da Vinci and these things, and there's this chair, there's babies,

1232
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:05,120
and that becomes sort of our unconscious understanding of a very real realm, right?

1233
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:05,840
Yeah, it does.

1234
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,360
And so when you actually encounter that realm in real life...

1235
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,760
No, you're like, what the heck is that?

1236
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,840
Yeah, it doesn't make sense because you're expecting

1237
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:22,480
a winged thing, a thing with wings and halos to show up and a craft shows up instead.

1238
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,040
That's right.

1239
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,920
And Teresa of Avila had the same experience, and this was in the 1500s, okay?

1240
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:28,800
This is in Spain.

1241
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,240
And by the way, this gets redacted.

1242
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,320
So the Catholic Church redacts it because it doesn't fit into their theology.

1243
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,200
Tell us that story.

1244
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:46,000
Okay, so she is a nun, and a very intelligent woman can read and write and does all these

1245
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,200
amazing things.

1246
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:55,280
And she is just having a normal day when something shows up near her that's on her left side,

1247
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:00,720
and it's small, and it's about three feet tall, and it's all fiery and shiny.

1248
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,320
And she thinks in her head, because she actually writes about it herself.

1249
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,520
She gives her own report.

1250
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:10,720
She says, I think this might be an angel, but I've never seen an angel that looks like this.

1251
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,800
Another thing is that it is short.

1252
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,920
And another thing is that it has a dart.

1253
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,560
It has this dart that has fire at the end of it, okay?

1254
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,640
And then it actually examines her kind of like what you see in John Mack.

1255
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,280
It goes into her entrails, okay?

1256
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,600
And so she says, and it was a weird experience, she's ambivalent about it.

1257
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,000
She says it's both ecstatic and horrifying.

1258
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,960
So she says this, and she says it's real, it's not imagination.

1259
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,320
And later, Catholic redactors change it to this couldn't have happened because angels

1260
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,360
don't show up this way.

1261
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,320
So it's great that we have her own experience.

1262
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,240
And by the way, this is also like that.

1263
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:02,160
It's one of the most represented angel contact events in history.

1264
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:02,480
Really?

1265
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,920
Yeah, it's called Teresa of Avila's Ecstasy.

1266
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,520
And Bernini made a statue about it that paints that being like a cherub.

1267
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,240
Like a little child.

1268
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,640
Yeah, so we think that it's this cute little cherub thing.

1269
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,520
That comes from, by the way, Greek culture and Roman culture.

1270
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,800
That's Eros.

1271
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,440
Eros, yeah.

1272
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,640
Yeah, so that's a pre-Christian.

1273
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,400
They're borrowing imagery.

1274
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,600
Yeah, it's an image, yeah.

1275
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:30,240
How many different factions of these alien angels do you think there are?

1276
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,200
Because I mean, on our show, we've heard the insectolines,

1277
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,760
which look like these praying mantis things that are down on the ground.

1278
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,320
The greys.

1279
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,080
The greys, the talls and the short ones, three-foot ones, two-foot ones,

1280
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,240
and then the eight-foot ones that are supposedly...

1281
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:42,880
The Nordic.

1282
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,400
Someone saw that in Vegas.

1283
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,120
The Nordics, these tall, Palladian blonde ones.

1284
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,520
And then you have, you know, big-eyed version of the greys.

1285
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,440
And then angelic beings.

1286
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,240
You said seraph.

1287
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,360
Yeah, I mean, what are your thoughts on that?

1288
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,760
Because I think some people are just easy to lump it all into one.

1289
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,560
Aliens, wow, what?

1290
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,440
Just like an angel, what kind of angel?

1291
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,040
There's many different types of angels.

1292
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,080
Yeah, so there are taxonomy of angels, right?

1293
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:14,640
Sure.

1294
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,360
Okay, so medieval scholastics had this.

1295
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:22,560
And, you know, the thing is that they're kind of like mathematicians, right?

1296
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:26,080
Or scientists who are trying to understand quantum theory.

1297
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,680
Like they pose some...

1298
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,560
This is our theory now, and it changes with time because they approximate it.

1299
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,720
Because they're trying to get this model of reality,

1300
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,720
but they don't know the reality intimately.

1301
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,440
They can't say what it is, so they approximate it,

1302
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,040
and then they have this theory about it.

1303
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:47,200
I think that those taxonomies are theories about these beings.

1304
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,400
I'm still trying to wrap my head around the reality that they exist.

1305
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:55,680
And so for me to try to make a taxonomy, I'm not there.

1306
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,640
I can't do it.

1307
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,840
I can only accept that there are many different ones,

1308
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,200
because it appears that people talk about different ones,

1309
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,680
and there's so many of these stories.

1310
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:10,000
But I don't know how many.

1311
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,040
Yeah, I think we didn't even talk about the reptilians,

1312
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,120
which sounds like the UFO wreckage.

1313
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,600
Maybe the reptilian was flying around the frog-skinned one.

1314
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,280
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1315
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,360
That's what people have said to me.

1316
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,920
You keep saying that reptilian stuff, and I'm like, oh.

1317
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,720
People wrap their cars.

1318
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,080
You see the roads.

1319
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,480
Maybe the reptilians just wrap their UFOs and just cruise.

1320
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,920
I can't deny that that's what we found, right?

1321
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,720
But that is a wild story.

1322
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,600
You actually went there and picked up not many ufologists.

1323
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,880
I think that would be like the Bigfoot event

1324
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,480
for all the cryptic seekers.

1325
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,800
You picked up and you held UFO wreckage.

1326
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,160
That's what Tyler said to me.

1327
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,240
Tyler said, because I picked it up and looked at it,

1328
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,560
and Tyler was like, wow, your reaction is so odd.

1329
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,080
And I was like, odd.

1330
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,520
And he goes, don't you get it?

1331
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,720
This is historical.

1332
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,400
What you're holding is historical.

1333
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,040
Where is it now?

1334
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,320
I don't know.

1335
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:10,080
I think it's with Gary, but honestly, I don't know where he keeps it.

1336
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,640
I know that Stanford supports Gary, which is great.

1337
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,200
Supposedly the guy that we interviewed that had the wreckage

1338
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,080
went on a radio show, old school radio show,

1339
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,400
and then disappeared quickly after that.

1340
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:20,880
What?

1341
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:21,120
Yeah.

1342
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,240
They took him out.

1343
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,920
And there's pictures of this guy.

1344
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,080
He sent us photos of this Trapper, a government Trapper.

1345
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,040
He's sitting there by his government Trapper.

1346
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:27,840
Pretty robust gentleman.

1347
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,400
He went on a radio show and it's gone.

1348
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:30,880
He's gone.

1349
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,080
That was the backstory of that.

1350
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:40,320
I don't think that this is something that people want circulating in the population.

1351
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:42,800
I've got a question.

1352
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,640
Looking forward, your new book is Encounters,

1353
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,120
and you're talking about the cusp.

1354
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,000
In light of also what's happening today in the halls of Congress,

1355
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,120
what do you see happening next?

1356
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,960
Do you think that we have a disclosure or a contact event?

1357
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:05,040
Do you think this thing is going to slowly, even for show, leak out?

1358
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,040
Or what do you think happens next?

1359
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:10,560
Because you're really on the forefront of the research part of compiling

1360
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,560
everything that's happening.

1361
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,440
And we are really in a unique time.

1362
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,960
You held pieces of reported wreckage of a UFO.

1363
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,360
These things are the biggest things that's happened to

1364
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:29,840
humanity in the modern era, as far as our post-academic era.

1365
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,440
I think the idea of the interaction between angels and humans,

1366
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,760
you know, the testament was much more of a commonplace.

1367
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,840
I mean, not a commonplace, but just understood it wasn't weird.

1368
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:43,120
But we've kind of jumped the shark across the Rubicon, if you will.

1369
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,240
Or maybe we're still having them.

1370
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,160
We just don't write it down the same way.

1371
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:46,720
It could be.

1372
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,320
But what do you think happens next?

1373
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,040
The future?

1374
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,480
Yeah, like in the next whatever, next few years with all of this.

1375
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:56,000
Yeah.

1376
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,320
Okay.

1377
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:01,680
So just a quick anecdote about me writing this paper that's taken me two years to write.

1378
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:01,920
Okay.

1379
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:07,600
So it's an encyclopedia entry for Oxford Encyclopedia on, they named it, not me,

1380
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,080
they named it Aliens and UFOs.

1381
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:10,880
Okay.

1382
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,720
And it's, you know, how do you do that?

1383
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,280
So it's good.

1384
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:17,600
You know, those are usually small entries, but it's huge because I had to.

1385
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:23,760
I solicited the help of all these scientists who've been doing this for the last 40 years

1386
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,120
or more, and I cite them.

1387
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:27,440
Okay.

1388
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,480
So I want to give credit where credit should be due, right?

1389
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,440
To the whole history in the United States, at least, of this.

1390
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,400
I do try to include Australia and some other places too.

1391
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,240
So a lot of this is coming from the Invisible College.

1392
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:38,880
Yeah.

1393
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:45,120
Well, the thing is, is that so I write it and I send it in, and this is like two years ago almost,

1394
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,200
and it goes through peer review.

1395
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:53,280
And what happens is it goes to most likely members of like the Galileo project,

1396
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,120
those guys, right?

1397
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:01,360
And so they say that, or affiliated, not Avi Loeb himself, but affiliated with that.

1398
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,800
And they're physicists and astronomers, right?

1399
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,480
And they know this topic.

1400
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:12,720
But they told me not to use these names of several of the people that I named because

1401
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,200
those weren't credible scientists.

1402
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:22,400
Now I know for a fact that those scientists that they say are not credible have been

1403
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,960
paid by our government.

1404
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,520
They brief our government on this topic.

1405
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,240
So that shows you how behind academics are on this topic.

1406
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,360
They're paid experts for our government.

1407
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:33,760
Yeah.

1408
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:39,440
So how can these people who you may not know who they are, but their work is legit,

1409
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:45,200
and they actually work for your government, and they're paid experts on this topic.

1410
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,160
And I'm citing them.

1411
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,200
And so that was uncomfortable.

1412
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,520
That was an uncomfortable situation that I had to deal with.

1413
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,600
And it looks like it's going to be published.

1414
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,640
But I did have to rearrange some things.

1415
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,720
So that happens.

1416
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:06,640
So academia, sadly, is probably not at the forefront here of what's going to happen next.

1417
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:07,840
Yeah.

1418
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,400
From the beginning of our show, when we brought the Bigfoot scientist on,

1419
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,080
and he was kind of making it sound like if I wasn't a tenured professor,

1420
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,520
I would have been booted out of here because I was a laughing stock of the college.

1421
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,960
Other professors making fun of me and putting Bigfoot statues around and

1422
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,640
teasing me because of my work.

1423
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,120
But I mean, the idea is like, if your work is good, it's going to cause some controversy.

1424
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:29,760
That's true.

1425
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:30,240
That's true.

1426
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,400
That's what you have to embrace when you do this work.

1427
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,640
For someone who works in religious studies,

1428
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,600
because the way that information is disseminated now,

1429
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,840
do you think we'll have a disclosure event where our government will disclose?

1430
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,160
I don't necessarily think that's going to be the truth per se,

1431
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,240
because you talked about this oral narrative.

1432
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,520
So you really have these two things.

1433
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,600
You have what the public is fed or leaked or conditioned through Hollywood, et cetera,

1434
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,560
or what we're told gets out.

1435
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:02,080
And then you have this meta-narrative of what's actually happening.

1436
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:06,240
Do you think we reach a disclosure point where the government says, okay, got us?

1437
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,320
Kind of like an assamah bin Laden, like we got them.

1438
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,360
Then you talk to people behind the scenes and they're like, there's way more to this.

1439
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,200
Is it kind of one of those things?

1440
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,240
Yes, yes.

1441
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,920
So the thing is that the whistleblowers who are wonderful people

1442
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,200
and happy that they're doing that, they're always secondhand knowledge.

1443
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,760
I'm a person with firsthand knowledge.

1444
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:32,880
And so they're going to keep putting whistleblowers that are safe up there in Congress as a show.

1445
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,120
This is what people are going to accept.

1446
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,120
On the other hand, the people that actually do know something,

1447
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,200
they're going to use tactics that are harassing to try to get information from us.

1448
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,360
Thankfully, all my stuff is out there published.

1449
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,160
But I have had lots of people.

1450
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,280
You're like Bob Lazar.

1451
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,000
You're so public, it's safe in a way.

1452
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,280
I feel like Bob did that.

1453
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,880
He came out and I think his whole thing was

1454
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,520
if you hide in the public, in the center of the public eye,

1455
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,560
it's much harder to be disappeared than if you are, I don't know,

1456
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,600
anybody who just happens to know something and says something offhanded.

1457
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,080
It's a safe place to be as an academic.

1458
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,280
And then also, because everything is published, what are they going to do?

1459
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,840
There's not any secret knowledge in your head.

1460
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:14,800
That's right.

1461
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,840
We hope so, right?

1462
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,560
We all hope.

1463
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,120
Right. So yeah, so that's what I think.

1464
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,080
I don't think we're going to have that from the government.

1465
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,280
And I'm sorry to say that.

1466
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,400
I'm working with people who are working hard to do that.

1467
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,280
But honestly, I just don't think so.

1468
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:33,680
Just because we've had this since the 1950s and 60s.

1469
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,560
We've had these congressional type of hearings, right?

1470
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,520
Where credible witnesses come forward and talk.

1471
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:44,720
And even more so, well, we did have Ryan Graves, and he has

1472
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:51,920
seen and he has received so many reports from pilots.

1473
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,080
My friend, Dr. E.O. Whiteley, same thing.

1474
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,120
She's a pilot as well, trains pilots.

1475
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,560
So we do have these reports.

1476
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,080
They could get people up there to talk about the real thing.

1477
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,000
They really could, but they're not going to do it.

1478
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:04,800
They're not going to do it.

1479
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,680
It's stressful, too.

1480
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,440
Do you think that they've been communicating with us for a long time?

1481
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,440
It makes me think about the crop circle phenomena.

1482
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,280
And some of those are faked, but a lot of them aren't.

1483
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,680
And are they trying to say something to us, communicate to us in some sort of way?

1484
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:28,880
Yeah. So I think that consciousness is an access point.

1485
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,840
So I think that the early church, like look what happened to Francis.

1486
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,120
He's up there on the screen now.

1487
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,720
So here he is.

1488
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,200
He's trying to talk to angels.

1489
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:45,360
He's praying on a mountain and he's praying to God, right?

1490
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,800
And it's on the feast day of the archangels.

1491
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:56,080
So he's basically his mind or something in his consciousness is accessing this other realm.

1492
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,680
And they come, right?

1493
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,040
So I think that there is...

1494
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,600
Now, saying that, I think that you do not do this.

1495
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,440
You don't try to access it unless you just...

1496
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,080
Because there are bad ones.

1497
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,280
And I've seen this, too.

1498
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,720
So I've had so many people come to me, like thousands of people at this point,

1499
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,960
with information, no reports.

1500
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,960
And so most of them are really bad.

1501
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,000
Yeah. So don't do this in your life, right?

1502
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:30,080
So religious traditions have evolved constraints on how we access these realms.

1503
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,800
And listen to those.

1504
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,240
Those are the things we shouldn't throw out.

1505
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,800
We should be careful.

1506
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:44,720
And this is where I personally disagree with Joe Rogan and his ideas around psychedelics,

1507
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,440
because those experiences...

1508
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:52,080
He says it, and a lot of people in this space who are in the psychedelic space

1509
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,800
say that they're having encounters with real entities.

1510
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:01,600
But man, the people of faith that get there,

1511
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,200
they'll tell you quickly that there's like a false Jesus that walks around,

1512
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:08,320
that there are these entities that say these things and know these things about you.

1513
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:13,280
But it doesn't feel like we're supposed to do that.

1514
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,040
Yeah, I would say don't.

1515
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:20,080
Especially because I've had people come to me with knowledge of stuff they shouldn't know about me.

1516
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,120
And I know they were bad people, like I could tell.

1517
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:28,560
And so people don't have the discernment that the religious traditions suggest that you practice.

1518
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,400
Right. There's a way to access...

1519
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,520
We have the Holy Spirit.

1520
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,400
There's a way to access God, to pray to God.

1521
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,640
Jesus showed us that in the garden, how to pray.

1522
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,640
They asked some very simple question, which is a loaded question,

1523
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,640
but I think it's interesting.

1524
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,920
I just think this whole conversation as we...

1525
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,160
This is what Nate and I have been doing for four years,

1526
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,000
is trying to unpack angels in some ways.

1527
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,120
What are we actually talking about?

1528
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,040
There's a Greek word means messenger.

1529
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,640
Well, I was just going to say that.

1530
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,720
I mean, a messenger is a big part of the angels.

1531
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,560
I mean, it's their job to bring us messages.

1532
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:01,280
That's right.

1533
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:01,680
That's right.

1534
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:02,720
And I think they do.

1535
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,200
Yeah.

1536
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,640
And I think that that happens.

1537
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:10,000
I mean, it sounds like that person who's playing was saved, his life was saved.

1538
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,480
I would call that an angelic situation, right?

1539
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:18,320
But associating angels and UFOs, it's not a wild...

1540
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,160
Is that where you're at?

1541
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,440
Oh, there's a direct lineage, historical lineage.

1542
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:27,440
Because if you unpack what an angel actually looks like,

1543
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,280
that's imagery that we see and we've been brought up with.

1544
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,240
That's actually not even...

1545
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,640
That's pre-Christian imagery, right?

1546
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:40,160
So that's imagery that domesticates the event, the angel contact event.

1547
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,520
And generally even like, look at Mary, be not afraid.

1548
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,400
This is repeated over and over again in the Bible for a reason,

1549
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,280
because it's scary.

1550
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,560
It's a scary event.

1551
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,760
And when it comes, when you don't ask for it and it comes,

1552
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:56,240
and it imparts knowledge that you need from, you know, God is sending a messenger.

1553
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,560
I believe that that's true.

1554
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,080
I believe that that's good, okay?

1555
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:05,760
But I think that allow that to happen.

1556
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:06,400
Don't...

1557
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,240
Don't look for it or summon it, right?

1558
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,440
Or whatever they try to...

1559
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,240
Yeah, I think so.

1560
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:10,960
That's my...

1561
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:15,520
I mean, I could change my mind, but after what I've experienced, I don't think I...

1562
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,760
Yeah, careful what you pray for sometimes.

1563
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,520
You have to have that humility factor.

1564
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,200
I think a lot of people don't.

1565
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,000
They go looking for it.

1566
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
And especially with these people trying to contact aliens,

1567
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,400
they're just out there on the shining lasers into the sky.

1568
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,840
They're like, come down and hang out with us.

1569
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,400
It's like Independence Day, the beginning of Independence Day, where they're like...

1570
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,280
I saw that, yeah, yeah.

1571
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,000
They're like, I'll dance on the top and then they're like, boom.

1572
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,920
And then it's like, see ya.

1573
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:40,000
But yeah, I think that it is a terrifying event and you have to think about,

1574
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,240
there's probably a lot of things going on in that event that not just a being standing there,

1575
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,880
but maybe there's an entourage of weird stuff that they've brought with them.

1576
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,480
And you're looking into...

1577
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:57,200
And a lot of people who are seers on our show, too, often will say some bizarre stuff and

1578
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,320
see bizarre stuff.

1579
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:04,720
And it's hard as podcasters and hosts to know, okay, are you seeing good things?

1580
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,320
Are you seeing bad things?

1581
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,840
Are they manipulating your perception?

1582
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,360
Are they presenting you a false light?

1583
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:09,920
I don't know.

1584
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:16,000
Like, how are we supposed to make sense of these encounters?

1585
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,560
I think that's why the Bible forbids a lot of these things.

1586
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,080
I think so, to keep us safe.

1587
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:27,600
Because if consciousness is an access point, it's very important to keep it sovereign.

1588
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,560
I mean, just talking to the dead, you're not supposed to do it.

1589
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,840
It's not that you can't, shouldn't, because you don't know.

1590
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,600
Back to the medium, back to the medium talk.

1591
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,400
It's pretty specific, you don't do that.

1592
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,800
I guess one of my last questions is now,

1593
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:45,360
if you had a conversation with yourself 12 years ago before you got into this,

1594
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:46,880
how would that go?

1595
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,560
I know that's impossible to do, but I'm just trying to think of like,

1596
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,400
where you are now versus where you were.

1597
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,680
Would you look at yourself and be like, you are nuts.

1598
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:01,360
You're out of your mind, or is there a part of you that this truth,

1599
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:06,560
this understanding, you've always wanted to know the truth.

1600
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,680
It didn't matter what it was.

1601
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,520
I had a conversion experience at 11.

1602
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,960
So I still have that Bible that I made my mother buy me after that.

1603
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,200
It's the King James Version, red letter edition.

1604
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,760
Still have that.

1605
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:20,640
That's cool, keep it.

1606
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:26,720
And so I asked God, and it wasn't then, it was in my 20s.

1607
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,320
I said, God, I really want to know.

1608
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,120
And then I went through training to learn about the Bible and everything like that.

1609
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:39,440
And I think that what I would say to myself in 2012,

1610
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,560
I know what my 2012 self would say to me now.

1611
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,880
I would say, are you crazy?

1612
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,960
Why did you do that?

1613
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,880
But looking back, I thank God, really.

1614
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:53,840
I thank God for it.

1615
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,320
And I also, because God has showed me, right?

1616
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,880
And it was shocking, frankly.

1617
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,520
And I would say, Diana of the past, it's going to be okay.

1618
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,080
You're going to go out of your comfort zone and it's going to be hard.

1619
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:09,600
And be okay with that.

1620
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,480
Because in the end, today, you'll get a break.

1621
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,440
You'll get a break.

1622
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,160
Yeah.

1623
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:16,800
I mean, that's cool.

1624
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,800
I mean, you start this journey and then you actually get to hold UFO wreckage.

1625
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,240
And not many people get to do that.

1626
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:28,160
And early on, it probably might have been a little more of a mine grenade now, maybe.

1627
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:28,800
Yeah, yeah.

1628
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,320
I mean, at the time, I was...

1629
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,000
But I think it's great, though, because it's so organic.

1630
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,680
Because you are so skeptical.

1631
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:38,240
You're not out looking for this in a sense, like chasing this down.

1632
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,120
It kind of comes to you.

1633
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,040
And you go and you go, I don't know.

1634
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,760
And then you're holding it and you go, maybe there's something to this.

1635
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,400
I think that's incredible.

1636
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,200
Yeah, it is.

1637
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:51,200
I mean, because you just don't get those opportunities.

1638
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,640
It feels like something that God would do.

1639
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:56,800
Because I think that there are so many truth seekers that are just desperately willing

1640
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:02,480
to sell their soul to see a Bigfoot or to get on a UFO craft, even if it's a terrible experience.

1641
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:06,880
They just want the tangible experience, but then it just kind of presents itself to you.

1642
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,800
And I think that's important.

1643
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:13,440
And I just appreciate you being willing to share with our listeners that.

1644
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:17,840
Because we find ourselves in a weird intersect between skeptics and believers.

1645
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,400
And I think over the years, we've grown.

1646
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,040
Before this show started, I was more in the Bigfoot space.

1647
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:28,560
And now I'm like, there's a whole other world of blurry creatures in the skies, not just in the woods.

1648
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,480
Also, I appreciate your work.

1649
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:37,840
Because I think it's so important as Christians that we create a framework to contextualize this.

1650
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:43,520
Because I do think that things that are this out of the box or that seem this far out of the box

1651
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:48,400
of mainstream church have the potential to derail people from their faith.

1652
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,120
And I think that's why I think your work is so important.

1653
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:56,400
Because of where you sit and what you do, and because you are a professor of religion,

1654
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,760
looking at this provides framework within our faith.

1655
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,800
Say, our faith is big enough.

1656
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,560
Let's just look back in the past and we can go St. Francis of Assisi.

1657
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,680
And this weird looks like an abduction thing to happen.

1658
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:08,800
All these things are written down.

1659
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,640
And then we have the Bible.

1660
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:14,320
We can talk about Jacob and we can talk about Abraham and the angel of the Lord doing these things.

1661
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,560
Walking, talking, eating, wrestling.

1662
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:21,680
And perhaps, not even more perhaps, but we believe in this space that this is

1663
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,240
these are some of the most important conversations to have.

1664
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:29,200
What's happening today in the halls of Congress, I think, without context for Christians,

1665
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,600
could be something that's just like, this disqualifies my faith.

1666
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,560
Yes, exactly.

1667
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,080
I think that's what a lot of people say.

1668
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:38,080
And a lot of people from the government are trying to get me to say that.

1669
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:42,240
Say that this is going to make people who are religious, non-religious.

1670
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,520
And I'm like, no, it's not going to.

1671
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,560
It's going to do the opposite.

1672
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,720
Because look what happened to me.

1673
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,000
Just last thing.

1674
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:53,360
The thing that Francis did right was the towel cross to Brother Leo.

1675
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,560
Convert now.

1676
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:55,760
That's what it definitely said.

1677
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,480
Convert now?

1678
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,760
Convert now.

1679
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:58,240
That's right.

1680
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,200
Everyone out there, convert now if you're listening to this.

1681
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,720
Yeah, we'd love to tell our listeners where your books are, where to interact with you.

1682
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:05,200
Oh, sure.

1683
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:08,000
Yeah, I have a website, dwpasulka.com.

1684
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:14,560
And I also am on DWpasulka at Twitter and Instagram at this moment.

1685
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,600
I think on LinkedIn too.

1686
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,080
And on Amazon.

1687
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,680
My books are on Amazon.

1688
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,160
Awesome.

1689
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:22,800
Luke's going to send you his first reggae Christian band.

1690
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,680
Oh, yeah, exactly.

1691
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,400
With the hit song, I Saw the Seraph.

1692
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:26,880
That's right.

1693
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:30,080
I'm going to try that joke second time, see if it plays.

1694
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:34,800
Yeah, new books, encounters, experiences with non-human intelligences.

1695
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,440
Very cool.

1696
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,480
And for all our audio listeners, you can see all this stuff on our YouTube channel

1697
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,760
on the full video now.

1698
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,840
So I appreciate you coming into the studio.

1699
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,520
Yeah, so happy to be here.

1700
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,720
It's such a great studio.

1701
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,680
Yeah, we're having fun and hope you enjoy your time in Nashville.

1702
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:48,880
And thanks for being so great.

1703
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,320
We loved all our experiences with you.

1704
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,360
Yeah, you've just been amazing for showing up being here with us.

1705
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:59,120
We'll have to do another one because I feel like there's so much more information here,

1706
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,160
so many questions I want to ask.

1707
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,440
I'm going to get into AI and things.

1708
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,040
But we'd love to have you at our conference also next year.

1709
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:05,680
Love to come.

1710
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,480
Love, Tennessee.

1711
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,520
Oh, come on, man.

1712
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,400
Well, thanks, Diana.

1713
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,280
All right, thank you.

1714
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,560
Thank you.
