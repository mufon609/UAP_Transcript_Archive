1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back, UFOs. Are they real? We're talking with John Lear on the subject.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Previously on the UFO Reporter...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The most commonly described alien is about three and a half feet tall, has a round head, arms reaching to or below his knees, and is wearing a silvery space suit or coveralls.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Our guest on this particular day cancelled. Who could we get to fill this? I called up John Lear. I said, you said you had a guy who was going to work out there and maybe work on flying saucers in the desert. Can we talk to him?

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, there's several, actually nine, flying saucers, flying disks.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't even know his name. He used a suit on him and out the story comes.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That are out there of extraterrestrial origin.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I get pulled off the set, the general manager comes back, what the hell was that? Is this for real? What did you just do?

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
His real name is Robert Lazar. He says he earned degrees in physics and electronics, but the schools we contacted say they've never heard of him.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, they're trying to make me a non-person.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And tonight, George digs deeper, searching for the truth.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Did you knowingly lie?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I am telling the truth. I've tried to prove that.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Look, I don't know if it's real, but I'm going to find out.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The Area 51 whistleblower comes under fire.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We've got threatening phone calls. He'll never make it back here.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And George gets the attention of the U.S. government.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We were following.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So they were definitely listening to you.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They were listening to my phone.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Along with two secret allies, all paving the way for an unprecedented twist inside the halls of the U.S. Capitol.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A multi-decade crash retrieval and reverse engineering program.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, this is serious. It's been serious for a long time and it's been ignored for way too long.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The keepers of the secrets are better at their job than people like us are at ours, and they're not going to let this thing go easily.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
For over 30 years, investigative journalist George Knapp has fearlessly taken on the biggest mysteries, crimes and scandals.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Tonight we examine a few additional UFO cases.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
From the Las Vegas mob.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The murder of Alan Dorfman was never solved, nor was the bombing of Frank Rosenthal's car.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
To strange phenomena in the sky.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There is some kind of a phenomenon here that can't just be written off.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Covering it all just the same.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I've always approached it as a news story.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's not my religion.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's not a belief.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't know what to believe even now.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now News Nation is bringing you unprecedented access to his archives the date back decades and how his life's work still influences the conversation on UFOs to this day.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
36 years later, I'm still trying to figure it out.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I was so cocky in the beginning.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, this field is a mess.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is just, you know, 95% of this stuff is nonsense and it's explainable.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's prosaic.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And I figured, well, look, I mean, what this topic needs is a good reporter.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll have this all whipped into shape in six months.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Of course, I was ridiculously optimistic.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Six months turned into a 36 year Las Vegas career for investigative reporter George Knapp.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Did you have any interesting meetings with anyone UFO related around here?

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Do you go to any certain restaurants or?

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
All of them.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I mean, the pepper mill where we grabbed lunch.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That was like my office annex.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I would meet all kinds of people from Area 51 there.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
George helped reveal the very existence of Area 51 through his interviews with Bob Lazar.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Tonight we're going to delve a little deeper into the subject with the man who was the impetus for our reports in the first place, Bob Lazar.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Bob, good to have you here.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
A thumbnail sketch of yourself for those who might not be familiar with your background.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Lazar was a young scientist who claimed to work at the secret base called Area 51 near Groom Lake in an especially hidden area called S4,

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
where Lazar claimed crashed UFOs were stored.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Actually nine flying saucers, flying disks.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This came from somewhere else.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I mean, as bizarre as that is to believe, but I mean, it's there.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I saw it.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I know what the current state of the art is in physics and it can't be done.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is one of George's reports from 1989 about what exactly Lazar says he saw.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
According to Lazar, his employer was the United States Navy.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He says he and other government employees would gather near EG&G, fly to Groom Lake,

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and then a very few people would get into a bus with blacked out or no windows and drive to S4.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When you get off the bus, what do you see?

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's a very interesting building.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's got a slope of probably about 30 degrees, which are hanger doors, and it has textured paint on it, but it looks like sand.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's made to look like the side of the mountain that it's in, whether it's to disguise it from satellite photographs or what.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He says he was never told exactly what he'd be working on, but figured it had something to do with advanced propulsion.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
On his first day, he was told to read a series of briefings and immediately realized how advanced the propulsion was.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The power source is an antimatter reactor.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They run gravity amplifiers.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
There's actually two parts to the drive mechanism.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's a bizarre technology.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
There's no physical hookup between any of the systems in there.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
They use gravity as a wave using waveguides, almost like microwaves.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It took a while, Lazar says, before he actually saw one of the flying disks.

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
However, there were hints everywhere.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Right, they had a poster, and it looked like a commercial poster almost, like it was lithographed and you could buy it at a Kmart or something,

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:44,000
but they were all over the place, and it had the disk that I coined the term the sport model was lifted off the ground about three feet at area S4 on the dry lake there,

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and the catch on the bottom said they were here, and those are just all over the place.

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Later, he got to see the real thing.

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
When I was let in, it was the first time I saw the sport model in the hangar, sitting down,

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and I was told they could have walked me in the front door, but they purposely wanted to walk me by it.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I was told not to say anything and just keep my eyes forward and walk past the disk into the office area, and I did,

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and as we went by it, I just kind of stuck my hands on it just to run it alongside the thing, and that was about the smallest time.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
After that, I got to see it actually lift off the ground and operate.

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But you also, in between that, you saw more than one.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah, the hangars are all connected together, and there are large bay doors between each one,

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and there were nine total that I saw, each one being different, like they had the assortment pack.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
One of the nine flying disks he says he saw at the base, which was designated S4, looks exactly like this UFO photographed in Europe.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Lazar called it the sport model.

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I gave everything simple names. There's the top hat one and the jello mold.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The sport model operated without any hitches at all. I mean, it looked new, if I know what a new flying saucer looks like.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
One of them looked like it was hit with some sort of projectile.

98
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Even before he saw the sport model operate, Lazar says, he suspected that the ship came from somewhere else.

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The realization slapped him in the face the first time he glimpsed the inside of the disk.

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I got to look inside, and it had really small chairs, and I think that was the first confirmation I had.

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That was just a shocking thing, because every time before that, I was able to label it,

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
well, this is just a little advance that a group of scientists had formed, and they're keeping it secret.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And yeah, we could have built a big disk like that. That's no problem.

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We could have adapted these to make it fly, but why does it have little furniture inside, essentially little seats?

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And things began to click together just all too fast.

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
A few of the disks had been completely dismantled to find out how they worked, Lazar says, but others were fully operational.

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The bottom of it glowed blue and began to hiss like high voltage does on a round sphere.

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's my impression that the reason that they're round and have no sharp edges is to contain the high voltage,

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
like if you've seen on high voltage systems, insulators, things are round or else you get a corona discharge.

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
In either case, it began to hiss as in high voltage, and it lifted off the ground quietly,

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
except with that little hiss in the background, the net stopped as soon as it reached about 20, 30 feet.

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Lazar's interview with George got attention far beyond Las Vegas.

113
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Suddenly people around the world were paying attention to it.

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There was something called Paranet that was transcribing every piece as it aired,

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and then they send it all over the world via this fledgling technology called the internet.

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There were people dubbing it off and then showing it in movie theaters and charging admission to it.

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We got inquiries from all over the world, other media everywhere.

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
When that Lazar part of the story broke in episode five, six, and seven, man, it went to a different level.

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Lazar was credible enough for the Nippon TV network.

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Nippon devoted two hours of prime time to a special on Lazar and UFOs in March.

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Lazar was invited to go to Japan to interview with reporters there, but along with all the attention came disturbing threats.

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The day we were supposed to go, I had tickets in hand, even went down and bought yen down at the currency exchange.

123
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You know, we got threatening phone calls, I mean, that basically said, you'll never make it back here.

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So we really sat down and just thought, how important really is the interview? And we didn't go.

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Lazar told George that security was tight and that fear and intimidation was used as a brainwashing tool.

126
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I did everything but physically hurt me.

127
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Put a gun to your head?

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah.

129
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And said what? Actually put a gun to your head?

130
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Well, they did that even in the original security briefings.

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They had guards there with M16s, guys slamming their finger into my chest, screaming in my ear, some people pointing weapons at me.

132
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Like I said, it's not a good place to work.

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
When you came out with the series and then the special, was there a pushback?

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah. Well, there was. And during the making, there was pushback.

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We were followed. Me, Lazar, a couple of others of us.

136
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I know it's hard to believe that, that they would go to that trouble, but they knew I was working with him.

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
They knew what I was digging into.

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They would go to his house when he wasn't there, open up the doors and windows, write stuff on his blackboard, move things around just to mess with his head.

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He went to the gym one time with a friend of his. He was really getting kind of panicky about the whole thing.

140
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He has a gun. He had an Uzi in his car for self-protection.

141
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He goes into the gym, has a workout, comes out an hour later.

142
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The doors of the car are open. The windows are rolled down.

143
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The Uzi, which had been in a glove box, was there sitting on the front seat.

144
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They were just letting them know that they're watching.

145
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Coming up, threats and also questions about whether Bob Lazar was telling the truth about what he saw at Area 51.

146
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Did you knowingly lie when you said you had actually seen anti-gravity propulsion in operation?

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
No.

148
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The results of several lie detector tests.

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I am telling the truth. I've tried to prove that.

150
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Plus...

151
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
As soon as they talked to me, they got visited the next day by people proclaiming to be government agents.

152
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
More sources coming forward as the government ramps up their intimidation tactics when we come back.

153
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They had guards there with M16s.

154
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
A guy is slamming their finger into my chest, screaming in my ear.

155
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Some people are pointing weapons at me.

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Like I said, it's not a good place to work.

157
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It was one of the standout scoops for famed UFO reporter George Knapp.

158
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
His interviews with Bob Lazar, a young scientist,

159
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
who was a member of the U.S. Air Force,

160
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
who was a member of the U.S. Air Force,

161
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
who was a member of the U.S. Air Force,

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
who claimed to have worked at Area 51.

163
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But was Bob Lazar telling the truth?

164
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
George put him to the test in a series of reports.

165
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Lazar agreed to undergo a polygraph exam as part of this report.

166
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Polygrapher Ron Slay asked about the technology Lazar had seen.

167
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Did you knowingly lie when you said you had actually seen anti-gravity propulsion in operation?

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No.

169
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The results of this exam were inconclusive.

170
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Lazar appeared to be truthful on one test, deceitful on a second.

171
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Slay recommended that a second examiner be brought in.

172
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Polygrapher Terry Tavernetti runs a corporate security operation

173
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and is a former Los Angeles police officer.

174
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He put Lazar through four tests and concluded there was no attempt to deceive.

175
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And I left there thinking that I feel we do have some credibility to what the subject had to say.

176
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And that's when I went to some of my colleagues.

177
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Tavernetti sent the test results to a third polygrapher who agreed the results appeared truthful.

178
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The charts were then sent to a fourth examiner who did not agree,

179
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
suggesting Lazar might be relating information he'd learned from someone else.

180
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The polygraphers conferred and decided they would not issue a final statement on truthfulness

181
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
until more specific testing can be conducted.

182
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And that's where it stands.

183
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Tavernetti believes that difficulty in determining Lazar's truthfulness

184
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
stems from the fear that was drilled into him.

185
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think we're talking about a subject here that is so far-reaching and it is so emotional.

186
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And when you're dealing with emotions, this is polygraph,

187
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
because in polygraph you're looking at fear,

188
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
the fear of getting caught telling a lie because something bad will happen to you if you do.

189
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Well, I am telling the truth.

190
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I've tried to prove that.

191
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What's going on up there could be the most important event in history.

192
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You're talking about contact, physical contact and proof from another system,

193
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
another planet, another intelligence.

194
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That's got to be the biggest event in history, period.

195
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And it's real.

196
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And it's real and it's there.

197
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And I had an extremely small part in it,

198
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
but I'm convinced that what I saw is absolute proof of that.

199
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
There is no way we could have created those systems.

200
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There's no way we could have made the disks, the power supplies, anything to go with them.

201
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You believe his story, don't you?

202
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, I do.

203
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah, I've got to know him pretty well over the last couple of months,

204
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and I believe he's telling the truth.

205
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
George's connection to Bob Lazar led other tipsters to start calling him,

206
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
but again there was intimidation that made his quest to learn more increasingly difficult.

207
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I had people call me during those projects, those first two,

208
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
who offered to give me information about reverse engineering, flying saucers.

209
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Six of them right in a row were visited.

210
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
As soon as they talked to me, they got visited the next day

211
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
by people proclaiming to be government agents who told them, shut the hell up.

212
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Even one of the polygraph examiners, former police officer Terry Tabernetti,

213
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
says shortly after his involvement with Lazar was made public, his employers were contacted.

214
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The corporate officers where I'm employed received a telephone call from a government agency

215
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
wanting to know why I was getting involved in something that I shouldn't be.

216
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And I asked, well, at what agency? What was said? Did they identify themselves?

217
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And I said, because I'll be more than happy to talk to them.

218
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And I was refused this information, told that he didn't know, meaning my boss.

219
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Tabernetti says his house was also burglarized around the time he did Lazar's polygraph.

220
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
As an investigator of over 20 years, I don't believe in coincidences.

221
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There's a reason for everything. I mean, could it have been a random residential burglary? Yes.

222
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
One case, the source was a cop. He worked at the courthouse,

223
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and she worked at the courthouse as a court reporter.

224
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And he said, she told me one time over lunch that she had worked for a defense contractor

225
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and heard this information about Roswell and wreckage and bodies

226
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and it being stored out in the Nevada desert.

227
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I asked this cop friend, would she talk to me? He goes, I think so. Here's her number.

228
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I called her and she gave me the broad strokes of her story.

229
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I said, can we meet? If I need to hide your face or your identity, change your name, I will.

230
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The very next day she gets visited by these two guys.

231
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
They told her, you know, you're still subject to your security clearance.

232
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And then they go, we know your daughter lives in LA

233
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and that you travel across the desert to see her and she comes to see you.

234
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's a big desert out there. It'd be a shame if something happened to either one of you.

235
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
This is a veiled threat, not so veiled threat.

236
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
She was scared to death. Not only wouldn't talk to me,

237
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I called her 10 years later after she had left that job and she still wouldn't talk to me.

238
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So they were definitely listening to you. They were listening to my phone.

239
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And it really pissed me off. I mean, they couldn't have obtained a warrant to do it.

240
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No judge in Nevada would approve something like that.

241
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They wanted to know who was offering to give me information.

242
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And it really made me mad. Again, I was already sort of on a crusade

243
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
because of the FOIA documents, the paper trail and the lies.

244
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This really got under my skin.

245
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And so we produced another nine-part series in May of 1990 and it hit even harder.

246
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And that sort of sealed the deal for me.

247
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It made me the UFO reporter, whether I like it or not.

248
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Coming up next, the UFO reporter was about to get two of his best sources.

249
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I've been interested in the subject for a long time.

250
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You've said you don't think it's little green men. Is it possible that nobody really,

251
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
there's no one who knows the ultimate answer?

252
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't think no one has the answer.

253
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm anxious to get the facts. I think it's something we should look into.

254
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
U.S. Senator and a rich American businessman take George's UFO reporting to places he never imagined.

255
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It was George Knapp's bombshell 1989 interview with young scientist Bob Lazar

256
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
that opened the door to new UFO sources.

257
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Two really important things had happened in association with that project.

258
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
One was Harry Reid.

259
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Nevada Senator Harry Reid saw George's UFO series and was interested.

260
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You know, George Knapp, he was a great guy.

261
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
He was a great guy.

262
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Nevada Senator Harry Reid saw George's UFO series and was interested.

263
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You know, George, I'll have to look at this. I have heard about this exact story.

264
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I've heard about it as kind of a preview of your program.

265
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I visited with you once before. I'm anxious to get the facts.

266
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I think it's something we should look into.

267
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He says, yeah, well, I'm going back to Washington. My car will pick you up.

268
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You can talk to me on the way to the airport.

269
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And so I spilled the beans to him what I'd learned so far.

270
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
He didn't kick me out of his car. He was interested.

271
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He was interested. He said at the end, well, look, keep me in the loop and I'll do the same for you.

272
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And that friendship that sort of started there, the secret conversation started that day.

273
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It lasted for the rest of his life and had a major effect on my life.

274
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Senator Reid visited Area 51 several times over the years,

275
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
but never commented to George on the record about what he saw.

276
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I had never wanted to ask you on the record because I know there are limits on what you can say,

277
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
but you've been there multiple times.

278
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Quite a few times, and that was something that was really necessary,

279
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
especially with the Soviets, with their satellites.

280
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You know, today I see things that were experimental up there that are now everyday deals.

281
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Were there a lot of off-the-record conversations, documents he would give you that you weren't reporting on?

282
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
For years and years and years. It would ebb and flow at different times,

283
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
depending on what else I was working on.

284
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'd go to Washington, if not every year or every other year,

285
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
to interview our congressional delegation and always made a point to spend time with them.

286
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And he'd always pull me aside and we'd have our own little UFO conversation out of ear reach of his staff.

287
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Drove them crazy. Drove them crazy for years because neither one of us would tell them what it was about.

288
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Now, after a while, they figured it out.

289
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And George, as you know, I became terribly interested in this.

290
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And rather than think about it, I said, why don't we do something about it?

291
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
In 2007, Reid and other senators authorized the Black Budget Study of UFOs,

292
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
OSAP, which stands for Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Application Program.

293
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
A contract for the program was awarded to a company called Bass,

294
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
an offshoot of Bigelow Aerospace, owned by Las Vegas space entrepreneur Robert Bigelow,

295
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
a billionaire who had funded his own UFO studies for years.

296
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Bigelow first connected with George after his initial UFO reports in the late 80s.

297
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I started getting all these calls. One of them came from this businessman I'd never heard of.

298
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Hold for Robert Bigelow. OK. He gets on there. Boy, that was really good.

299
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He kind of introduces himself. I had no idea that he had already been funding UFO research.

300
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He offered to help. He wanted to give me money to go ahead and pursue the investigation.

301
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I said, no, no, no, can't do that. I'm working for Channel 8.

302
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But I appreciate your offer of support and maybe we can get in touch.

303
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That friendship that I developed with Bigelow then proved so important in the long run.

304
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And eventually Reid and Bigelow got together and I introduced him.

305
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
George reported on every step of the new project.

306
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Bigelow built secure facilities inside his aerospace company.

307
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
At its peak, the study had 46 scientists working at the Nevada facility,

308
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
writing reports and analyzing data that came in from the military.

309
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Rapid response teams were dispatched to the scene of UFO events.

310
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Over the five years, the project cost a total of $22 million.

311
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So you knew that the U.S. government was funding a secret program and you just had to stay quiet?

312
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah. They asked me to be part of it.

313
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I was asked twice to get a security clearance so that they could bring me in and show me stuff.

314
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I was not privy to everything that was going on.

315
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I did not have a security clearance, so I'd get bits and pieces, big picture stuff about what they were doing.

316
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And most of what they did was not classified, but it was very restricted.

317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You know, it was kept in a stowpipe.

318
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And during the five years of research, Robert Bigelow's team made an unexpected finding,

319
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
details of a UFO resembling a tic-tac off the west coast of the United States.

320
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Over a two-week period in late 2004, an unknown 45-foot-long tic-tac-shaped object

321
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
played cat and mouse with the U.S. Navy off the coast of California.

322
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Even before a bombshell New York Times story on the tic-tac, George knew about it.

323
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and its support ships,

324
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
carrying the most sophisticated sensor systems in the world,

325
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
repeatedly detected recurring glimpses of the tic-tac but were unable to lock on.

326
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
On November 14th, F-18s were ordered into the area and saw it up close.

327
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Veteran pilot Dave Fravor, commander of the elite Black Aces unit,

328
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
says the tic-tac reacted to the presence of the F-18s,

329
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
then took off like a bullet fired from a gun.

330
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
If you go from what I saw, which is very close to what Bob describes, that would change mankind.

331
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's one of the reasons why you believe what you saw in 2004 was not ours.

332
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yeah, like I said last night, I think a lot of it was, if you had asked me in 2004, I didn't know.

333
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
My thing is, it's now almost 15 years later and that technology is still,

334
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
no one has figured it out or no one has seen it.

335
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You can hide stuff, you can hide stuff for a long time,

336
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
but hiding stuff for 15 years, I think it gets harder and harder and harder.

337
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Something that revolutionary.

338
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yes, I mean, that's literally it.

339
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Why would you hide a huge technology leap for mankind if you haven't?

340
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
OSAP had created the world's largest UFO database, 200,000 cases, a data warehouse or what it was.

341
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
They put together an amazing pile of work in a short period of time.

342
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
A stack of documents, if you printed out the pages, would be taller than either of us.

343
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
In-depth reports about different topics.

344
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The tic-tac, there's an investigation, an explanation of the tic-tac

345
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
that is so much more advanced than anything that anyone has seen.

346
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Congress has not seen one page of that stuff.

347
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The public hasn't seen one page of it.

348
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Where is it all?

349
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Good question.

350
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I don't think the DIA can find it.

351
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You know, we've seen these reports and documents that we've obtained and photos

352
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
and information from the Navy about these drones buzzing their ships

353
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and they don't know where they came from.

354
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
They can't track them.

355
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
They're coming in swarms, swarms like bees, like insects.

356
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I don't know if it's scarier that it's an unknown

357
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
or if it's scarier that our adversaries have made great strides in technology.

358
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And always remember, Russia, former Soviet Union, is run by a man who ran the KGB.

359
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
They had the KGB.

360
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The Soviet Union is run by a man who ran the KGB.

361
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
They had as many as 30,000 agents at one time, KGB agents.

362
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So Russia's involved in this, no question about it.

363
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Coming up, George travels 6,000 miles from Vegas to Moscow.

364
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
There was a period of 78 to 88 where the Russians had had these dramatic UFO incidents.

365
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Did you hear what he came back with?

366
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Plus, never before heard parts of our exclusive interview with UFO whistleblower David Grush.

367
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
As George Knapp started to become synonymous with UFO reporting,

368
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
he started to look outside the U.S., specifically at Russia.

369
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So there comes this high-level Russian scientist to Las Vegas.

370
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
We have a couple of beers to ask him about UFOs.

371
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You ever hear anything about it?

372
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
He goes, no, don't think so.

373
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Doesn't ring a bell.

374
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
We have one more beer.

375
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
He goes, you know, now that you mention it.

376
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
There's a friend of mine at KGB who said he had worked on a report about UFOs and some documents.

377
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I could ask him about it.

378
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I said, you think there's anybody else who might know in the Ministry of Defense?

379
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Well, I know all those guys who could find out.

380
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So he said, yeah, I'll do it.

381
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Behind the scenes, George planned a high-stakes trip in 1993 with Russia in turmoil and sources ready to talk.

382
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
We're there 10 days.

383
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
We were pulled over by cops seven times.

384
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
There were people stationed outside of our rooms at the hotel.

385
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I would put little traps to see if they went through my stuff, which they did every single day.

386
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,000
We met with this guy, Boris Sokolov, who had been the head of what was then the largest UFO investigation

387
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
conducted by a government in the history of the world.

388
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
There was a period of 78 to 88 where the Russians had had these dramatic UFO incidents,

389
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and they decided to create a program to get to the bottom of it.

390
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And man, well, that was really something.

391
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I won't explain exactly how I got access to the files, but I did.

392
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Thousands of pages from the Russian Ministry of Defense.

393
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Many of those pages were classified at the time.

394
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So then we had the problem of how to get it out.

395
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Well, I thought I was going to ask.

396
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It was pretty tricky.

397
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
What did you do?

398
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Well, these documents, in those days at least,

399
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
the Russian Ministry of Defense would stamp classification on the top page of the document,

400
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and the rest of them weren't marked at all.

401
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It was clear they were military documents, but without that classification,

402
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
it's a lot less onerous and dangerous.

403
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I just removed the top pages of all those documents,

404
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and I threw the rest of it in my suitcase with some caviar, by the way,

405
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
which they told us we were not allowed to take out caviar.

406
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So I threw some caviar in there as a diversion,

407
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
and it worked because they opened it up there.

408
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Look, hey, caviar, not allowed.

409
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Close the suitcase back up.

410
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And then the other pages, I carried through security.

411
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I carried on my person.

412
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
If they'd caught me, I'd still be there in a gulag somewhere, but they didn't.

413
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And the goal was maybe we'll find out more from the Russians

414
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
about what our government knows about UFOs

415
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
than we'll ever learn from our government itself, which is true.

416
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We did.

417
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
George started sharing his findings with key players in Washington

418
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and his friends, Senator Reid and Robert Bigelow.

419
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I had asked Colonel Sokolov, what's the interest?

420
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
What are you trying to do here?

421
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And he said, it's really simple.

422
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
These craft can do things that we can't.

423
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
They fly circles around our best aircraft.

424
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
We know they do the same thing to you.

425
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And we figured if we could find one, figure out how they work,

426
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
we could kick your ass in terms of stealth technology,

427
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
because at that point, we were way ahead of them.

428
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Three years later, George returned to Russia

429
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and came back with even more bombshells.

430
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I interviewed this guy named Maltsev,

431
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
who'd been commander of the entire Russian Air Forces.

432
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And he told me about these encounters that Sokolov had recounted.

433
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Forty different incidents where Russian warplanes chased UFOs,

434
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and boom, they were gone.

435
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
In three of those cases, though, the Russian warplanes crashed.

436
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Two of the pilots died.

437
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And after that, this guy Maltsev issued an order,

438
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
leave them alone.

439
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You see a UFO, leave them the hell alone,

440
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
because, quote, they have incredible capacities for retaliation.

441
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
More than 25 years later,

442
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
a Pentagon whistleblower shared the exact same fears

443
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
that George reported back then,

444
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
a secret Cold War with some of our biggest enemies.

445
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
We're in a competition with our adversaries to understand this.

446
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It's a multi-decade Cold War that has been under our nose for so long,

447
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and, you know, there is no good way to level the playing field

448
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
and hold other nation-states accountable

449
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
if they're doing unethical or illicit activity

450
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
as it relates to the subject.

451
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And I think the up-to-secrecy is actually putting us

452
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
in a very dangerous position

453
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
where a country might make a breakthrough,

454
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
let's say it's an adversary of ours,

455
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and it is so destabilizing.

456
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
In June 2023, a worldwide exclusive interview on NewsNation

457
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
revealed alleged secrets within our own government.

458
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
What conclusion did you come to at the end of your time

459
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
on the UAP Task Force?

460
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
The UAP Task Force was refused access

461
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
to a broad crash-retrieval program.

462
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
We have spacecraft from another species.

463
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
We do, yeah.

464
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
How many?

465
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Quite a number.

466
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You're kidding.

467
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
No.

468
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I thought it was totally nuts,

469
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
and I thought at first I was being deceived,

470
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
it was a ruse, people started confiding in me,

471
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
they approached me, I have plenty of current

472
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
former senior intelligence officers that came to me,

473
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
many of which I knew almost my whole career,

474
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
that confided in me, they were a part of a program,

475
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
they named the program, I've never heard of it,

476
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
and they told me based on their oral testimony,

477
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and they provided me documents and other proof

478
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
that there was in fact a program

479
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
that the UAP Task Force was not read into.

480
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I've been told that there have been attempts

481
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
to bring down craft.

482
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
There have been instances,

483
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and there are certain techniques.

484
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Have human beings been hurt or killed

485
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
by a non-human intelligence?

486
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
While I can't get into the specifics,

487
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
because that would reveal certain US classified operations,

488
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I was briefed by a few individuals on the program

489
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
that there were malevolent events like that.

490
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Including this never-before-seen moment

491
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
where Grush describes the roadblocks he says he faced

492
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
when trying to pry for answers.

493
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You're telling us we're being lied to.

494
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yeah, it's an obvious intelligence community disrespect

495
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
to the legislative branch,

496
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
and I tried to gain access in my official capacity,

497
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and I had one agency say,

498
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
hell yes, we have what you're looking for,

499
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
we'll reach in, and then two months went by,

500
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
they wouldn't return phone calls,

501
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
they wouldn't return inquiries by the UAP Task Force director,

502
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
my colleagues with the same kind of statutory authority

503
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
to investigate this, and in one case,

504
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
they tried to kill all my security clearances

505
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
from that particular agency.

506
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It was almost like a show of force,

507
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I please don't ask again, Dave,

508
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
and I thought that was extremely unprofessional.

509
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And yet you were legally entitled to seek this information?

510
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I stated my official capacity to look into this.

511
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
This wasn't me trying to get access to a program

512
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I wasn't supposed to or anything like that.

513
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
This was in my official capacity.

514
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Grush's story, first shared publicly in June,

515
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
was actually known to George well before then.

516
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I had been told I might be introduced to somebody.

517
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm sitting in a bar, and they're shooting video of me,

518
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
just cutaways, and at that exact moment,

519
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
while they're getting video of me,

520
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Dave Grush walks up and introduces himself,

521
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and we started a conversation and got to know each other,

522
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and we've been talking ever since.

523
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And boy, he shared with me something

524
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
that I wasn't allowed to make public then,

525
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
but it was his whistleblower complaint,

526
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
what he had filed with the inspector general,

527
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
because at that point, they were already coming after him.

528
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Now, he had come to that conference to meet people,

529
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
to learn about UFOs, to interact with UFO world a little bit,

530
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and to interact with Jay Stratton,

531
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
who was the guy who had given this assignment.

532
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
He didn't come alone, though.

533
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
He was the boss, and his boss is boss.

534
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
They also went to this thing.

535
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
They knew what he was up to. They knew what he had found.

536
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
They haven't come forward, which is interesting,

537
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
that nobody's asked them questions about what he was doing

538
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
or whether it was legitimate,

539
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
but they were there because they knew what he had found,

540
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
and they wanted to support him.

541
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
We've heard these stories for years,

542
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
that there's reverse-engineering, crash saucers,

543
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
UFO secrets stashed in there,

544
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
hidden by the use of hundreds of millions of dollars

545
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
of national security dollars that are unaccounted for,

546
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
that Congress has no idea what it's being spent on.

547
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Go find it. And he did.

548
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
He had the clearances to go into those special access programs,

549
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
interview the people, put them under oath,

550
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
get their testimony, collect it at all,

551
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and send it up the stairs, up the chain of command.

552
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And once it became clear what he was doing,

553
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
what he was going after,

554
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
he was messing with the fundamental forces of nature.

555
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
These are powerful interests that have this stuff.

556
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
The keepers of the secrets are real,

557
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and they're not going to give it up, so they came after him.

558
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Coming up, it all comes full circle

559
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
as George's front row for historic UFO congressional hearings.

560
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
A multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program.

561
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
David Gresh's claims on NewsNation

562
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
sparked an unprecedented move in Washington.

563
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
A historic hearing specifically focused on disclosure

564
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and getting answers about what the government truly knows about UFOs.

565
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Mr. Chairman, ranking members and congressmen,

566
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
thank you. I'm happy to be here.

567
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
This is an important issue for the U.S.

568
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and the world.

569
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Thank you.

570
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
My name is David Charles Gresh.

571
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I was an intelligence officer for 14 years.

572
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I was informed in the course of my official duties

573
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program.

574
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And seated right behind the three key witnesses

575
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
was none other than George Knapp.

576
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So how did you end up in the front row, right there, of the hearings?

577
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Well, these members of the U.S. Congress,

578
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
haven't been at it that long.

579
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
They knew they needed help.

580
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
They wanted to set up a hearing.

581
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Do you have any personal knowledge of people who have been harmed or injured

582
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
in efforts to cover up or conceal these extraterrestrial technology?

583
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yes.

584
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Personally.

585
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Would you have had the capability to defend yourself, your crew, your aircraft?

586
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Absolutely not, sir.

587
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
No.

588
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
My main concern was that it needed to be bipartisan.

589
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It can't just be Tim Burchett and other Republicans, one-sided kind of a thing,

590
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
because the temptation to be really partisan can't help it.

591
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And he agreed to that.

592
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
He said, yeah, we're going to make it bipartisan.

593
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
We've got some Democratic members who are interested in it.

594
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And he did.

595
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
He kept his promise.

596
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And thank you all for being here and the courage it took to come forward

597
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and, again, the sacrifice that each of you have made.

598
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Is it possible that these UAPs are testing for vulnerabilities in our current systems?

599
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yes, sir.

600
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yes, possible.

601
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Is, based off of the information that you've been privy to,

602
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
is there any indication that these UAPs are interested

603
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
in our nuclear technology and capabilities?

604
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yes.

605
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
By external observation, sure, that could be a fair assessment, yeah.

606
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yes.

607
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Is there any indication that the Department of Energy

608
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
is involved in UAP data collection and housing?

609
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I don't have an answer.

610
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I can't confirm or deny that in a public setting.

611
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Could you do it in a secure setting?

612
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yes.

613
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
For the record, if you were me, where would you look?

614
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And I put that as an open question to the three of you.

615
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'd be happy to give you that in a closed environment.

616
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I can tell you specifically.

617
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Thank you.

618
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Commander Fravor?

619
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I would say, and I've told people, you have to know where to look.

620
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
They're not going to divulge it to you because of the classification levels.

621
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But if you know where to look and who to talk to,

622
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
which is exactly what Mr. Gresh can point you, then you have them.

623
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Okay. Mr. Graves?

624
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I was an operator,

625
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
so I was defending on folks like Mr. Gresh to do that homework.

626
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Okay. Thank you very much. I yield back to the Chair.

627
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Congress, it's a perilous moment for them right now.

628
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You saw those members of the House.

629
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
They were very passionate at that hearing.

630
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
They wanted to get to the bottom of this.

631
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
If you believe we have crashed craft, stated earlier,

632
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft?

633
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
As I've stated publicly already in my News Nation interview,

634
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Biologics came with some of these recoveries, yeah.

635
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Were they, I guess, human or non-human biologics?

636
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Non-human, and that was the assessment of people

637
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
with direct knowledge on the program I talked to

638
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
that are currently still on the program.

639
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And was this documentary evidence, this video, photos, eyewitness?

640
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Like, how would that be determined?

641
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
The specific documentation I would have to talk to you in a skiff about.

642
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Gotcha.

643
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Absolutely astonishing for me to see Tim Burchett and Matt Gaetz,

644
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
as far right as you can get.

645
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And over on the other side is AOC and Jamie Raskin,

646
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and they're all asking pointed questions.

647
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
They're all into it.

648
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
These are not questions just prepared by staff.

649
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
They're listening to the witnesses and asking good stuff.

650
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And they're pissed off.

651
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
But as I have said a hundred times,

652
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
the keepers of the secrets are better at their job than I am,

653
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
people like us are, at ours.

654
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And they are not going to let this thing go easily.

655
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The pushback has already begun.

656
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So yeah, it's interesting.

657
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Burchett said that too.

658
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
There were other witnesses that backed out.

659
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Well, I think there was a statement about other witnesses.

660
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
They didn't pass their security clearance or something,

661
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and that was not the case.

662
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Okay.

663
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
There was two other witnesses that we tried to get

664
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
who declined to be part of it,

665
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
but they might do it at some future point.

666
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Well, how do you think the Pentagon is going to react,

667
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
given, you know, your experience covering this issue?

668
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You know, they've resisted being truthful for 75 years.

669
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's not going to turn around on a dime.

670
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
But after what happened today,

671
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I don't think you can put the cheney back in the bottle.

672
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Mr. Matt, having covered this for years, decades,

673
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
is today surreal for you?

674
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
That's weird.

675
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It's really weird to see it finally happen.

676
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I had a moment where it kind of overwhelmed me,

677
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
thinking about, gosh, this is happening right in front of my eyes.

678
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
After all these years, progress finally being made,

679
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
it was quite a moment.

680
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It was quite a moment.

681
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I wonder, are we going to be able to figure out these mysteries,

682
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
even if we have, say, a crash saucer?

683
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Does it tell us where they're from or why they're here

684
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
or what their interest is in us?

685
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I've been up pretty far up the food chain.

686
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I don't know anyone who knows the big picture.

687
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Do you think there's someone behind the scenes that does?

688
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I think there are people behind the scenes

689
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
who know a lot more than we do, a lot more than I do,

690
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
a lot more than OSAP learned.

691
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I've heard about these people for a long time,

692
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
and somebody pulls these strings.

693
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I don't know that there was ever an MJ-12,

694
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
but I suspect that there was an organization like that.

695
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You know, I'd love to have the answers

696
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
while I'm still alive and kicking here,

697
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
but I'm not sure that that's going to happen.

698
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It seems like this is the worst possible moment for you to retire,

699
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
which you're obviously not retiring,

700
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
but are you working harder than ever, would you say?

701
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Seems like it. I tried to retire.

702
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It lasted two months, and yeah,

703
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
it'd be pretty hard to walk away from it now.

704
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
George has teamed up with UFO researcher Jeremy Korbel

705
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
for his podcast, Weaponized.

706
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
They continue to be at the forefront,

707
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
breaking some of the biggest stories.

708
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Congress has made it pretty clear.

709
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
They want this information. They want to have access to it.

710
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
They want whistleblowers who have information,

711
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
direct, hands-on experience with these legacy programs,

712
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
to step forward.

713
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Those people are really reluctant.

714
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
As we know, we talk to them.

715
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
We have passed people through the process

716
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
that are verifiably who they say they are.

717
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Other people whose names are not yet known to the public

718
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
or to the UFO world who want to tell the story.

719
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And George says there's more to come.

720
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
There are more whistleblowers,

721
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
and there will be more that will come out.

722
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
We know some of them.

723
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
There are some big shoes still to drop.

724
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Do you think it sunk in for you

725
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
how pivotal you were in all of that?

726
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I locked into it a lot, and I'll take credit where, you know,

727
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'll take credit if somebody wants to give me some of it

728
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
here and there, but moving here in the first place,

729
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
getting to know Lazar and Lear and all that,

730
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
the where it led.

731
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
You may not find out in a month, a year,

732
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
five years or ten years, but you'll look back

733
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
at what I'm telling you now, and you'll say to yourself,

734
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
my gosh, the son of a gun was right.

735
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You got to work it, you know, like a reporter does.

736
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
If it becomes your beat, you work it.

737
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I think what we can say about this is there is a body of information.

738
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
There is some kind of a phenomenon here

739
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
that can't just be written off.

740
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The government is sitting on a certain amount of information

741
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
that it isn't letting us know about,

742
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and I don't think the topic has been fairly treated

743
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
by science and journalism.

744
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It would be interesting if we could have

745
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
a much larger investigation by someone else.

746
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It does seem a lot more mainstream now, though,

747
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
to have these conversations.

748
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm thrilled when I see other media covering it.

749
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's fun. The public's interested.

750
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Our listeners, our viewers, our readers are interested.

751
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And it's important, too.

752
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I mean, the big picture, if we could get to the bottom of it,

753
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
it changes everything.
