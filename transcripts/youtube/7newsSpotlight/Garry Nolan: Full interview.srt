1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,520
You're going to Photoshop this, make me look like Chris Hemsworth, right?

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,860
Professor Gary Nolan is one of those precocious minds that when you meet them, you know you're

3
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,620
in the presence of awesome, incredible intelligence.

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,260
He's a Stanford University-based professor of immunology.

5
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,780
At the moment, he's a nominee for the Nobel Prize.

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,620
He's one of the most reputable immunologists on the planet, extremely well regarded.

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,480
He's got multiple patents, huge numbers of papers that have been published in his name.

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,940
He's got two companies listed on the NASDAQ because of successful inventions that he's

9
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,020
made.

10
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,780
He's just all around a complete total overachiever.

11
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,640
One of the things that I loved in meeting him was his candor, the fact that he was so

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
prepared.

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:08,300
He's very fast becoming one of the public faces of UFO, UAP commentary.

14
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:14,340
He's decided to take a very public profile because he's actually an experiencer himself.

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,940
When I asked him about the significance of the US government's admissions that have been

16
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:25,380
made about UAPs in the last 12 months, I was quite shocked and surprised at what he

17
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,380
told me.

18
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:36,380
Professor, what do we know for sure about UAPs?

19
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,780
The thing that we know for sure is that we don't know what it is, but we do know that

20
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:47,660
there is something here, something that I think defies explanation, but that something

21
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,620
can be studied from a scientific viewpoint.

22
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,860
There's a genuine mystery.

23
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:59,860
How significant is it that the United States government came out a year ago and admitted

24
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,860
that unidentified aerial phenomena are real, whatever they are, they're a real mystery?

25
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,780
I think it tells us that, first of all, the government has been lying to us for the last

26
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,900
60 or 70 years.

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:18,220
I think it gives solace to people who have been told that they were crazy to have been

28
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,300
believing or seeing this.

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,620
To me, at least from the personal point of view, from the human point of view, that's

30
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,260
one of the most important things.

31
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,260
I know this is speculative, but why do you think the US government's lied?

32
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,220
I think it's because, frankly, they didn't understand what it was and nobody wanted to

33
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,180
admit that, first of all.

34
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,140
But second, they didn't want to admit that they didn't have control over our airspace.

35
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,100
We didn't have control over our own airspace.

36
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,460
So it's as simple as, say, for example, the US Air Force doesn't like admitting that whatever

37
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,420
these objects are, they're vastly superior to what you've got.

38
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,660
And frankly, they don't know how to explain them.

39
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,660
Yes.

40
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:02,700
And what confuses me is if I were the Air Force and I saw something like this, I would

41
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,500
want to drive one of them.

42
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,780
If I was a fighter pilot who wanted to be in the fanciest, best next fighter jet, why

43
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,740
wouldn't I want to understand and push to understand how objects like this could maneuver?

44
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,060
That's what Dave Fravor said.

45
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,780
He said he wanted to fly the TX-

46
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,780
Yes.

47
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,780
Yes.

48
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
That's right.

49
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,420
So the government's been lying, but do you think there's been a cover-up?

50
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,420
Absolutely.

51
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,900
I mean, there has been both a cover-up as well as a disinformation campaign to make

52
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,180
people look like they were crazy.

53
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,020
See, this is amazing to me to hear a scientist of your reputation saying this.

54
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,020
I mean, you're one of the most eminent immunologists on the planet.

55
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,380
You're a Nobel Prize nominee.

56
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,020
You're somebody highly respected in your area of medicine.

57
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:54,580
Is it a dangerous thing for you to admit that you think these things about the phenomenon?

58
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,180
I think it's dangerously necessary.

59
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,580
I think that this is the kind of thing that if we continue to ignore it, if we continue

60
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:11,740
the potential danger of what it might represent, we are putting ourselves at risk both to what

61
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,980
it might do to us sometime in the future, but then ignoring the physics of what these

62
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,980
things are capable of doing.

63
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,180
Let's talk about it.

64
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,260
What is it?

65
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:29,380
You know, I wish I knew, and of all the people that I've spoken with on the inside, there's

66
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:36,660
really very little unanimity about what it is, except for that whatever it is appears

67
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,020
to be so far advanced from us that it beggars understanding.

68
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,660
So you don't think it's human?

69
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,340
I'm sure it's not human.

70
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,340
Is it intelligent?

71
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,420
Yes.

72
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,740
It certainly acts it, and in some cases, it seems to have a sense of humor.

73
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,580
So Gary, the implications of what you're saying, they're enormous, aren't they?

74
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:01,780
You're suggesting that there is a highly advanced civilization that is intelligent.

75
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,140
It's not human.

76
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,140
And it's real.

77
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,140
Yeah.

78
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,900
I almost hesitate even to call it a civilization.

79
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,500
Civilization implies a lot of interacting parts that are moving towards some sort of

80
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
goal.

81
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,460
I couldn't even say whether or not what it is that is being observed is something like

82
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,460
that.

83
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,860
Now, the classic explanation for years, and the reason everybody giggles is because they're

84
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,820
immediately thinking of little green men from Zeta Reticuli.

85
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,820
Do you think the highest probability is that whatever they are, they are extraterrestrial?

86
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,140
I don't think so, no.

87
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,500
I think it's whatever it is, it's been here a long time.

88
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,540
And certainly it's been here longer than we've been civilized.

89
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,500
So at the very least, who really owns the planet?

90
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Who was here first?

91
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
I'm not sure it was us.

92
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,420
Now, you're good mates with Lou Elizondo, who we've interviewed, who was the former

93
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,020
head of the Pentagon UFO program.

94
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:02,540
And Lou has suggested publicly that whatever this is, the extraterrestrial explanation

95
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,420
doesn't quite explain it.

96
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,420
Yeah.

97
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,380
I mean, it could explain it.

98
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,700
But you could equally, and this is Jacques Vallee's original hypothesis that he got in

99
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,540
a lot of trouble decades ago over, the interdimensional hypothesis, right?

100
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,020
Whatever this is, if you imagine an expanded universe conceptually, the multiverse that

101
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:32,260
everybody talks about, could be just as easily coming from over there as it is from the other

102
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,660
side of our own universe.

103
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,020
Now, you're a scientist, you deal in data.

104
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,940
A lot of people watching this are going to be incredibly skeptical.

105
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,940
They're going to be saying, what does he know?

106
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,420
Where's the evidence?

107
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,820
Where's the data to prove what you say?

108
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,220
So the data, frankly, is in the videos, first of all, that we've all seen now by now.

109
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,620
And if you haven't seen them, I'd go look up the Nimitz UFO encounter videos.

110
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:06,980
The other evidence is in the thousands of reports of things that people have seen.

111
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:13,300
Now that to me, you can call it anecdotal, but to me, I call it preliminary data.

112
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,900
It basically raises the question of what is it and what can we do about it?

113
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,780
Or how can we study it?

114
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:27,540
And so perhaps the best evidence that is thought to exist is the stuff that is being held in

115
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:34,900
government hands that many people, again, anecdotally have come forward and said, this

116
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,580
exists and it's not from here.

117
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,380
Now the thing I find fascinating is you've been kind of embraced a little bit by the

118
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,380
black world.

119
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,140
You've had the CIA come knocking on your door asking you to actually do tests on people

120
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,860
who have been exposed to UAPs, correct?

121
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,860
Yes.

122
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,260
What can you tell me about that?

123
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:01,920
Well, the reason apparently that they came to me is because we had developed instrumentation

124
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,780
for blood analysis that nobody else in the world had.

125
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:13,180
And so they came to me for that, not because I had some prior interest in UFOs.

126
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,760
They came to me for that.

127
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,600
And then I guess the embracing came because most of the other scientists with whom they

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,440
had met ran away.

129
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,600
And I was just drawn towards this.

130
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,860
But I also found it fascinating to speculate about what all of this might mean and what

131
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,860
it might be.

132
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,260
So I got brought in further and further.

133
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,020
So in your studies, I understand I've spoken to some people whom I suspect might have been

134
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,180
part of your study.

135
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:44,300
But there are pilots, for example, who've engaged what they believe were craft off the

136
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:50,820
East Coast of America, and they were exposed to what they think is some kind of radiation.

137
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,900
Have you been able to determine if any of these people have suffered injuries?

138
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:01,820
In some cases, not the pilots especially, but for some of the ground personnel, we were

139
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,460
able to see damage in their brain tissue.

140
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,700
That was considerable.

141
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:14,320
So this is injuries suffered by people, and is it directly attributable to the UFOs?

142
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,580
They claim it.

143
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:22,620
Now again, many of the people viewing will walk away saying that I said something happened.

144
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,580
No, I am relaying what it is that was told to me.

145
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,900
The confirmatory evidence that I have are the MRIs that basically show that anybody

146
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,740
can look at repeatedly and see that there was damage.

147
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,860
And when you say damage, what sort of damage?

148
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,460
You would call it a sclerosis.

149
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,900
It would be seen as a scar tissue in the body or the brain, dead tissue.

150
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,420
So it comes out as white blob?

151
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,660
We generally call it white matter disease.

152
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,220
One of the known examples of this that is public is there's a fellow called Thomas

153
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,580
Winterton, who's featured on the Skinwalker Ranch TV show.

154
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:06,980
And he allegedly was exposed to some kind of radiation or energy.

155
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,020
And you could actually see on his MRI a difference in his brain.

156
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,020
Oh, yeah.

157
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,020
Well, that was a horrific event.

158
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:21,380
I mean, not only was the brain matter damaged, but there was an edema across the back of

159
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,380
his head.

160
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:28,200
But I think in this case, this particular case, this was probably more Havana syndrome

161
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,580
like interaction where somebody with an energy weapon pointed it at them.

162
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,620
And as has been, I think, also talked about on that TV show, we were able to determine

163
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:47,340
the relative strength of the energy based on how far into the brain it traveled.

164
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,580
So the other thing that you've been roped into is analyzing samples.

165
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,780
And there's one case I'm fascinated with, which is the Council Bluffs, Iowa event in

166
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,500
December 1977.

167
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:07,500
And tell me if I'm wrong, police and 11 different witnesses from four different groups came

168
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:14,700
across a pile of molten slag that they saw fall from a craft of some kind.

169
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,860
A blinking craft.

170
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,820
A blinking craft.

171
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,460
It was still bubbling and hot.

172
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,460
The police testified to this as well.

173
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,420
They were on the scene.

174
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,360
And everybody says it came from this craft.

175
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,520
And I have the original Polaroids from the police of the event.

176
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,420
And quite a bit of investigation was done back at the time on this where they looked

177
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,420
at the metals.

178
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:47,860
And actually, it was beautifully looked at because they looked at all the possible normal

179
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,940
ways that this might have occurred, thermite.

180
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,380
Is there a nearby foundry?

181
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:58,180
There was a nearby foundry, but how do you get four by six feet of slag, steaming slag?

182
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,180
Right.

183
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,180
You would have to have dragged it.

184
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,760
And you certainly aren't going to put it in any kind of balloon and then float it over

185
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,820
a park and then drop it.

186
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,340
Because this was molten steel.

187
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,340
Molten metal.

188
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,340
I mean, it was molten iron.

189
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,980
And so one of the things it was looked at to see whether or not it was steel.

190
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,700
It was not steel.

191
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,980
It had iron in it, nickel, a few other impurities.

192
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,980
But what I found most interesting in our analysis of it, although we found nothing unusual about

193
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,980
isotopic ratios or elements that you wouldn't normally find in metals like this, was what

194
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,460
we would call the inhomogeneity of the material, meaning it was incompletely mixed.

195
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,660
So if you looked in one part of the material, you found all the same elements, but the ratios

196
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,380
were different than if you looked in another area.

197
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,820
The thing I find fascinating about that case is you've got some kind of material, metal,

198
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:56,040
being squirted, belched at by a craft that is witnessed by many people.

199
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,540
And it's not the only story like this.

200
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,860
In fact, there are multiple stories of these craft dropping stuff.

201
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,540
In fact, there's a case nearby that when I get the time, Jacques and I will visit with

202
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:14,080
exactly the same issue, multiple times seen in Fresno, these objects.

203
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,660
And one of them apparently dropped something right on these people's driveway.

204
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,460
I mean, a lot of people might be chuckling here.

205
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:26,600
I mean, why would a spacecraft, let's assume it's aliens or some kind of advanced civilization,

206
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,220
why would they drop metal on a driveway?

207
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
I don't know.

208
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,220
And I am just as equally bemused by the whole thing.

209
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,860
And I can understand the skeptical nature of everybody around.

210
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:47,480
So let's imagine, let's say that, for instance, this was an object, a UFO, et cetera.

211
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,020
But maybe this is part of the propulsion system.

212
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,100
And maybe when you're done with enough of the propulsion or something has gone wrong,

213
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,940
you essentially squirt it out the back and offload it.

214
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:06,860
I mean, it does, though, lend itself to the question of, well, how indifferent might this

215
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:13,780
object or the thing running it be to somebody below having a hot liquid metal dropped on

216
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,780
their head?

217
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,580
Or could it just be that ET has a sense of humor and loves the idea of driving a scientist

218
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,580
like you batty with curiosity?

219
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,580
Yes.

220
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,220
Well, there's certainly a little bit of that.

221
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,340
I often wonder, and Jacques and I talk about this sometimes.

222
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,340
This is Jacques Vallee.

223
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,340
Jacques Vallee.

224
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,340
Yeah.

225
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:33,140
How much of what is being done is them just leading us around by the nose for fun?

226
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,780
But continue to do it because I'm having fun.

227
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,780
Sure.

228
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:42,100
And the third object that I understand you've been involved in analyzing is a sample of

229
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,420
material which is known as the bismuth magnesium material.

230
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,580
Have you been able to reach any conclusions about that?

231
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:57,860
It is a layered material of bismuth, a little bit of lead and magnesium.

232
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,900
I've looked at the ratios of the isotopes there and there's nothing unusual about it.

233
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:09,540
But I will be getting a hold of a much, much larger sample of it that will allow me to

234
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,940
do some other kinds of tests.

235
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,940
One of the things that's been speculated about this particular piece of bismuth magnesium

236
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:23,100
is that if you put a waveform through it, I know this sounds daffy, it will levitate.

237
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,260
I have heard of this result.

238
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,060
I've not seen it with my own eyes.

239
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,060
Have you tried?

240
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:35,660
No, because the waveform that they needed to put through it is terahertz waves.

241
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:41,220
And that was why Tom DeLong's To The Stars Academy did the CRADA, the research agreement

242
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,500
with the US Army, because they're the only people that have got the terahertz transmitter

243
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,500
that you'd need.

244
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,140
Do we know whether that research has been done though?

245
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,740
I'm not allowed to talk about that.

246
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,380
Aha, this is getting interesting.

247
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:02,580
But the thing that fascinates me about that is some of the material that To The Stars

248
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:09,300
Academy was saying that it was going to be researching was material that was provided

249
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,460
to it by the US government.

250
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:19,420
And if all this stuff about UAPs is rubbish, why was the US government keeping samples

251
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,020
of flying saucers and flying disks?

252
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:28,780
I mean, the only thing that I, well, first you, because of all of the disinformation

253
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,820
that has gone on over the years, it's just like what you're saying about the aliens,

254
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:41,420
is somebody basically wasting our time by throwing something out that they know is irrelevant

255
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,820
or just basically a hoax.

256
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:51,980
But that said, there are many, many now stories of real materials that are on the inside.

257
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:58,260
And my push, and this is, I think this is, to the extent that people in the audience

258
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:04,540
want this as a subject matter to go away, is you want a definitive statement from the

259
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,060
government that the material does or does not exist.

260
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:15,500
If it does exist, then I don't even need for that to be given to anybody in the public,

261
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,140
but you would want a confirmatory statement that it does exist.

262
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:27,480
Lou Elizondo has said publicly, as have others, that he believes the United States government

263
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,860
is in possession of exotic materials.

264
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:36,940
Dr. Eric Davis, whom I know you know, very eminent physicist, has also said that he believes

265
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,180
that the US government has recovered craft.

266
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:48,660
Do you think that the United States government is secretly holding technology, non-human technology?

267
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,540
I mean, the best way I can put it is that I can see no reason that any of these people

268
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:01,540
would lie, especially Eric Davis and Lou, and in, let's say, more private conversations

269
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,300
that I've had with them, I've pressed them on the issue, because I've said, you know,

270
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:12,260
look, I'm putting myself out there, I am taking your word for it, and I'm putting

271
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,420
myself out there and pushing the notion that this needs to be studied.

272
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:22,740
So in my heart, it's more, maybe it's more of a hope that it exists, because I'm excited

273
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,100
about the potential of what we can learn.

274
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:31,620
If it's true that the United States government really does have a spacecraft, an alien spacecraft

275
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:38,700
of some kind, tucked away in a cave at Area 51, it means that while we may not know how

276
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:46,260
to operate it or how to reverse engineer it, we might have the secret of antigravity, of

277
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,460
free energy.

278
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,460
Yeah.

279
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:55,460
I mean, so for the audience, when you look at an object that can move like this, at least

280
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,740
two things are, three things are occurring.

281
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:05,740
One, the objects can move and accelerate to 5,000 miles an hour instantly and decelerate.

282
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:13,180
Okay, so whoever is in there didn't get squished, and so therefore they have control over momentum,

283
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,660
as well as gravity, these things can hover.

284
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:22,700
So for me, the open question is, okay, what's the propulsion source?

285
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,460
As a physicist, another physicist has published, if you were to take an object, assume it's

286
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,900
one ton of weight, and you were to move it instantaneously from 50 feet to 14 miles into

287
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,660
space, which there has been observations of this, the total energy required for that instantaneous

288
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,260
acceleration and deceleration is more than the nuclear output basically of the whole

289
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,460
planet for a year.

290
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,540
So okay, and they're doing it apparently every second.

291
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,580
And this is real, it's happening.

292
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:56,340
It is observed visually by individuals, at least the instantaneous disappearance of the

293
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:03,340
thing, but then it is observed by radar and other electronic means to be occurring.

294
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:09,820
It's interesting because one of the most important bases that America has for monitoring things

295
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:16,820
in orbit and things on the ground that might be signs of ICBM launches is Pine Gap in Australia.

296
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,020
And there are other bases like Northwest Cape in Western Australia that's been the location

297
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:29,020
for some very, very weird paranormal phenomena, giant craft, even military records recording

298
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:37,700
observations of spheres over the base at times of acute DEFCON heightening during the Middle

299
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,420
East War.

300
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,900
The Chinese are taking an interest in this very sensitive Australian military base that

301
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,740
is actually used by America to contact its nuclear submarines in the event of nuclear

302
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,620
war.

303
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,700
What do you know about China's secret UFO program?

304
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Do you think they know?

305
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,220
Do you think the Chinese and the Russians know more than...?

306
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,500
The Chinese have admitted that they have a program to investigate this openly.

307
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
They have admitted that.

308
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,380
Do you think they've recovered the same technology that the US has?

309
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,500
I wouldn't be surprised.

310
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,300
Brazil has had events.

311
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,420
Italy has had events.

312
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,420
Russia has had events.

313
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,740
I don't think they're avoiding China.

314
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,340
There's a Cold War going on behind the scenes, isn't there?

315
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,220
The Russians and the Chinese want to know what the Americans know and the Russians want

316
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,020
to know, sorry, the Americans want to know what the Russians and Chinese know.

317
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,020
Right.

318
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:34,700
Well, it's in science, when I have a competitor that I'm having lunch with, we're both probing

319
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:41,500
and trying to get the other's information so we can put together the answer first.

320
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:48,140
You explain to me, sir, as a scientist, if a country could master the technology that

321
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,140
lies behind this phenomenon, how important is that technology?

322
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,500
Well, it's a game changer, obviously.

323
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,620
But it's also individually a threat.

324
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,500
So if you have antigravity and you give it to everybody, anybody could go out to the

325
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,060
asteroid belt and push something our way and cause a big problem.

326
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:15,620
If you have access to the supposed levels of energy that these things require to move

327
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:22,220
around, everybody's got a bomb that is of dangerous levels of consequence.

328
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,580
So if you're asking questions, why might the US government want to limit knowledge

329
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,860
of this, they might have a perfectly good reason for doing so.

330
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:35,980
And that's it, that they realize that it's dangerous to play with this.

331
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,100
But do you think part of the issue now is that the game's up?

332
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,660
The Americans know that it's too well known about now.

333
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,700
There's been too many verifications of this phenomenon to ignore it.

334
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,140
Yeah.

335
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,500
I mean, the short answer is yes.

336
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:56,540
And there's an avalanche of information that's coming that we're seeing a day by

337
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,420
day.

338
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:04,380
We have, as you know, the US government coming out and saying, we now are creating an internal

339
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,980
secret channel for people to break their NDAs and come forward and give information to Congress.

340
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,780
They publicly put in the record now for funding to bring, it says exactly this, cadres of

341
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:24,660
scientists to the table who can have classification to study this.

342
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,820
So they're basically admitting, we don't have the answers, but we want to bring scientists

343
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,820
in.

344
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,180
Now, I'm going to take a little bit of credit for that because I actually wrote a white

345
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:39,500
paper to these internal groups that said exactly this, that we need to bring in scientists

346
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,460
in a classified manner to work on this.

347
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,580
So you don't think the Americans have secretly cracked anti-gravity and got a working spacecraft

348
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,580
to the cave somewhere?

349
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,180
I don't think so.

350
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,740
But who knows?

351
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,700
If they have, kudos.

352
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,740
It'd be pretty outrageous if they'd kept it quiet for this long.

353
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,820
Well, yes, it would be.

354
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,140
But I don't know what to say to that.

355
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,700
It'd be the Holy Grail, wouldn't it, of scientists going?

356
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,700
Yes.

357
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,740
Well, I mean, if they have cracked gravity, it means they have an understanding of gravity

358
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,300
that we don't even today have in our current physics.

359
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,340
We don't even understand gravity today with all of the equations that get thrown around

360
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,340
by physicists.

361
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,940
Why isn't this more mainstream?

362
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,860
I mean, why is this still such a stigmatized issue?

363
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:34,380
Why is it that in private company, when one admits that one has an interest in UAPs, unidentified

364
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,180
aerial phenomena, there's normally somebody in the group who makes a silly smirk and talks

365
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,180
about little green men.

366
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,180
Right.

367
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,180
Why do we do that?

368
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:48,260
Well, I think years of decades, frankly, of this kind of disinformation and purposeful

369
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,860
diminution of people's opinions has had its logical outcome.

370
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,140
But it's unjustified?

371
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,700
I think it's totally unjustified.

372
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,580
And from a scientific point of view, because I, of course, have been approached by scientific

373
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,020
colleagues that said, Gary, you're going to ruin your reputation with this.

374
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,300
And my immediate answer is what scientist takes a possible explanation off the table,

375
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,380
especially when you've got so many people, credible individuals, saying that this is

376
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,900
something that's happening.

377
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,540
So why not investigate it?

378
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,740
And anyway, it's my time.

379
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,900
So why is it your business to tell me what I should be doing?

380
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,740
Why do you think there is such hostility to the idea of investigating the possibility

381
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,460
of non-human intelligent life?

382
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,780
Well, that would put us not at the top of the food chain, first of all.

383
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:41,300
And from a religious point of view, it's a context clash that, okay, well, if these things

384
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,860
exist and they're there, where do they fit in the hierarchy to angels and God?

385
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,300
If that's your religion.

386
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,300
Let's talk about that.

387
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:55,420
Do you think that possibly what we're talking about here might be what our religions describe

388
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,420
as God?

389
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,860
Or angels and demons, that you need an explanation for something, so you put it into whatever

390
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,220
your current mythology is.

391
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,220
Because the suggestion that's being made by a lot of people who claim to have had experiences

392
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,620
with the phenomenon is that whoever they are, this superior intelligence is tinkering with

393
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,620
human DNA.

394
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,620
Yeah.

395
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,660
You know, I've had a lot of people come to me about the whole DNA thing.

396
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:28,460
And I think there's a lot more ways you can guide a species other than directly interacting

397
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,460
with its DNA.

398
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,700
I mean, look at what we've done with dogs over just a few tens of thousands of years.

399
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,860
Can I ask you one thing?

400
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,860
I read a Hungarian scientist's paper.

401
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,860
He's a mathematician.

402
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,220
And he looked at the probabilities of DNA sequences.

403
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:46,980
And he suggested that there are anomalies in human DNA that suggest some kind of intervention.

404
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,500
Is this the wow signal paper?

405
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Yeah.

406
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
OK.

407
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
Yeah.

408
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
What's your take on that?

409
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,940
Well, mathematically, it's sound.

410
00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:00,620
The only problem is that if you're, let's say, if you're a reader of Richard Dawkins and

411
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:08,380
the selfish gene and how complexity can arise out of selection, the counter to the mathematics

412
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:14,260
is that selection can create something which is statistically low.

413
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:20,180
The thing that I find most interesting, though, about that the wow signal in the DNA code

414
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:26,380
is how ordered it is in terms of like if somebody were to sit down and say, this is how I want

415
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,940
to design something, I'm going to design it in a nicely ordered way.

416
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:36,500
It is strangely ordered, which the only way you can, I think, countenance it is to say

417
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,460
there's something about the structure of life that required that order.

418
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,140
So you either created the order because you designed it or the structure of life required

419
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,740
it and that's why it came out to be looking like somebody made it.

420
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:57,140
Because when you think about Christian theology, Islam, a lot of the great religions, all of

421
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:04,260
it's about superior beings coming from the sky, as often as in Ezekiel in the Bible,

422
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:11,380
descriptions of strange craft, a lot of it does sound like UFOs, UAPs.

423
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,660
Well, Jacques Vallee actually took that approach in his book, The Wonders in the Sky, where

424
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:23,700
he went back literally into the libraries to get the original documents from the scientists

425
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:29,780
and statesmen of the day who had recorded these events, which if you basically just

426
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:35,460
changed the or translated the words, they were basically had encountered UFOs at the

427
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,940
time, shields in the sky, et cetera.

428
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:43,460
And then Diana Pasulka on the other side of things has looked at this from the standpoint,

429
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,500
what got her interested was she was actually originally studying the ecstasies of the saints.

430
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,900
She's a theologian of Catholicism.

431
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,860
She was studying the ecstasies of the saints and very often their interaction with angels,

432
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,820
as they said.

433
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,980
And what she found fascinating is that many of these angels showed up as white orbs.

434
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,860
And then it kind of clicked in her head that this was the same story of people who were

435
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:10,900
seeing UFOs, white orbs that would come and interact with them.

436
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,940
So here you have a religious tradition, a couple of thousand years old, very well written,

437
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:21,700
where we laud people and turn them into saints for their interaction with orbs of light.

438
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:28,260
And yet when you turn around and hear it from the neighbor down the street, they're ridiculous.

439
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:36,100
How much of your position on the phenomenon has been informed by your own personal experience?

440
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:42,500
I mean, so I did see an object very close up when I was a kid.

441
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,540
I didn't know what it was.

442
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,500
Can you tell me that story?

443
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,420
So I was a paper boy.

444
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,140
This was in Connecticut, Windsor, Connecticut.

445
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:56,980
And there was a man at the end of one of the streets who needed his paper by 530 in the morning.

446
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,620
And so I would always be there.

447
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,500
So I knew about the time.

448
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,620
It was dark.

449
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,140
It was March or so.

450
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,980
And I delivered his paper.

451
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,540
And then there was basically a copse of woods through which I had to walk to get to the next

452
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,100
street to walk the other way, deliver the papers there.

453
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,820
And because it was March, there were no leaves on the trees.

454
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,900
And as I was walking through the woods, I could see my shadow in front of me and the shadows of

455
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:31,220
the branches around me, which first kind of caught me off guard because I didn't remember

456
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,060
the moon being out.

457
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:41,380
But what was more, I guess, dramatic was that the shadows began to move as I was walking.

458
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:46,580
And they were moving as if there was a light behind me that was moving, which caused me

459
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:52,740
to look up and see an object right at the top of the trees go right over my head silently.

460
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,940
What sort of object?

461
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,540
It just was a kind of roundish object with, I remember, kind of like four or five white-ish

462
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,220
lights pointing down.

463
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,820
But I can't even remember how old I was, 10 or 12, whatever it was.

464
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,100
Were you scared?

465
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,140
No, I wasn't scared because I didn't know what it was.

466
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:20,420
I didn't immediately say to myself, this would have been 1972, 73, and I didn't say,

467
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,900
oh, there was a UFO because I didn't even know what a UFO was.

468
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:30,500
And it really wasn't until about 20 years or so later that as I paid attention, as anybody does

469
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,980
to movies and things and UFOs, and it kind of clicked in my head.

470
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,700
I said, wait, was that what I saw?

471
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:45,060
And so that story is like the story of many people.

472
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:52,420
And so I now look at that as, I would call it again, preliminary evidence, preliminary data.

473
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,980
I said, OK, well, that's worth understanding.

474
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,060
And if other people are seeing the same thing, that's a kind of confirmation.

475
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:04,340
So why are these people being derided for just reporting what they've seen?

476
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:11,620
Because if it is something else like that, it should interest any scientist in my mind.

477
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,140
You have had other experiences too, haven't you?

478
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,860
Yeah.

479
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,820
Can you talk about those?

480
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,420
This is probably the more unusual one.

481
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:27,300
And again, I'm hardly the only individual to have had this is you wake up as a young boy.

482
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,340
I would have been probably six or seven because it was in our first house

483
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:36,500
that my parents had bought in Windsor of little men in the bedroom.

484
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,060
You know, I mean, I was awake, I knew they were there.

485
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,700
I could see them scared.

486
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:52,100
I can't remember being scared, but I remember telling my parents the next day about it.

487
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,300
Could it have been a dream?

488
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,980
It could have been a dream.

489
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,540
But when so here's the interesting thing.

490
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,340
Here's the interesting thing.

491
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:08,580
I saw little men in the bedroom and it went on for I guess a few weeks and then it just stopped.

492
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,420
So I promptly forgot about it.

493
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:20,900
But what was critical was about 20 years again later, actually here in Palo Alto,

494
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:26,340
I was at a used bookstore and I pulled out a book

495
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,940
and I'm pretty sure it was it was either John Max or Whitley Striever's book.

496
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,500
Communion.

497
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,380
Communion.

498
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:41,460
And there on the front cover was and I can feel the hair on my arms going up was what I saw.

499
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,100
That's the classic gray alien face.

500
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:54,180
I remember I dropped the book because it was like, whoa, and it was it was a revelation,

501
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:59,780
I guess, but then, you know, but then I'm also I've read Young, right?

502
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,780
And the collective unconscious.

503
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:09,140
And so, you know, part of my self explanation for what it was that I was seeing was just

504
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:14,900
some collective unconscious genetic memory that we all have.

505
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,620
It has nothing to do with anything from outside.

506
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,700
So being a good scientist, you can't say it was ET.

507
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,260
Can't.

508
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,140
Absolutely not.

509
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:23,460
Yeah.

510
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,420
It made you think.

511
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,140
It made me think.

512
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:30,340
I mean, and, you know, I think being a scientist is all about being willing to ask

513
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,780
the difficult question.

514
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,660
Has that informed your willingness to look at the possibility that the

515
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,820
phenomenon is some kind of life form?

516
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,860
Absolutely.

517
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:50,500
I mean, what could be more interesting about studying life on this planet and how

518
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:57,940
our ecology has been constructed than to compare it to the ecology of another planet, right?

519
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:03,540
Two things are always more important than one in science that if you can find a confirmation

520
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:09,860
that life has started elsewhere, it means, first of all, that we're not unique and then

521
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,220
begs the question of all of the other things that we're seeing out there.

522
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,100
How many other places has life originated?

523
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,700
Because you had another experience in London that I thought was quite important.

524
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,420
Right.

525
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,540
Yeah, that was an interesting one because, you know, for no good reason, lying there in the

526
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:35,860
hotel, I woke up with my entire body buzzing like I was sitting in an electric water bath.

527
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,940
And I've, you know, I've been in Japan, for instance, where electric water baths are

528
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,660
kind of the thing.

529
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,180
This was a very different experience.

530
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,460
Everything from the tip of my fingers down to the tips of my toes, ears, I could feel

531
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,300
this buzzing.

532
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,380
I could hear it.

533
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:57,140
But at the moment of waking up, there were, and I don't even, can't even call them

534
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:04,100
words, there was, let's say, there was words in my head that said, this is how you connect.

535
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,180
Whoa.

536
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,220
And it, but it wasn't, that wasn't the word, but that's the best translation of the moment.

537
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,140
And after about 10 to 15 seconds of this, I just, you know, and this is why I don't

538
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:22,020
think it was physiologic necessarily, or some sort of odd physiologic effect.

539
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,980
I just said, this has to stop.

540
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:26,980
Make it stop.

541
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,820
And it did.

542
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,660
That suggests to me that the phenomenon's trying to engage with you.

543
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:42,020
I mean, it could be, but again, it's, I can't imagine why I would be so important that it

544
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,340
would take any time to do so.

545
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,300
Can I ask you this?

546
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:51,540
There are scientists, people in defense, people in intelligence, in government that I've spoken

547
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:58,580
to in Australia, who've all admitted to me they've had weird, I guess you could call

548
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,500
them paranormal experiences.

549
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,340
Some of them are UAP.

550
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,180
Some of them involve entities such as what you're talking about.

551
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,740
What's your advice to people like those?

552
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,140
I think the advice is don't be ashamed, first of all.

553
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,820
Don't feel that you need to come forward with it.

554
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:28,580
But I think the advice is others have seen it so you can believe that you're not crazy.

555
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,460
I think that's the first thing to do.

556
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:36,180
But then take solace in the fact that the US government and other governments are now

557
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,500
coming forward and saying that, well, you know what?

558
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
This is real and it's worth study.

559
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:47,380
The one thing I've learned from reading about quantum physics is that there's a hell of a

560
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,300
lot of science that we still don't understand.

561
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:57,540
Newtonian ideas of physics no longer really have much application when you start talking

562
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,460
about the quantum world, true?

563
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,820
Yes, absolutely.

564
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:08,020
Well, I mean, for thousands of years, even going back to Plato, we would think of the

565
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,500
atom as an object, right?

566
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,740
We think of even up until when I was a graduate student, I mean, even not a graduate student,

567
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,580
a student in college, we would think of them as solid forms.

568
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:24,340
But now we realize they're all waves and that a particle doesn't exist in any one place.

569
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,340
It actually exists in a superposition in many places at once.

570
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:34,100
Now, one thing you've been doing is you've been looking at the brains of experiences.

571
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,660
You've been using MRI imaging.

572
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:36,980
Right.

573
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:41,540
Have you reached any conclusions about whether people who've been exposed to the phenomenon

574
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,660
have characteristics?

575
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,060
So I kind of turned the question around in a different way.

576
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:54,180
So what we've done is looking at these individuals, we found that there is a bundle of nerves

577
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,540
at the head of the caudate and pitamen and their basal ganglia.

578
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:02,020
This is an important area of the brain that has to do with sensory perceptions

579
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,700
and actually integration of that information for goal seeking.

580
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,740
The executive function says, I want to do something.

581
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,980
It gets passed down to this area.

582
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,260
This area says, well, what in my environment do I need to access or know about to accomplish

583
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,140
that goal?

584
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:23,700
And then it creates a set of goals, sub-goals to accomplish the desired outcome.

585
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:31,300
So this area of the brain, and especially this one area at the head of the caudate

586
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:37,940
and pitamen, had overdeveloped interactions compared to normals.

587
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,180
There was a density of neuronal structure there.

588
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,300
And is that a positive thing?

589
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:46,260
Well, it's a positive thing insofar as the individuals that we were working with

590
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,260
would be considered high-functioning individuals.

591
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,420
Right.

592
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:54,020
So these are all people who came from the intelligence agencies, the pilots,

593
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,660
high-level physicists, basically smart people.

594
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:09,460
And so from that standpoint, it was fascinating because that said that just the study of people

595
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:15,380
who might have had these interactions revealed something about the human brain that people

596
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:22,740
at the time didn't know but now has been confirmed not only by us but by multiple other

597
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,500
laboratories who have nothing to do with the paranormal aspects of this but have shown that

598
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,860
the caudate is involved in intuition and intelligence.

599
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:36,820
Now, why it's important is that is intimately involved with perception.

600
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,940
And so if perception is about seeing something that's in front of you and not ignoring it,

601
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:48,420
then maybe you have part of the solution why certain people see something that others don't.

602
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,740
And we all know the story of one of the guerrilla walking across the stage.

603
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:53,780
Right.

604
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:59,220
So these people who are having these experiences with unidentified aerial phenomena,

605
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,420
they actually have differences in their brain in some of the cases you've seen

606
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,340
that might explain why they're seeing them.

607
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:10,180
Yeah, that they're basically smarter and they realize what's

608
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,260
sitting in front of them and they don't ignore it.

609
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,380
I mean, that doesn't mean that they're magic.

610
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,580
It just means that they see something for what it is.

611
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:25,860
And so people have asked me, well, is this area of the brain created by the interaction?

612
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,580
No, because in some of the individuals, we actually were able to go back and look at

613
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,220
their MRIs 10 years earlier and see that they still had it.

614
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,020
They're born with it.

615
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,860
And what's fascinating is it runs in families.

616
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,940
I was going to say, have you tested yourself?

617
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,660
Yes.

618
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,180
Yes, my family has it.

619
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,660
We're way up on the scale.

620
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:46,020
There's one physicist I know who's like twice as much as,

621
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,140
so it's my mother, my brother, and my sister, we all.

622
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:54,260
Because since I did the documentary last year and wrote my book, I've been amazed by the

623
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:59,620
number of people who've told me that the phenomenon of sighting these objects and

624
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,540
having these weird experiences that I suppose you could call them paranormal,

625
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,220
it runs in the family.

626
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,220
Mom had it, dad had it, granddad had it.

627
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,980
It's quite common, isn't it?

628
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:15,780
Yeah, so I wouldn't turn it into a movie script of some sort of magical ability.

629
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:23,380
If it's a feature of intelligence, then no surprise that it gets passed down family to

630
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:23,940
family.

631
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,580
What I find fascinating is it's almost like it's a dominant trait.

632
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:35,700
Because if it's a multigenic trait, multiple genes all coming together to enable a certain

633
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:41,220
what we would call phenotype, it would be much more disparate and less likely to be

634
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,460
passed within immediate families.

635
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,900
But the most interesting thing is this.

636
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,940
It's found in about one in a hundred people on average, one in two hundred people.

637
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:54,980
In a group of about, let's say, 20 people, we found two husband-wife pairs, both of whom

638
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,860
had it.

639
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,060
Okay, do the statistics.

640
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,740
If it's one in a hundred, to basically find the other person in that one in a hundred

641
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:07,540
randomly is a hundred squared, a thousand, right, or ten thousand, sorry.

642
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:16,500
And so but to have two people find it in the same group is an even bigger statistical flaw

643
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,700
or anomaly.

644
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,500
So what does that mean?

645
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:23,860
It means that these people are either in a limited breeding group, right, they all went

646
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:27,860
to the same school and they're smart, or they're somehow attracted to each other.

647
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,860
That smart people are attracted to other smart people.

648
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,540
So what does that do?

649
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:38,180
From a really fascinating evolutionary point of view, this is what you would call the beginnings

650
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,060
of speciation.

651
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:44,100
So speciation is when you have a uniform breeding population and let's say a mountain

652
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,820
range over time comes between them.

653
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,860
They now are separated, no longer interbreeding.

654
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,460
They go in their own directions.

655
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,300
So people who are attracted to UFOs are attracted to each other?

656
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,580
In a way, yeah, or capable of seeing.

657
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,700
Let's just say capable of seeing.

658
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,780
I wouldn't say that they're attracted to UFOs.

659
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:07,700
I would say that they're, I would just say in the simplest point of view, that this area

660
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:13,060
of the brain, which has now been replicated in numbers of studies, the COD8 especially,

661
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:19,620
and size and interactions as related to intuition and intelligence, are smart people are attracted

662
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,420
to other smart people.

663
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:28,260
Gary, the one area that I've wrestled with as a journalist in this field is dealing with

664
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:37,060
people who claim to have been abducted, people who claim experiences with humanoid entities.

665
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:44,500
And my gut instinct is to immediately be dismissive, to say, it's rubbish.

666
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,940
This can't possibly be true.

667
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:52,180
How do we even begin to investigate claims like that?

668
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,700
I struggle with it as well.

669
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,740
I hear these stories.

670
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,660
I know people who have made these claims.

671
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:07,140
The problem is that there is no or rarely any residual evidence of the event.

672
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:14,500
Others have said, well, why didn't they pick up a pen, an alien pen and bring it back?

673
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,100
I don't know.

674
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,740
But you have a psychological trauma of some sort that's occurred.

675
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,660
Again, people would call it maybe a screen memory for a traumatic event that was otherwise

676
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,980
best earthly explained.

677
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,700
But I don't know what to do about it.

678
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:38,740
I really don't, except just to say that it's more evidence on a pile that needs to be understood.

679
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,900
Which is why we were drawn to the story of Jim from Texas.

680
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:49,700
Jim's a guy who claims to have had abduction experiences ever since he was a little boy.

681
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:55,140
He describes beings with big heads, gray aliens coming through the wall

682
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,740
to take him away.

683
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,020
Some of it sounds fantastical.

684
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:07,460
And then all of a sudden he tells us he's got this sphere, this object that he was given

685
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:14,100
by a friend that the friend saw fall from a UFO, a craft of some kind.

686
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:20,580
Now we're not saying, let's be clear, we're not saying that Jim's got

687
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,460
extraterrestrial technology or alien tech.

688
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:29,380
But what can we do to objectively investigate that as a scientist yourself?

689
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:37,300
Well, I have seen the videos that you've seen of this ball spontaneously rolling around the floor.

690
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,380
And Jim has apparently had this for 40 years.

691
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,900
And so why would it move?

692
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:52,100
What kinds of propulsion inside might we use to conventionally explain it?

693
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:57,700
Well, you can imagine some sort of movement winds up a spring, you put it on the ground,

694
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,620
and that is why it moves around at some level.

695
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,980
But why would anybody make something like that?

696
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:10,820
And why would anybody expose themselves to public ridicule by claiming that it's alien technology?

697
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:21,700
Well, the most interesting thing about this story is that the metal sphere story came to my

698
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:29,540
attention because of a gentleman in England had been noticing in a lot of the pictures of claimed

699
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:36,020
UFOs that they were often, you'd have the central object, and then there would be at least three or

700
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,420
four of these metal spheres that would be surrounding it almost as if they were scouts

701
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,060
or guards.

702
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:49,780
And it's fascinating because he could go back 30, 40 years and find this exact same phenomenon.

703
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:55,620
You would have the central UFO, and then you would have three or four spheres around it.

704
00:47:55,620 --> 00:48:01,860
So you could claim that any individual picture was a UFO.

705
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:07,300
But this story of the spheres, these objects, really didn't happen until recently.

706
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:15,300
So how did a hoaxer, multiple hoaxers know five decades ago to not only put a UFO in the picture,

707
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,820
to put four or five spheres?

708
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,460
Because I have never heard this story before.

709
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,740
And I've read a lot.

710
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,340
You've heard of the bits spheres?

711
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,460
I've heard of them.

712
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,300
I don't know as much about it as I need to.

713
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:33,060
There was a family in Florida in the mid 1970s who found in a forest a metallic ball,

714
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:40,100
slightly smaller than the one that we've seen, but nonetheless a solid metallic sphere.

715
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,260
It did the same sort of things that are being described by Jim.

716
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:53,300
It moved around on its own accord in the house and became the subject of great hilarity and

717
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,900
fascination by different media.

718
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,660
And indeed, the US military got involved.

719
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,340
And at one stage, they admitted that they couldn't explain it.

720
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,100
I can't remember.

721
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,620
Did they take it and return?

722
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,180
They did.

723
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,020
The US Navy took it for testing.

724
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,180
And apparently, when it came back, it didn't work.

725
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:08,980
It didn't work anymore.

726
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,220
They probably just substituted it for something else.

727
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:19,460
So I mean, as you know, I'd love to get my hands on one of these things and investigate it.

728
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,500
Well, we've got samples that we'd like to give you in your lab.

729
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,460
We took, as you suggested, some scrapings of the corrosion on the side of the sphere.

730
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,540
What could you do with those?

731
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:34,260
I mean, I would do the same kind of mass spectrometry experiments that I've done before.

732
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:41,700
And then also, there's a kind of non-destructive analysis you can do.

733
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:47,540
It's called an electron backscatter approach to determine what some of the elements are.

734
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:52,980
Any mass spectrometry approach is inherently, partly destructive.

735
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:58,820
So I would be using the least of the destructive approaches for this.

736
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:03,620
Now, one thing I hadn't thought about, we were obviously at one stage keen when we were in Texas

737
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,700
to get this thing scanned in some way.

738
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:11,700
But obviously, if there is a remote possibility that this is some kind of technology,

739
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:17,380
it's not just a steel ball, nobody's going to put it into a scanner until they know what's inside it.

740
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,900
Well, I wouldn't put it in a scanner unless that scanner was in the middle of a field

741
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,900
surrounded by concrete because I wouldn't want something bad to happen.

742
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,700
So it's a big issue.

743
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:29,380
How on earth can we prove what Jim says about that object?

744
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:35,940
So I think there are very simple mobile scanners that might cost a few thousand dollars that you

745
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:43,620
wouldn't mind losing, first of all, to see if there's any kind of structure inside of the object.

746
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:48,180
As you know, you measured the weight, you measured the circumference.

747
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,100
We could figure out what the density was.

748
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,420
Was the density significant to you?

749
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,980
It wasn't pure iron.

750
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:02,660
Basically, the size of it, if it were iron or anything else, it wasn't pure iron.

751
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,420
Which means it's a manufactured alloy at some point.

752
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:10,020
It's a manufactured alloy or it is steel on the outside and it has something else on the inside.

753
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:15,620
Now, one of the explanations that was given for the Betz ball when it was discovered in the 1970s

754
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:21,620
was that it was part of a ball valve, that it was identical to or similar to a ball valve

755
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,180
that's found inside some industrial technology.

756
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,740
I guess that's possible with this one.

757
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:27,700
It is.

758
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:33,860
It's always the story and then the provenance of the object.

759
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,620
Do you trust the story?

760
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,340
And is there any other anomalous behavior of the object?

761
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,740
Well, it does move around.

762
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,140
And so I kind of find that fascinating.

763
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,420
It makes me wonder why.

764
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:55,060
And we've talked about, you know, conventional ways it could still do something like that.

765
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:55,940
Because it's possible.

766
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,100
I mean, we all conceded when we saw it.

767
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:03,780
It was moving around within a few minutes of when we put it on the ground.

768
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,540
It appeared to be stopped.

769
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,300
It appeared to be stable.

770
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,780
But then somehow it started moving.

771
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:15,140
So maybe it was movement from us walking across the floor or something like that that made it move.

772
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,900
We can't exclude that possibility.

773
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:17,720
Right.

774
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:23,860
Is there a machine, even assuming one can get access to be allowed to use the machine,

775
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:27,140
but is there a machine that can look through dense steel?

776
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:27,700
Oh, yeah.

777
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,180
Oh, yeah.

778
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,300
I mean, that's a standard.

779
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:33,220
I mean, you know, whether anybody would let you do it is really the question.

780
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:42,340
But I would say that, you know, there are people I know in the government that would

781
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,700
have such instrumentation.

782
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,260
I don't know if Jim would let the government have it.

783
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,340
I know that's part of the problem.

784
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:54,180
I'm not sure I would want to get it to them either, you know, but we'll see.

785
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,660
When you say the government's been involved in a cover up,

786
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,420
do you think they've been concealing?

787
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:58,980
Oh, yes.

788
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,380
It's an amazing allegation.

789
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,620
I know it for a fact.

790
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,740
I mean, I just know that.

791
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:05,700
Why do you know that?

792
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,780
Because I've spoken to the people who are about to come out and whistle blow on it.

793
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,140
Wow.

794
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,340
So you know what's coming.

795
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:12,840
Yeah.

796
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,980
So there has been a cover up.

797
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:15,480
Yeah.

798
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,880
And there has been an active cover up.

799
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:26,760
And what's nice, actually, frankly, about the transparency is the machinations and

800
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,360
maneuvering of the people who've been keeping things behind the scenes.

801
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,120
The light has been shown on them.

802
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,760
I mean, just look at what the Department of Defense announced last week.

803
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,320
They announced an office to study the phenomenon.

804
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,680
Money put aside.

805
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,240
They've said, we're going to go back to 1947.

806
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,040
Which is incredible.

807
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,320
That's the date of Roswell.

808
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:51,800
Yeah.

809
00:53:51,800 --> 00:54:01,480
1947, we want a list of every operation that you've done to disinform and misinform.

810
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,680
We want, and this is fascinating that they did this, we want a list of all of the NDAs,

811
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:13,080
the non-disclosure agreements that have been instituted around these kinds of programs.

812
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,680
Why is that interesting?

813
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,240
It's not the NDAs themselves.

814
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,960
It's the people who signed the NDAs, because that then is the paper trail

815
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,560
to the individuals and the programs in which they're associated.

816
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,680
Are you aware of a document called the Admiral Wilson document?

817
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,400
Yes.

818
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,360
Do you think it's genuine?

819
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:30,680
Yes.

820
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,040
Wow.

821
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,360
I mean, I know Eric Davis.

822
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:42,200
And Eric is of a kind of character that it's just impossible for him to lie.

823
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:49,640
The significance of that document is that the former immediate director of the Defense

824
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:56,520
Intelligence Agency, Admiral Thomas Wilson, allegedly had a conversation with Dr. Eric Davis,

825
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:02,120
a renowned physicist, where he imparted his discovery that there was a secret

826
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,480
UFO reverse engineering program going on inside the US government

827
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,080
where they were hiding recovered spacecraft.

828
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:16,600
And it was being hidden in private aerospace, in a private aerospace corporation.

829
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,200
The journalist in me, Gary, thinks Americans can't keep secrets.

830
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,280
I mean, everything leaks in this country.

831
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,480
And this is an example of it.

832
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:26,680
OK.

833
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,960
So you take that point.

834
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,360
Yeah.

835
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,640
Ultimately, it did leak.

836
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,520
Ultimately, it leaked.

837
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,880
But what was interesting was how it was found.

838
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:39,400
It was found in Edgar Mitchell's effects after he died.

839
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,520
So it wasn't like anybody went out of their way to put it out there.

840
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,920
And that's Apollo 14 astronaut.

841
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,880
Right.

842
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,840
And Eric Davis had written it.

843
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:57,080
And I don't know what the story was as to how Dr. Mitchell got a hold of it.

844
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,040
But nobody was looking to actively reveal this.

845
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:07,240
It was the work of journalists who finally got a hold of Edgar's materials who decided

846
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:07,960
to release it.

847
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:15,880
So why would Eric Davis lie about writing something that he never intended to go public

848
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,000
in the first place?

849
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,720
He was just doing what an intelligence agent does on a regular basis,

850
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,040
which is write reports of what it is that they've been doing.

851
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,160
And Eric, quite conspicuously, has never made any comment,

852
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,720
one way or the other, about the veracity of the document.

853
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,220
Right.

854
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,560
He can't, can he?

855
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,840
He can't.

856
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:41,640
But well before this came to light, I already knew of the document.

857
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:48,920
Because Eric was part of a group that I was associated with around this.

858
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,360
The implications of that are mind blowing, Gary.

859
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:58,920
I mean, this conversation, you've told me that you believe on evidence that there is

860
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,720
a non-human intelligence of advanced technology on this planet.

861
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,640
Right, advanced capabilities.

862
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,200
Now, I don't know whether it's a technology per se,

863
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:15,400
because I'm leaving open the idea that it's some form of consciousness that is non-material.

864
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,200
And I know, say to my colleagues out there, I know this all sounds absolutely crazy,

865
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,600
but if you've seen the things that I've seen,

866
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,200
you would only be able to come to a similar conclusion.

867
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,600
And I know, again, my reputation takes a hit.

868
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:36,200
I'm sure that there are prizes and other things that I am never going to get

869
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,560
because I'm talking about this.

870
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,840
That's nowhere near as important as the subject matter to me.

871
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,040
The best science, isn't it, is when you go against the grain.

872
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:51,800
Yeah. Well, that's Thomas Kuhn's book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.

873
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:58,200
Eventually, the anomalies and the things that don't fit the picture

874
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,560
add up to the point where you can't ignore it anymore.

875
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,280
And so that's what has just recently happened.

876
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,840
We're watching a Kuhnian moment.

877
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,440
This is huge, isn't it?

878
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,320
We're at a huge moment in human history right now.

879
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:17,240
To me, I mean, either it's a gigantic folie adieu, right?

880
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,600
It's a folie bazillion people,

881
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,360
or it's real.

882
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:26,520
And so on the off chance that it's real,

883
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:30,280
I'm willing to spend any amount of time doing it.

884
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,640
I mean, you know, the Mega Millions Powerball is this weekend.

885
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,040
Guess who went down and bought 20?

886
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,680
Even though I know that there's like, you know,

887
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,600
one in the 300 million chance that we're going to get it.

888
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,360
And I bet you'd spend all the money on science.

889
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,160
I probably would.

890
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,760
I wouldn't be doing my job, Gary,

891
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,240
if I didn't come back to the fact that you've told me,

892
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,320
you've spoken to some of the whistleblowers.

893
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,360
How hard has it been for them to come out of the black world

894
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,640
and admit that they know about a government cover-up?

895
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,920
Well, I think it's been extremely difficult for them

896
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,560
up until what Lou Elizondo and Chris Mellon have accomplished,

897
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:10,600
right?

898
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,600
Basically getting the US government to come out and create

899
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:21,880
now an atmosphere of allowance to talk about it.

900
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,160
I mean, it happened even like two years ago with the Navy where they said,

901
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,880
now we want you to tell us about these events that you're seeing.

902
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,000
We want you to stop hiding it.

903
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,200
Do you believe that though?

904
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,160
I mean, I'm sorry, I'm very cynical about the idea that

905
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:41,000
elements of the US armed forces have suddenly undergone a religious conversion

906
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,960
and decided that they want to be disclosure activists.

907
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,320
I just don't buy it.

908
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:50,280
I mean, I think the US Air Force in particular is trying to gag this whole story, isn't it?

909
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,720
Yes, but I mean, you just use the word religious experience.

910
00:59:53,720 --> 01:00:00,200
I mean, I hate to say it, it's pretty well known that the people within

911
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:06,840
the government who are the most anti-letting of this information out

912
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:11,880
are religious fundamentalists who believe that this is, I mean, talk about crazy.

913
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,240
They're the ones who think it's the devil.

914
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,640
Yeah, so they're saying it's demonic.

915
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,160
I mean, I've actually had people with conversations with people on the US Air Force

916
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,240
who've told me this is demonic, Ross, you shouldn't be looking at this.

917
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,120
This is evil.

918
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,840
So how do you counter that kind of worldview?

919
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:40,920
To me, even if it is demonic, I want to understand what they're doing and what their intent is.

920
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,200
Well, that was my next question.

921
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:47,480
Do you think on the evidence, it's well-intentioned, whatever it is?

922
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,440
I think it's neutral, to be honest.

923
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,400
It's ambivalent about humanity.

924
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,720
It's ambivalent and if we kind of get in the way of whatever it is they're doing,

925
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,000
you can get hurt.

926
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,480
Do you think the others, whatever they are, these aliens that you believe are here,

927
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,360
do you think they want to be known about?

928
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,800
Well, they're obviously not doing much to hide themselves.

929
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,760
I think they're showing us what they can do.

930
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,400
They do show up.

931
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,120
They've shown up around other nuclear sites.

932
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,240
We all know this now.

933
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,240
We've seen them over bases in Australia.

934
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:23,800
Right.

935
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:29,560
We've seen them around the USS Nimitz and it happens multiple times a week.

936
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,800
I mean, even today, and I've been speaking with people about that.

937
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,360
By definition, that's a threat, isn't it?

938
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,080
Yeah.

939
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,600
It doesn't mean they're going to kill us, but it's by definition a threat

940
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:43,320
because they're breaching the security of some of the most sensitive military installations

941
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:43,960
on the planet.

942
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,440
Right.

943
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:48,120
And I guess what they're saying is, well, who said this was your space anyway?

944
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,280
So why the interest in nuclear sites?

945
01:01:54,280 --> 01:02:00,840
I mean, I've said this before that humanity, I think, is on the verge of leaving the planet

946
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,320
as we know.

947
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:07,160
And I think any intelligence that would be looking at us from the outside that's been

948
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:11,080
around as long as perhaps they have knows what the trajectory of humanity might be.

949
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:15,800
And that would be to move out into the solar system and maybe eventually, even if it takes

950
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,920
conventional means to accomplish it, move out into other stars.

951
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,520
So here we are, a planet full of angry monkeys.

952
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,240
And we can't even take care of our own planet.

953
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:32,680
And we're threatening to move out into the nearby galactic arm.

954
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,160
It might take us 1,000, 10,000 years to do it.

955
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,520
Maybe our neighbors want to know what it is that we're capable of doing.

956
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:46,680
There's a document I wrote about in my book called Slide 9.

957
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,960
And Chris Mellon had accidentally left it on his website.

958
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,960
And it was discovered by a very clever British researcher who was just going through and

959
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,800
checking to see what Chris had on his website.

960
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:02,600
It's a document that was prepared as a briefing document for the Undersecretary of Defense by

961
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,000
members of the UFO task force.

962
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,680
I think Lou Elizondo's team.

963
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:14,200
The key thing about it is that it advises that whatever the phenomenon is,

964
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:20,840
it's capable of manipulating human perception, human consciousness.

965
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,680
It can make us see things that aren't there.

966
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,320
Do you think that's possibly what we're seeing in the sky in the form of UFOs?

967
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:34,120
Yeah, I mean, I think that's part of what makes it so difficult to reproduce is that

968
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,400
different people see different things.

969
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:42,520
I mean, the best example of this that I know is a story that Jacques Vallee brought to me

970
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:46,280
of a family in France driving down the highway.

971
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,000
This was like in the last five to 10 years.

972
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:52,760
And they had a glass topped car.

973
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:58,920
And they look up and they see a UFO basically paralleling them down the highway.

974
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:03,560
The mother looks around and sees that no other individuals nearby are freaking out

975
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,560
about this thing above them.

976
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,480
The children in the back take out their cell phones, take a picture of it.

977
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:15,720
They get home and they look at the pictures on their camera and they don't see an object.

978
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,080
They see a little star shaped thing about 30 so feet above it.

979
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,680
And I have the picture that doesn't look anything like a drone.

980
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:29,880
It's like a, I think it has like seven spokes and a central hole of some sort.

981
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:35,480
So you're left with this, they saw a giant craft, but the picture shows that it was nothing

982
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:35,880
else there.

983
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,560
Nobody else could see it.

984
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:42,040
So even if it was an object, it was, that was there.

985
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,800
Others weren't capable of seeing it.

986
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,040
So it was manipulating vision.

987
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,480
So yes, is the short answer.

988
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:54,120
There's a possibility, Gary, that you are one of the few scientists in the world who

989
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:58,360
are investigating what is potentially the biggest scientific discovery of all time,

990
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:58,760
isn't it?

991
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:00,280
Yes.

992
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:06,840
And what I actually hope to find, let's say, is that on the inside, there are other scientists

993
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,960
who've been working on this problem for many more years than I've even been interested

994
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:12,680
in it.

995
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:17,160
And they can basically, I'd be perfectly happy with them stepping forward and taking

996
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:21,400
the limelight because it's not about what I want to find.

997
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,160
It's about what is.

998
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,560
And if others are there which already know it, let's catch everybody else up.

999
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,680
So Jim, let's talk about Jim for Texas.

1000
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:30,920
Right.

1001
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,760
Jim's happy to be interrogated.

1002
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,840
He wants to be challenged.

1003
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:43,800
He's so thrilled that there might be any kind of scientific investigation into what he

1004
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,520
says.

1005
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,840
Is there interest in having a look at what he's got?

1006
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,640
Oh, absolutely.

1007
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:51,720
I would, but again, it's the resources and capability have to be there.

1008
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:56,360
I'm not going to go down there and ask him to give me the thing, and then I just take

1009
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:01,800
it home and wait to set up the kinds of analyses that need to be done.

1010
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:07,400
If and when you've got a laboratory that will accept this technology and be able to scan

1011
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,680
it properly, you'll do it.

1012
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,400
Oh, absolutely.

1013
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:09,800
Why not?

1014
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,200
I have looked at many things over the years.

1015
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:19,960
You probably, some of your listeners might know the Atacama Mummy example.

1016
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,400
Somebody wanted it to be an alien.

1017
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,120
I said, let's use science to study it.

1018
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:31,320
No, it turns out to be, unfortunately, probably a stillbirth of some kind.

1019
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,880
And I noticed Dr. Greer has maintained that you were obviously got at by the intelligence

1020
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,760
agencies to stop you from revealing the fact that it was alien.

1021
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:43,320
Well, he knows where the sample is, and the good thing about science is he could go back

1022
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,200
and test it again.

1023
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:48,920
So the point that you're making is that you're prepared to be rigorous and challenge

1024
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,320
the believers when you can prove it.

1025
01:06:53,320 --> 01:07:00,840
There's actually another, they called it the star child skull that I basically got my hands

1026
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,720
on to look at.

1027
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,480
It also is just human.

1028
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:07,320
I mean, it's not about the most spectacular cases.

1029
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,760
And this is the same thing in science.

1030
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:15,560
The best science is always noticing the points that are off the curve, that are the unexpected,

1031
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:19,080
because first of all, you have to explain why that point is off the curve, because it

1032
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,760
might be something wrong with your experiment.

1033
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,400
But if it is off the curve and it's absolutely reproducible, then you've discovered something

1034
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:25,800
novel.

1035
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,840
This is what we're looking at right now.

1036
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,120
It's off the curve.

1037
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:36,760
If it is real, it is, as you say, the biggest discovery in human history.

1038
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:43,400
But if it is real, it's already been discovered by the governments.

1039
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:50,280
So let's just get it over with and get the information out and start, you know,

1040
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:54,920
bringing the collective intelligence of the planet to study it.

1041
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,560
Final question.

1042
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:01,160
From what you know of these whistleblowers and the determination of the people in the

1043
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:06,440
Congress and people like Louis Elizondo and Chris Mellon, do you think we're going to

1044
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,120
get answers soon?

1045
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:08,360
Yes.

1046
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:10,680
How soon?

1047
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,880
I think in the next two years.

1048
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,240
And do you think there will be public hearings where people reveal into the Congress what

1049
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:19,640
they know?

1050
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:26,440
Whether they're public hearings at the beginning, no, I don't think.

1051
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,040
But I think there is we're getting ready for a public announcement.

1052
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:31,080
Wow.

1053
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,520
I think.

1054
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:38,120
And do you think that public announcement might be there is another life form of intelligence

1055
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,000
on this planet?

1056
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:39,240
Yes.

1057
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,200
I mean, that's the only trajectory we've got.

1058
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,520
I mean, I've always said that I've only ever been interested in studying the inevitable

1059
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,400
or working on the inevitable in my science.

1060
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,840
So I think it's inevitable.

1061
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,800
Professor Gary Nolan, thank you very much.

1062
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,920
Thank you.
