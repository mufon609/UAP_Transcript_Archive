1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
This story will challenge your understanding of reality.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,920
I've never had this conversation publicly, literally a game changer.

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,420
The mainstream media wouldn't touch it.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,000
We are at a turning point in human history.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,880
People's right to know.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,200
There is a real phenomenon here, there's no question about that.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,080
It's the biggest story ever, really, isn't it?

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:43,560
It is, it absolutely is, there's no doubt about that.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,720
Good evening and welcome to this special edition of Spotlight with breaking news from the stars.

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,800
Tonight we bring you critical new witnesses and revelations in our ongoing investigation

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,360
into the UFO phenomenon.

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,480
And we'll reveal startling information about an Australian cover-up sanctioned by the highest

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,480
levels of government.

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,520
Shortly I'll be joined by investigative journalist Ross Coulthart, who for the past three years

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,280
has traversed this planet in a search for evidence of life on others.

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:22,480
What he's about to reveal will stun even the sternest of sceptics.

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,440
This is a very real phenomenon.

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,440
This is coming directly from the pinnacle.

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,960
This nut of this earth.

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
We have no idea its intent.

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
What?

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
You know, it was absolutely mind-blowing.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,320
You don't know where these things are coming from?

24
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,280
We are well beyond reasonable doubt.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600
High level officials are acknowledging this.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,160
They are focused on our nuclear weapons.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
Highly trained observers.

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,040
I was stunned to my core.

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Fighter pilots.

30
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
Circular.

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Radar.

32
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
So extraordinary.

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,920
Iranian UFOs at the same time, at the same place.

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
Choo, choo, choo, choo.

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,760
The object knew where they were going.

36
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,560
I want to know the truth, Ross.

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,760
This is real.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Really good to have you here.

39
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,280
Ross, you've just published a book and documentary, they've been watched and read millions of

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
times.

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Huge interest.

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,440
How do you describe that interest?

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
What is it?

44
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,120
Well, it's one of the biggest questions.

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,720
Are we alone in this universe?

46
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,080
And what's happened is the United States government has come out publicly now, officially, and

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,600
admitted that there is a possibility that the explanation for the phenomenon that they

48
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
acknowledge now is real.

49
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,200
The possibility that that explanation is extraterrestrial.

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,920
As recently as last week in Washington, the director of national intelligence conceded

51
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,040
the possibility that this was extraterrestrial phenomena.

52
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,680
Have you unearthed new leads?

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,800
The number of calls that I've had, particularly from people in Australia and overseas military

54
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,920
intelligence is phenomenal.

55
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,000
Extraordinary things about sightings, mainly linked with nuclear facilities like Pine Gap

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,400
in Australia, North West Cape in far Western Australia.

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,600
Every day you wake up and you are intrigued with the emails and the contacts you're receiving.

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Absolutely.

59
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,920
And I think the days where this needs to be stigmatized and ridiculed are long over because

60
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,800
the Americans have now conceded this is real.

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Let's pause for a moment.

62
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,800
We'll look back at some of the revelations in your initial documentary.

63
00:03:45,800 --> 00:04:05,320
We're in a really interesting time in history here, where I think for the first time since

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,560
World War II, the US military is actually quite openly admitting that there's a mystery

65
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,520
it can't explain.

66
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:20,040
What we know is that there's a UAP task force, an Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force,

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,320
which quite incredibly has been operating in secret inside the Pentagon, apparently

68
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:40,560
for years investigating the phenomena of UFOs, flying saucers, strange craft in our skies.

69
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:48,200
We may be looking at a situation where we've got to consider the possibility of intelligent

70
00:04:48,200 --> 00:05:00,160
non-human life for the first time on this planet.

71
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,880
We have the sensing apparatus to detect objects, and as we found with the recent DoD videos,

72
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,080
we are detecting objects and they are highly anomalous in nature.

73
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,280
And they're not any known human technology.

74
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,640
That we know of.

75
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,020
We see this hyper acceleration with complete absence of a sonic boom.

76
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,280
We see the objects have the ability to hover and then rapidly accelerate in the blink of

77
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
an eye.

78
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,400
We used to hear these stories within UFO circles by UFO nutters, but we're hearing this from

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,500
credible senior level government and military officials that are all basically telling us

80
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,380
the same story.

81
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,420
And to what end?

82
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,580
Why would they lie?

83
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,380
So who are the officials that you attach most credibility to by reputation, who you think

84
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,660
have said interesting things in recent months?

85
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,980
I would have to say Chris Mellon.

86
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,340
So let's go through it very carefully.

87
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,420
Are these objects intelligently controlled?

88
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,980
Some of them clearly are, yeah.

89
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,580
Could they be Russian, Chinese, or any other attestation?

90
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,580
Conceivably.

91
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,780
We're entertaining that possibility, sure.

92
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,780
What do you think?

93
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:13,020
The problem with that is that in some cases the performance of these vehicles is so extraordinary,

94
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,020
it's so radical, that we don't understand how it's possible even.

95
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:26,980
And so it's difficult for us to imagine how our terrestrial rivals could master that kind

96
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,980
of technology.

97
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:44,620
In April last year here at the Pentagon, the US Department of Defence made an unprecedented

98
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,900
admission.

99
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:52,220
It acknowledged that the videos taken by their fighter pilots of unidentified objects

100
00:06:52,220 --> 00:07:00,420
are real.

101
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:06,900
So if they're not ours, if they're probably not Russian or Chinese or any other potential

102
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,140
adversaries, does that mean they're alien?

103
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,540
I think that we have to entertain that possibility.

104
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,940
Now you realise that is just mind-blowing in its immensity.

105
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
It is.

106
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,620
The implications of that are extraordinary.

107
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,420
We're talking about the possibility of alien life visiting this planet.

108
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:31,620
It is, and it is mind-boggling, it's hard to process, it's hard to digest, and yet as

109
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,220
a matter of integrity, scientific integrity, we have to be able to look at the facts and

110
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:45,060
follow them wherever they lead.

111
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,380
When we look at decades-long denials on the part of the US government and military forces

112
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:59,580
with regard to UFOs, they denied, they denied, they denied.

113
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,940
Then in December 2017, everything changed.

114
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,860
One of the world's greatest newspapers, the New York Times, revealed the existence of

115
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:18,300
a Pentagon unit secretly investigating UFOs, and even more extraordinary, it had the videos

116
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,820
to prove it.

117
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,420
He saw this white oblong object, which he said looked like a tic-tac, kind of zigzagging

118
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,420
around over the surface of the water.

119
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,740
What were the primary revelations in that story that made people, probably for the first

120
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,100
time, sit up and say, wow, UFOs are real?

121
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Well I think there were two.

122
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,180
The first revelation was that there was a secret program within the Pentagon that had

123
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,560
started in 2007 that had been studying these objects.

124
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,360
So this had been for 10 years secretly being studied.

125
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,080
Now you don't have a program studying UFOs if there's nothing to them.

126
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,560
The second revelation was the Nimitz case that happened in 2004.

127
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,200
There's a lot more to that case than we were able to report, but we got that case out there

128
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,640
in the public.

129
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,720
We were going to do high fidelity air defense training.

130
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,520
We launched the good guys off the Nimitz, launched the notional bad guys off the beach,

131
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
and they go at it.

132
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:26,600
The captain comes down to the combat and says, hey sir, you know we've been tracking these

133
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,640
objects for days now.

134
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,080
If we launch aircraft and we hit one of these, someone's going to ask you and me both why

135
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,320
we were so damn curious.

136
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,000
That's a very persuasive argument.

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What did the captain say?

138
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,360
He looks at me sternly, you're right, senior chief, intercept and V.I.D., visually ID it,

139
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Commander Fravor happened to be airborne, top gun training guy.

140
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,920
And as he began to close the gap, the tic tac recognized and began to react to his movements.

141
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,560
It sees him and he recognizes as a fighter pilot that it's engaging with him.

142
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,820
And so he's spiraling down like this, it's coming up to him and he's in a dogfight and

143
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:10,200
he screams out to his colleagues, I'm engaged.

144
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,240
So it's intelligently responding.

145
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,120
It is absolutely intelligent responding to his actions.

146
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
That's very important.

147
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
It is.

148
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
It's not a dumb object.

149
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Correct.

150
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,760
And it began to take evasive maneuvers to counter and maintain distance between his

151
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,840
aircraft that was closing in, by the way, an F-18 at the time, Super Hornet, one of

152
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,880
the most premier aircraft on the planet at the time, and this thing had no problem keeping

153
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
pace.

154
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,760
You're seeing whatever this object was.

155
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Yeah, I'm seeing it on radar.

156
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,040
Are you picking it up on radar?

157
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,640
Yeah, I'm seeing him do the intercept and as soon as he's at the merge plot, that object

158
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:52,760
went from 28,000 feet to the surface of the ocean in .78 seconds.

159
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,800
And then all of a sudden, bam, it's gone.

160
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:07,400
Bing, disappears instantaneously.

161
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,280
The accelerations that were observed would destroy five or ten times over any craft that

162
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,240
we can design or build today.

163
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,880
No visible propulsion system.

164
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,080
No visible propulsion.

165
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,520
No obvious signs of lift.

166
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
No wings.

167
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
No rudders.

168
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
No control surface.

169
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
No ailerons.

170
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
No elevators.

171
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
No cockpit.

172
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
No rivets.

173
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
My gosh.

174
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,200
All right, Ross, since then, a lot has happened.

175
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,840
There's been quite a few developments.

176
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,040
What's been the most significant development?

177
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,040
The biggest thing is that the Congress is now taking this seriously.

178
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,420
They're demanding reports from all of the intelligence agencies, from the defence departments

179
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,920
on the phenomena.

180
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,360
They're demanding transparency.

181
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,120
There's even a request in a new amendment that's very likely now to go through for any

182
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:01,800
disclosures to be made of recovered craft and even organic matter bodies.

183
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,560
Believe it or not, this is being seriously discussed in the Congress.

184
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,280
Those videos from America, they have changed the game.

185
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
They have.

186
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,320
The New York Times, when those videos were published four years ago this year in December,

187
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,800
they changed everything.

188
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,840
It was a totally new paradigm, especially when the United States government was forced

189
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,520
to admit that it couldn't explain the phenomena.

190
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,640
And Mike, there are so many more videos.

191
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:37,600
There are 144 sightings that were investigated by the United States Pentagon UFO investigators.

192
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,920
And literally all of them, except for one, couldn't be explained.

193
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:49,640
And I've been told the videos in them are incredible, identifiable, metallic, silvery

194
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:56,000
objects, disc-shaped craft, clearly visible, flying within 50 metres of a jet fighter.

195
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,360
And Ross, the biggest mystery centres around are mass sighting in suburban Melbourne.

196
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,840
That's right.

197
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,600
It's the biggest mass sighting in the world.

198
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,640
Hundreds of Melbourne school children, along with their teachers, witnessing an event so

199
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,760
strange and implausible it would change them for life.

200
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,880
Officially, the dazzling silver UFOs seen hovering above the school oval that April

201
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,760
Day in 1966 never existed.

202
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:32,480
But for those who were there, it was real, terrifyingly real.

203
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,120
Ross Westall appears to be sighting on such a grand scale that it can't be denied, yet

204
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
it has been.

205
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
It has been.

206
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,360
And in fact, the real situation is the government's basically ignored it.

207
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,320
Even though these people, 180 to 200 plus people, have said they saw these elliptical

208
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,480
disc-shaped objects hovering over a school in broad daylight 55 years ago, no government

209
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,760
official has ever provided any explanation for what happened.

210
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,300
There's one guy who's done a very thorough investigation tracking down those witnesses.

211
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,580
His name is Shane Ryan.

212
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:14,320
This is his story.

213
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:22,120
I've spent far too long going through National Archives documents, but they represent a fascinating

214
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,600
counterfactual history to the history that we've been presented in public by our defence

215
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,200
department for the last 50 to 60 years.

216
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:41,040
The Australian Government holds thousands of UFO sightings reports going back decades,

217
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,280
many of them once classified secret or top secret.

218
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,880
It might surprise a lot of people to know just how seriously those sightings were taken

219
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,100
by military investigators, even though some of those sightings describe crazy things

220
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,840
like hovering craft, flying saucers, black triangles.

221
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,000
But there's one very secret report, which I know exists because I've spoken to someone

222
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,520
who saw it being prepared, which isn't in these archives, and it should be.

223
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,680
It's perhaps Australia's greatest UFO mystery of all.

224
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:27,480
This is Australia's, possibly one of the world's biggest UFO mysteries, isn't it?

225
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
It is.

226
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,480
I think it's time to put Australia on the UFO map, because of this incident, certainly

227
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:41,560
in terms of Australia, maybe internationally, was the largest daylight mass sighting of

228
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:48,560
at least one, possibly up to three, flying saucers, UFOs, that has ever happened.

229
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Melbourne, in the sunny suburban swinging 60s.

230
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:10,400
What a time to be stuck at school. Westall High School, a college of about 600 pupils

231
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,920
in Melbourne's South East.

232
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,120
I was a very young man in those days. I was teaching, I was teaching a year nine, I think

233
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:27,120
it was, class, teaching science. Just before morning tea, the door flung open,

234
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,840
a young girl rushed in.

235
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,840
Mr. Greenwood, Mr. Greenwood, there's a flying saucer.

236
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,840
Mr. Greenwood, Mr. Greenwood, there's a flying saucer.

237
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:47,840
The bell went, and I can remember running out into the oval, looking into the sky, and

238
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:54,840
seeing these things, and just standing there absolutely transfixed.

239
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,800
When I looked up, I could see this object in the sky. It was directly over the far side

240
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,920
of the oval.

241
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,240
Never seen anything like it before in my life, haven't seen anything like it since. Trying

242
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,600
to absorb what we were looking at because it was just something so unusual.

243
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Shane, take me back to the 6th of April, 1966, at the Westall High School. What happened?

244
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,420
So on that day, something very unusual, something that the kids had never seen before, flew

245
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:43,420
into their view. It flew silently, it flew unexpectedly, and according to the witnesses

246
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:51,420
who were there, it looked like a bowl, turned upside down, sitting on something like a plate

247
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:59,180
or a saucer. It was silver looking, metallic looking, and it flew in ways that they'd never

248
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,940
seen an object fly before. These kids were very used to aircraft. Moorabbin Airport was

249
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,480
only a few kilometres away, a very busy airport. But this object, apart from being silent or

250
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:18,480
virtually silent, it flew very quickly. It would stop in midair, it would hover, and

251
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:26,160
then it would flick off and then flick on again on the other side of the sky.

252
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:33,920
It was a classic cigar shaped object that looked like grey metal. That's what it looked

253
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,200
like.

254
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,120
I actually headed over to the corner of the school and jumped the fence and went into

255
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,640
a place called the Grange, which is an area where we used to do our cross country exercises,

256
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,480
and ran towards where we had seen one appear to come down and land.

257
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,160
What do you think it was?

258
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,800
I'd love to know what it was. After 16 years of researching this story and talking to hundreds

259
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,680
of witnesses, literally hundreds of witnesses, people who saw the object, some as close as

260
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:09,080
a few metres away, I still don't know, but I feel as though I can say what it wasn't.

261
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,320
I feel as though I can say it wasn't an aircraft, it wasn't a balloon, it wasn't a kite, it

262
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:20,320
wasn't a drone, but it was something that, in a way, shouldn't have been there that day.

263
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,320
You actually saw one of the objects land?

264
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,080
Yes. Well, I didn't see it land, but I did see it on the ground in front of me. I could

265
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:36,080
feel a heat and hear this buzzing sound, and I could see purple lights all around it. I

266
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:42,360
know soon it got there, and within, I'd say, a minute, it just raised up off the ground

267
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:49,360
really slowly, just kept on rising to probably about three or four metres, maybe a bit higher,

268
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,960
and then it turned on its side and just almost just disappeared, just went straight up like

269
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,720
that, and I looked up in the sky and I could see the other two. So it appeared to just

270
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,040
disappear.

271
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,000
According to the witnesses, the people who were there, it left at least one, some say

272
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
several, rather large, perfectly round-shaped circles in the grass with a very definite

273
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:21,760
indentation, a very definite perimeter to the grass, as if the perimeter had somehow

274
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,760
been singed or discoloured.

275
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,760
What I want you all to do is to try and draw as best as you can what you saw that day.

276
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,800
And no peeking.

277
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,560
The witnesses gave descriptions that were pretty consistent. You have to remember people

278
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,480
were standing in different places at different times, but for the most part, they gave descriptions

279
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,520
that tallied with each other.

280
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,240
And what did they say they saw?

281
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,280
They say they saw a flying saucer.

282
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:01,280
It's like a silvery thing, like this, and it had like little lights around it, all lights,

283
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,400
underneath it, around here, around the edges.

284
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,040
It gave a lot of witnesses the sense that there was some intelligence behind it. They

285
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,560
say that because it flew effortlessly, it flew virtually silently, it could go wherever

286
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:22,080
it wanted. And for the witnesses who saw five very regular-looking aircraft like Cessnas

287
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,600
flying close to the object, as if it was trying to, the planes were trying to chase

288
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:33,760
the object and catch up to it, the craft very easily, completely out flew those aeroplanes.

289
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,200
How many witnesses have you interviewed in the 16 years that you've been researching

290
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,160
this who actually saw the craft?

291
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,160
I think at last count, because I've had a few witnesses come forward just in the last

292
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,840
few weeks, and I get new witnesses coming forward, probably one every couple of months.

293
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,320
But at the moment, I think I'm up to somewhere around 180.

294
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,600
180 people?

295
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Something like that, very similar number to that, and more who saw the traces that were

296
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:11,240
left behind, apparently, by the craft on the ground.

297
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
What did you see?

298
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,240
It's circular. The area, the trampled grass, and there were guards around it, and there

299
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,720
were people in there with equipment.

300
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,160
Do you believe the witnesses?

301
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
I absolutely believe them.

302
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,480
What do you believe happened that day?

303
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,480
Well, I've spoken to so many of the witnesses over these years, and they're very ordinary

304
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,040
people who tell an extraordinary story at no particular gain to themselves, and often

305
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:50,200
at some cost to themselves, because people often don't believe other people when they

306
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,560
tell extraordinary stories.

307
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,080
Let's talk about that. There's been a lot of ridicule, hasn't there, directed at the

308
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:03,680
whole issue of flying saucers, UFOs, generally. Is it deserved in the West Auckland?

309
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,640
It's absolutely undeserved.

310
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,920
Within 40 minutes of the sighting, Air Force and Army personnel, Alec and their trucks,

311
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
they were there.

312
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
You saw this?

313
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Oh, yeah, yeah.

314
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,720
Military turned up for sure. You're very sure about that?

315
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

316
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,920
They saw them there with lorries, with Land Rovers. They saw people getting equipment

317
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:37,160
out of their vehicles, equipment like metal detectors, Geiger counters, shovels and spades,

318
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,560
and they were apparently busily inspecting the site of these ground marks.

319
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:48,440
We know that two separate fire brigades were called. We know the Civil Defence Organisation

320
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:55,320
was called. We know the police attended both to the school and to the site at the Grange.

321
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,720
And the military.

322
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
And the military.

323
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,880
For 55 years, Tanya Vassy, who was 12 at the time, has been afraid to speak publicly about

324
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,560
what she saw that day. Afraid because she was warned off. Soon you'll hear from her,

325
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,480
but first let's look at the extreme steps taken by sinister figures to shut the news

326
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,360
down and shut eyewitnesses up.

327
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,960
What do you say to the fact that officially there is no government report into this matter?

328
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,840
Well, because they buried it, you know, they hid it.

329
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,200
Two weeks later, a knock on the door, and when I answered it, there were two people

330
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,360
there, one in plain clothes and then the other one, Senior Air Force. Obviously Senior had

331
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,600
a good many rings on his sleeve, and they told me that I was wrong, that I hadn't seen

332
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,800
anything. And when I tried to explain to them that they weren't there, I was, and I knew

333
00:24:53,800 --> 00:25:00,800
what I saw, and well, I think the first suggestion was that you'd be ill-advised to go on saying

334
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,800
that because clearly you were drunk on duty and that would have to be reported to the

335
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,360
Education Department and of course you'll lose your job.

336
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,520
They were threatening you?

337
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,480
Oh, absolutely. I was threatened.

338
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,560
You're describing officials from our government, trying to gag you from telling the truth

339
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,240
about what you saw.

340
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,040
Which is quite interesting when you realise that officials from another government, twelve

341
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:28,040
months later, beg me to speak about it. The Office of the President, saying that...

342
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,640
Let's be clear here, this is the President of the United States.

343
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,160
Yes, the President of the United States.

344
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
President of the United States.

345
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:40,160
The President had authorised the establishment of a board of inquiry or an inquiry to inquire

346
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:47,160
into issues of unidentified flying objects and that they were sending out somebody who

347
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,400
I believe turned out to be a Mr...

348
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,960
I think it might have been a Professor James MacDonald.

349
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,080
James MacDonald, that's the one.

350
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,120
Officially, he was working for the US Navy, but in his spare time he's checking many Australian

351
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,240
reports of UFOs and comparing them with American reports. His aim is to see if the reports

352
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,000
tally, in short, whether UFOs constitute a global phenomenon. In Melbourne, he's talking

353
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
with Brian King.

354
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,400
Professor MacDonald, what have you found here that's been of use to you?

355
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:23,880
I've investigated about 50 or 60 cases since I came down to New Zealand and Australia.

356
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,160
Extremely interesting UFO sightings, essentially similar to those in the United States.

357
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,640
What are the main similarities?

358
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:39,080
The reasons of really quite high credibility, reporting unconventional objects, discs,

359
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,880
cigar-shaped objects, frequently at very low elevation, hovering over sometimes urban areas,

360
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,680
sometimes over cars, following cars.

361
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,960
I met this Professor MacDonald. Basically, we did the same as I'm doing with you now.

362
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Just went through the story.

363
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,600
And did he treat you respectfully?

364
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,440
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. There is a recording of the interview.

365
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,720
You saw it. There was a hovering motionless when you saw it?

366
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,880
Well, it did several things. It did hover at different times. It seemed to be able to

367
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,520
accelerate and disappear out of sight and then someone would see it over another part

368
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,400
of the sky. It moved a considerable distance, but rapidly. And then it would move back again.

369
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:24,600
My recollection is that it was very much he asked some prompting questions and that's

370
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,160
all. It was basically for me to speak.

371
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
And why would it disappear?

372
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,080
Well, this is one thing we just don't know. It didn't just vanish.

373
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,160
All of a sudden while you were all looking at it?

374
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:41,840
No, it did one of these, you know, seven accelerations and nobody could figure it out again. Darn.

375
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,480
There clearly is a report somewhere.

376
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,200
You think there was a cover-up?

377
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,480
I think there was a cover-up of sorts. I'd love to know why there was such pressure applied

378
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:59,520
to some of the witnesses to keep the story under wraps. But for someone at some level

379
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,720
in government, they didn't want this story to get out.

380
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,520
This is the largest group sighting of a UFO, the largest one in the Southern Hemisphere.

381
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,640
And it's got a whole credibility because it's not as if just one person saw it. There

382
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,780
were over 200 people saw it.

383
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:25,540
What official explanation, if any, has ever been given by the government or any agency

384
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,660
to explain what happened at Westall?

385
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,700
There's never been any.

386
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,140
I mean the silence is deafening, isn't it?

387
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:39,140
It's deafening and it's perplexing and very, very frustrating.

388
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:46,140
It was something incredibly unusual, unexpected, that came from somewhere else. And I don't

389
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,780
know where that somewhere else is.

390
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,560
And it happened here in Australia.

391
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,340
In Australia's second largest city, in the suburban outskirts of that city.

392
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,340
In broad daylight.

393
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:05,340
In broad daylight, in front of hundreds.

394
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:15,900
Joining Ross and I now is former Westall student Tanya Vassie. You've never spoken before about

395
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,540
this. This is the first time. You were one of the first to see that UFO hovering that

396
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,460
day. What did you see?

397
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:29,460
I saw a shiny two-story disk. It certainly wasn't anything that we'd ever seen.

398
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:45,700
So you had an incident that took place two days later where the headmaster came into

399
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,980
the classroom and took you away. What happened?

400
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:55,980
Well, he took me to a room which I presume was a parent-teacher interview little office.

401
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:05,620
And there were two gentlemen waiting there and I was with them probably for about 15

402
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,180
minutes, being questioned.

403
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,780
Did they say who they were?

404
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
No.

405
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,500
What nationality were they?

406
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,900
Definitely American.

407
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,900
Americans?

408
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:24,900
Yeah. They didn't want me to speak of the incident to absolutely anybody and because

409
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:32,460
it was in the interest of national security. So we want you to keep this under your belt

410
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,780
and not discuss it with anybody.

411
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,020
Did they try and explain to you what it was?

412
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:45,020
Yes, they did. One of them actually told me that it was a very special weather balloon.

413
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
Did you believe that?

414
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:54,180
No. Not at the age of 12. I knew better. I know what I saw and it was definitely not

415
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,180
a balloon.

416
00:30:55,180 --> 00:31:02,180
Can I ask you this? Do you think it was something not of this world?

417
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:12,860
As an adult now, yes I do. Yes I do. Definitely. I no longer care what people think. I saw

418
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,860
what I saw. I know what I saw. I was not the only one.

419
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,420
Yeah. Ross, how significant is it that Tanya is coming forward with her story?

420
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,740
It's very significant. The thing that really comes home to me, Tanya, is the fact that

421
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:32,740
you corroborate that American officials were there trying to shut this story down.

422
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,780
Absolutely.

423
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:38,780
And it suggests there really was a cover-up and it was international. What is it that

424
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:45,780
the Australian and American government had to hide in 1966 that 55 years later we still

425
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,660
don't know what it was?

426
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,660
It's fascinating. Well, Tanya, thank you so much for sharing your story with us as well.

427
00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:00,660
Just as a matter of interest, what questions did you think I was going to ask?

428
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:07,620
I thought you were going to ask some questions about aircraft. It sounds like you're going

429
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,220
to ask questions about UFOs.

430
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:16,220
Well, it would be very interesting to hear your views on this.

431
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,680
You heard it there, Ross. I mean, when Peter Wish-Wilson raised this in Parliament only

432
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:25,620
last month, the topic of UFOs, I think it's fair to say that he was met with a lot of

433
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:31,060
mirth. He's insisting, though, that this is no laughing matter. Why is he passionate

434
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,180
about this?

435
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,300
Because he's hearing what I'm hearing from military personnel, not just in Australia

436
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,780
but all over the world. They're seeing these things and whether it's being reported up

437
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:45,620
the line or not, I think our Air Force, our military commanders need to start taking it

438
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:52,140
seriously because if, as the Americans have discovered, this is a threat to flight safety,

439
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,580
this is a potential national security issue, we need to engage with it. We need to study

440
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:04,580
it. We need to understand it, whatever it is.

441
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,500
It's concerning that we actually don't understand what these things are. We don't know anything

442
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:16,400
really about them at all. I probably couldn't have justified asking this question at Senate

443
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,140
estimates or using the Senate's resources if it hadn't been for these extraordinary

444
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:26,100
revelations that we've seen in recent months, including the Pentagon saying this is very

445
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,820
real.

446
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:33,820
I got the impression that when you asked questions about UFOs, UAPs at Senate estimates, neither

447
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,900
the Air Marshal nor the Minister were prepared for your question.

448
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:44,900
No, they certainly didn't appear to be around their brief, which surprised me considering

449
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:51,460
we saw a significant report released by our close friend and ally, the United States,

450
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,420
only four months prior to that.

451
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,660
This will certainly be having a round two. It will be interesting to see if their attitudes

452
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,660
change when we ask them more questions in the future.

453
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:10,220
You've spoken to people, I understand, in our military services who've seen these objects.

454
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:18,900
After I left school, I joined the Army. One of my lifelong friends joined the Navy and

455
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:25,220
we hooked up nearly 20 years ago after we both got out of the services. He just came

456
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:31,700
out with this bizarre story of a close encounter he'd had while on operation. I've been intrigued

457
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,700
ever since.

458
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,700
Do you think he would be willing to speak to us?

459
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:41,500
Look, he may be willing to speak to you, but I got a sense from him that he was almost

460
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:46,500
a little bit embarrassed about his confession.

461
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:53,000
I remember asking him, you're in the Navy, you're obviously out at sea, surely there

462
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,180
was technology there, this thing would have been detected and other people saw it. And

463
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:05,300
his view was, yes, other people did see it, but no one really wanted to talk about it.

464
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,140
The astonishing thing, Michael, is that we've been able to track down the person who Senator

465
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:16,580
Wishwilson's speaking about. The story he has to tell of what he saw on a Navy vessel

466
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:21,580
in waters around Australia is quite extraordinary, and this is what he saw.

467
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:28,580
The vessel I was on was a patrol boat based out of Cairns. It was about two o'clock in

468
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:36,540
the morning. It was just myself and an officer of the watch. We were in cruise control heading

469
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:43,540
west, clear night sky, very little cloud. And then all of a sudden it was a white light

470
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:51,540
and it moved. If you held out your hand with your index finger and your pinky directly

471
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:59,580
up, that's the kind of distance it moved. And it moved once, twice, and the third time

472
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:08,660
it just took off and the light was gone. I've seen aircraft do manoeuvres and I've seen

473
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:15,660
helicopters do manoeuvres. This is something that's not explained. Definitely a UFO or

474
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,100
something out of this world.

475
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:29,460
Is it fair to say that what you saw must have been intelligently controlled?

476
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:36,460
Yes. It wasn't space junk hitting other space junk. It was a steady white light that just

477
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:43,460
changed. I know it in my soul. Deep down I know, okay, that's unexplainable. It changed

478
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:53,180
me as knowing that, okay, we're not it. We're not it. Maybe they're watching, watching

479
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:59,140
what we're doing, laughing at us, thinking we're ants. I don't know, but we're out there

480
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:06,140
to intercept illegal immigrants at this stage. And it made me think, wow, if we're this

481
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:13,460
small, what are we doing?

482
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:21,900
Tonight we've been exposing the secrets, cover-ups and conspiracies of the UFO phenomenon. Before

483
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:27,060
we leave you, not many people know this, but on the far western tip of our continent is

484
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:32,700
Australia's very own answer to Roswell. And Ross, you went there as part of your investigation.

485
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:40,340
And if we are being watched from above, then it may provide the answer as to why.

486
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:50,780
I think that something extremely anomalous and unusual is still happening up at North

487
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:55,780
West Cape.

488
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:03,780
Dear sir, I hereby wish to report a most unusual sighting.

489
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:14,980
You couldn't pick a more remote part of Australia to locate this extremely secret military base

490
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:21,820
that was doing communications with America's most dangerous nuclear submarines at the height

491
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:27,860
of the Cold War. It's one of the last places in the country to see the light every day.

492
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:34,860
And one dark night, 30 years ago, a young Australian who was living here, called Annie,

493
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:40,180
had an experience that was to change her life forever.

494
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,180
And what do you see?

495
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:52,180
I see a craft. I see a diamond-shaped craft hovering literally straight above the vehicle.

496
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,980
Are there lights?

497
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,580
Yes, there's lights on the bottom of it.

498
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,580
How big is it?

499
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,340
I would say two to three cars in length.

500
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,340
Any noise?

501
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,780
Nothing. There wasn't a single sound coming from this.

502
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,740
Within seconds it shoots up, straight up in the sky, like faster than you could watch

503
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:19,740
it. And then it comes down over here.

504
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,620
When I was doing my preliminary research, when I went up there the first time, I had

505
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:31,420
people walk up to me at the table when I was having dinner one night. They said, are

506
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,420
you that journo that's investigating the flying saucers? And I went, well, not quite,

507
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:42,420
but I'm looking at the phenomenon. He went, well, good, because we've all seen it.

508
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:49,780
It was very early in the morning. No one else was on the road. I was completely by myself.

509
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:57,300
And I saw this light on top of a hill. It was pure, bright, white light.

510
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:06,340
The only thing I could think of like that was if it was to do with the military.

511
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:14,340
I have absolute clarity of that memory. It was definitely solid, definitely solid. An

512
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,660
oval the size of a car.

513
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Forgive me, why didn't you stop?

514
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,820
I think something was just telling me to keep going.

515
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:39,340
No, Exmouth is a place where it seems to occur.

516
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:45,780
What we saw was not of this world.

517
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:51,140
We are still transmitting on behalf of the Americans from North West Cape. And what happens

518
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:57,580
there is cloaked in secrecy. When we tried to go there and film around the base, the

519
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:04,580
Defence Department kicked us off.

520
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,300
They told us that we weren't allowed to film certain aspects of the base. It remains highly

521
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,980
confidential to this day. In fact, I think we had to pull back to a hill which was about

522
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,580
10 kilometres distant.

523
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,620
Is there a link between nuclear weapons, do you think, and these craft?

524
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:37,820
Yes, there seems to be a strong correlation between nuclear weapons, nuclear storage sites

525
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:43,060
and UFOs.

526
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,260
No question they are focused on our nuclear weapons.

527
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,820
And you believe they're trying to send a message?

528
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:56,820
I do. I think the message is get rid of your nuclear weapons.

529
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:07,100
Why would these objects, these craft, be taking an interest in a place like Harold Holt Naval

530
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,500
Communication Station?

531
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:16,500
Well, you know, these craft have shown the ability to disrupt communications. And so

532
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:22,940
if it came to the point where we had to use communications from that facility, they could

533
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:29,940
have disrupted those communications. I think this is simply a message to us humans to deactivate

534
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:38,980
all of our nuclear weapons and basically go another direction. And also to learn how to

535
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,980
live with each other in peace.

536
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:53,500
Regardless of whether you believe in aliens or not, that is a fine sentiment to end on.

537
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,220
Ross, thank you so much for your time tonight and all of your revelations from what we have

538
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,820
seen. I have no doubt there's many more to come.

539
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:09,380
I'm sure there will be, Michael, and thanks for the privilege. And good night.

540
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,380
Thanks so much for your company. Have a good night.

541
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,180
I have more questions for you. Let's go and talk about it.
