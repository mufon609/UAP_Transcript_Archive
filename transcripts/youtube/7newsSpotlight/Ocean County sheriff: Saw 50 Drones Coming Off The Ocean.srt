1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Former Governor Larry Hogan shot this video last night.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:10,040
These lights over his hometown in Davidsonville, just 25 miles from the nation's capital, as

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,680
he pointed out.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,680
And then there's this.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,160
New Jersey Senator Andy Kim shared this video of drones he shot yesterday.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,640
Federal authorities insist most of these sightings are actually legally manned aircraft.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,600
But Senator Kim says he checked a flight tracker app while capturing this video and that the

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,240
devices he was capturing were not on it.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,740
The sightings are happening near LaGuardia Airport, too.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,580
Officials say they received unconfirmed reports of drone activity over that busy airport.

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,160
As for numbers, the FBI says it's received more than 3,000 tips from the public about

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,160
drone sightings going back to November 18th, all over New Jersey.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,080
Since then, there's been an average of 92 sightings per night and expanding across half

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
a dozen states.

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,080
In a joint statement, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security said, quote, we have

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,680
no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,440
public safety threat or that they have a foreign nexus.

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:24,840
Lawmakers, however, aren't buying it and are pushing for answers and action.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,680
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and two other senators wrote a letter calling

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,760
for a briefing with the FBI and Homeland Security.

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,740
Well, in Connecticut, Senator Richard Blumenthal says the devices should be shot down if they

22
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,580
can't be identified.

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,160
And we've learned that House Speaker Mike Johnson did get a federal briefing on the

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,060
sightings, as have Senate staffers in a few select offices.

25
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,660
But other than that, there's been very little transparency.

26
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,200
So what's going on?

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,360
Is this some contagious mass hysteria?

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,160
Or are people really seeing something that our government cannot identify?

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,400
Our own Rich McHugh went out drone hunting in New Jersey.

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,200
He did not come back anti-handed.

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,440
Rich, tell us what you saw.

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,480
Hi, Elizabeth.

33
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,640
Well, I've got to be honest here.

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,320
You know, when this story first came out a few weeks ago, as a resident of New Jersey,

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,880
as a journalist, I didn't pay it much credence.

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,040
I thought it would turn out to be a bunch of pranksters, and this would all be over

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,440
by now.

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,000
The experience I had last night, however, changed the way I feel about this story completely.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,720
What I saw was more sophisticated than I ever imagined.

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
Take a look.

41
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,160
One, two, three, four, five, at least five lights, six lights.

42
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,040
I didn't believe what I was seeing.

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,000
But what was I seeing?

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,480
We're here in central Jersey.

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,340
We've been looking for the past hour.

46
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,180
I think we've seen about 40 or 50 of these drones.

47
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,540
In fact, there's one over my shoulder right there.

48
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,700
One after another after another, these drones appeared in the night sky.

49
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:08,500
If you look real close, they look like fixed-wing aircraft, about 8 to 10 feet wide, colorful,

50
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,820
white blinking lights.

51
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
That is not a plane.

52
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,700
Definitely not an airplane, but what was it?

53
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,940
Hours earlier, I was invited to join the Ocean County Sheriff's Department.

54
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,380
They launched their own drones to see if they could intercept the mysterious aircraft New

55
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,940
Jersey residents have been reporting in recent weeks.

56
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,820
The department says these mystery drones evade detection because they don't give off heat

57
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,460
like regular drones.

58
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,460
Why do you think that is?

59
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,460
We don't know.

60
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,820
It's just something that we haven't, you know, it's not something that we've had our hands

61
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,820
on.

62
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,140
It's not something that we've experienced.

63
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,300
Something they hadn't experienced until now.

64
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,620
One of their officers called 911 after seeing 50 of them come off the ocean.

65
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,580
Advised after we made contact with that officer that there were 50 that came off the ocean.

66
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,580
Fifty?

67
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,580
Five-zero.

68
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,580
That was my reaction also.

69
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,140
There were 50 that were coming off the ocean.

70
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,620
And this is a sworn officer?

71
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,660
Sworn officer, yes.

72
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,680
We contacted state police, we contacted the FBI, we contacted the Coast Guard, at which

73
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,380
point the Coast Guard went out with their boat, and they reported seeing 13 on their

74
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,460
boat.

75
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,940
And then the Coast Guard also advised that they went over them about 300 feet and had

76
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,540
a wingspan of about eight feet.

77
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,220
I see one right here.

78
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,100
Did I see the same thing that officer saw?

79
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,620
I'm still not sure.

80
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,980
What I can show you is this video.

81
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,900
What I can tell you is I've never seen anything like it before.

82
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,860
And more than a month since these reports started, the federal government doesn't know

83
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,340
what they are either.

84
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,700
What's your message to the White House?

85
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,940
My message is come to the Jersey Shore.

86
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,100
I know it's wintertime, but come see what we see and then, you know, maybe have a better

87
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,940
appreciation for why our residents are concerned.

88
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,920
You know, the Ocean County Sheriff, that drone unit, they have an industrial-grade drone.

89
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,720
They put it up, they were tracking one of these drones, Elizabeth, and they said this

90
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,820
thing easily evaded them, disappeared out of thin air.

91
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,620
So, you know, to me, if this is not our military, then it's even more scary and we need the

92
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,620
answers, frankly.

93
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,100
All right, Rich McHugh, thanks so much for watching.
