1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
We have to be comfortable with the fact that maybe when we study the abyss it studies us back.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,600
On this episode of American Alchemy we meet a 26 year old whose name is Deep Prasad

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,760
reverse engineering UFOs using quantum computers. Andy's raised 15 million dollars for his startup

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,320
quantum generative materials to do just that. There are too many anomalies around the world

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,640
for us to ignore. So now you're probably asking yourself how the hell do you reverse engineer

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,000
materials that you don't even have access to? Well luckily the pentagon has hundreds of instances

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,360
of optical radar and infrared detections of UFOs and from those records the DoD has laid out five

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,240
observable properties that are very consistent among the UFO sightings. These are things like

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,680
sudden and instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic velocity with no signatures. All of these are

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,920
properties that as my colleague Eric Weinstein loves to say exhibit wholly new physics not just

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,680
new engineering. If we're taking visitation seriously it almost certainly means that Einstein

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,040
isn't the last word gravitational. To me immediately I realized that's not your average

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,160
macroscopic interaction. He thinks that the five observables point to UFOs engaging in quantum

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,760
macroscopic behavior. So what exactly do I mean by that? Quantum physics generally governs the

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,760
properties of the very small things like atoms photons and electrons tiny elementary particles

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,040
that do spooky things like entangle at a distance tunnel through physical barriers and sometimes

17
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,800
exhibit wave particle duality. Similarly Deep believes that UFOs could simply be large macroscopic

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,640
quantum objects. What's to say that what we're observing now today with UAPs aren't just materials

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,200
more advanced materials than we have access to today whose emergent properties we just can't

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,920
model with today's physicists and mathematics right? But imagine if you have a computer that's

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,560
doing it a quantum computer with a much more powerful brain than any other human on the planet

22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,000
they may be able to figure out what these materials are. So strap yourself in and grab some salt

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,800
because your brain is about to be scrambled by the master quantum chef himself this week's

24
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,720
American Alchemist Deep Prasad.

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:36,960
Why don't academics in Silicon Valley, serious high functioning people, why the

26
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,280
fuck don't they take it more seriously? Yeah there's just so much social pressures basically

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,360
deterring people even highly intelligent people from wanting to study this subject.

28
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,400
I'm here with Deep Prasad who is 26 years old he has a quantum computing startup but part of the

29
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,200
mission of this quantum computing startup it's actually reverse engineering UAPs or UFOs based

30
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,320
on their observable properties. In some sense the most interesting starting point is like how does

31
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:15,200
one get into both quantum computing and UAPs. It completely blew my mind that the technologies

32
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,760
the observables and what was being reported there was no way in my personal opinion that that could

33
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,560
be a derivative of any human science. So you have hypersonic velocities for example right with no

34
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:38,800
signature. As the waves get created around your craft the waves at the beginning the sound waves

35
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,920
at the top will get bunched up and compressed and that's the sonic boom that you hear. So when an

36
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,560
object can travel at greater than five times the speed of sound like the tic tac which is estimated

37
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,680
to reach at least 31 times the speed of sound and it doesn't disturb the air around you to me

38
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,320
immediately I realized that's not your average macroscopic interaction so the physics that we

39
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,600
use to describe macroscopic bodies no longer applies to these things. Like my colleague Eric

40
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,840
Weinstein likes to say this isn't new engineering it's new physics. Correct. The role of aerospace

41
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,440
companies as holders of potentially basic scientific knowledge not shared with the academic

42
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:22,000
world seems very wrong to me. Maybe wrong but it's true. It is true you believe it's true.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,560
Yeah I know it's true. You know that there's physics knowledge held by aerospace companies

44
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,600
that is not known. There certainly is materials knowledge which involves topological physics.

45
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,200
Eric and I had a pretty trippy conversation with the guy that briefs all of the presidents on UFOs

46
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,800
a guy named Hal Putoff. For more of that conversation you might have to wait a couple

47
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,120
of weeks but let's get back to deep. Okay so how does this relate to your interest in quantum

48
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,920
computing? You know what let me give you like an actual example and why this might apply to UAPs.

49
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:03,360
Yeah. So okay so let's rewind to 1911 because we can never ever observe absolute zero we should

50
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,280
never be able to observe exactly zero resistance and in 1911 when Dr. Ohm's discovered the first

51
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,400
superconductor it blew everybody's mind because this was supposed to be thought impossible and

52
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,920
40 years later we finally understood why this was even possible at all and we learned that

53
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,880
it's because of quantum mechanics that quantum mechanical behavior occurs at the macroscopic

54
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,920
scale and that's what we're observing and it only applies to keep in mind low temperature

55
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,320
superconductors we still don't know how high temperature superconductors work we know that

56
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,320
it's some weird quantum phenomenon but we don't have the physics and perhaps mathematics to

57
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,560
describe what's happening there or the computers. So what did we learn in 1911? We learned that

58
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,160
when a material breaks the laws of physics when anything does it's actually probably because it's

59
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,840
an emergent property or an emergent phenomenon right of underlying strange quantum mechanics

60
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,920
that are going on. Okay so you're looking at properties of UAPs things like you know

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,160
hypersonic travel with no signatures or you know breaking conservation of momentum

62
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,920
you can't make that work in sort of our classical physics or aerospace you know abilities so you

63
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,760
have that and then you have this interest sort of in quantum field theory how does this relate to

64
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,200
quantum computing and yeah how do you tie it all together? So look when I first started quantum

65
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:37,840
computing my goal was to be able to simulate any new material and predict it before having

66
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,120
to make it in the lab right I wanted to be able to tell is this new combination of atoms going

67
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,880
to be the next semiconductor will it be the next solar cell the next batteries that's cool so you

68
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,160
wanted like the ultimate modeling software or something you got it like the what Tesla could

69
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,560
do in his brain and you would be able to do that with quantum computing or we will oh absolutely

70
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,240
here's why the classic equation that we'd use to simulate the properties of atoms would be the

71
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,840
Schrodinger's many-body equation if you can solve that many-body Schrodinger equation you will know

72
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,000
everything about that material you will know the speed of sound in that material you will know its

73
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,840
resonance frequency you will know its heat capacity its strength the problem is that in the past we

74
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,120
haven't been able to do this equation for more than about three atoms yeah not much it's not

75
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,640
it's not very useful right in other words the many-body equation has a scaling problem as Paul

76
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,720
Dirac said he literally said everything we want to know about materials hasn't figured out we

77
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,800
just don't have the computational resources interesting to solve this equation deep thinks

78
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,160
that the bottleneck for solving this equation at scale is basically just using classical computers

79
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,960
and with quantum computing we might actually be able to do it and simulate meta materials that

80
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,920
exhibit the five observable properties of ufos

81
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,080
we engineer every technology today and in the sense that we treat quantum effects as a side

82
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,680
effect an artifact a consequence that we have to engineer around quantum computers

83
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,000
decide they take a different approach they say instead of treating quantum effects

84
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,280
as this unwanted thing that we're engineering around right incorporating accounting for

85
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,360
let's actually leverage it let's create quantum systems of our own and manipulate them so that

86
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,840
we can simulate other quantum systems because in order to simulate nature and nature's quantum

87
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:42,640
mechanical you need a system that is also quantum mechanical the quantum mechanical world is like a

88
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,800
powerful and ethereal anything can happen in it however as soon as somebody on the outside disturbs

89
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,240
you you wake up and all you're left with are memories similarly subatomic particles exist

90
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,520
in a probabilistic state of many possibilities but when they interact with an observer they

91
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,440
collapse into a single state as a result quantum hardware which relies on maintaining two or more

92
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,720
states in quantum superposition will decohere if they're interfered with by anything from the

93
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,880
outside this is the main bottleneck for building fully fledged and functional quantum computers

94
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,680
they're incredibly sensitive and they often require very specific and energy intensive

95
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,720
environments in order to maintain coherence this is why initially deep is using a quantum

96
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,800
computer simulator instead of quantum hardware all quantum computers the algorithms that we're

97
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,360
running on them they are universal computations what that means is that we will be able to model

98
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,400
any algorithm we want on quantum computers and so what we can do is if you're smart enough if

99
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,000
you're clever enough you can figure out the right mathematical representation of the many

100
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,960
bodies showing your equation and port it onto a quantum computer simply by the fact that you can

101
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,320
approximate any algorithm you want on a quantum computer so if you have algorithms and mathematical

102
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,680
models that that map right from quantum computing to many bodies showing equations you're in the

103
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,240
money and that's what we do right we do hardcore research into how to map these material science

104
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,560
problems on a quantum computers describe to the audience what a qubit is it's the quantum version

105
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:25,040
of a bit a bit is the fundamental unit of information for classical computers right one or zero one or

106
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,280
zero exactly but the fundamental smallest unit of information you can have in a quantum system

107
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,360
is a qubit qubits can take on superpositions of states right and so what a lot of people in

108
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,040
popular culture popular science butcher when they describe superpositions is that they say that the

109
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,280
qubit is both one and zero at the same time that's not true it's not in the one state it's not in the

110
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,120
zero state it's not in the one and zero state either it's also not not in the one and not in

111
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:02,240
the zero state it's in a superposition state but how does that equate to transmitting more information

112
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,680
more information yeah exactly if i were to have let's say just 10 bits right it sounds trivial

113
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,080
but it takes 10 bits to describe the state of 10 bits right but if i have 10 qubits then i need

114
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,640
two to the 10 classical bits to represent the entire quantum state of those 10 qubits because

115
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:28,160
you can have all the qubits entangled with each other meaning that they can all to describe one

116
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,880
you have to describe what's happening to all the others take a caffeine molecule right the

117
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,480
the caffeine molecule is sesame to have about like 97 electrons right at least and to describe

118
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,840
97 electrons fully like fully entangled 97 electrons right to properly account for that

119
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:54,080
you would need to to the 97 classical bits and that's more atoms than the surface and

120
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:00,240
all planet earth right minus the air so even if i took every single atom on planet earth

121
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,920
and convert it into classical bit i wouldn't be able to store the quantum state of a caffeine molecule

122
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,200
for some reason nature is able to do a level of bookkeeping in the background

123
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:22,880
with quantum states that we don't fully know how it does it nature does this bookkeeping

124
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,320
that's so computationally impossible for us to do today right and that's where like ideas of the

125
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,960
multiverse and into multiverse interpretation comes in and so on right where people will say

126
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,800
well nature's not actually storing it anywhere it's actually just distributed across different

127
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,600
universes we have a sense of where it gets stored so obviously but there's a way in which quantum

128
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,200
computing sort of simulates nature more accurately and so can store more but do we have a sense of

129
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,000
how the computing is storing either that's also somewhat of a black box where complete black box

130
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,680
we can engineer them interesting but we have no fucking clue why it works wow that's pretty nutty

131
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,360
every physical material ever is a quantum system your brain your skin everything is made of atoms

132
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,040
and all atoms are described by quantum mechanical rules it's almost a form of blind exceptionalism

133
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,040
to say that the body is not quantum because everything else is quantum so that how much

134
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,040
quantum sensing is going on that's unclear but exactly it's not like we we came into existence

135
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,680
as giant macroscopic bodies right we literally started from amoeba we were closer than the

136
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,280
quantum scale when we started out so it's hard to imagine that that we didn't evolve even at

137
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:41,280
the cellular level some ability to use quantum effects for sure do you think your brain is a

138
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:47,200
quantum sensor like the the penrose argument would be so it's like we don't perceive anything

139
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,920
kind of in its quantum form obviously we perceive you know a bigger proportion kind of classical

140
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,160
stuff right and the penrose argument would be that you know you have a probabilistic universe

141
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,760
you have schrodinger's wave equation and we're collapsing schrodinger's wave into a specific

142
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,760
eigenstate right using you know this some some quantum sensor in our brain maybe microtubules

143
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,600
or maybe something else right do you believe that or the thing is that with our brain there may be

144
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,120
parts of our brain that could behave like a quantum sensor we know that there are birds that can

145
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,040
navigate the earth's magnetic field and sense it right using quantum sensing essentially biological

146
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:34,160
quantum sensing yeah the body in biology at large is typically warm wet and noisy not conditions

147
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,280
that you think of as conducive to maintaining quantum coherence or exhibiting quantum properties

148
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,320
but scientists now know that there are actually parts of biology that do exhibit quantum effects

149
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,920
for example there are birds called robins that have a specific protein called a crypto chrome

150
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:57,440
in their eye called cry4 that actually uses quantum effects to sense the magnetic field of

151
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:05,040
the earth electron pairs in the cry4 protein arrange themselves based on the robin's position

152
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,280
and direct the bird where it needs to go based on the magnetic field of the earth

153
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:16,160
it's basically biological gps lockheed observed these birds right or like the physics and and they

154
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,520
decided can we replicate this with existing sensors can we create a quantum sensor that does

155
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,440
the same thing yeah that these birds are doing to detect the earth's magnetic field and they

156
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,360
succeeded as of six years ago they created what's called a dark ice magnetometer so with these

157
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,000
magnetometers they can navigate anywhere on earth without a gps with gps precision they don't need

158
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,160
a satellite they can be underwater they can be wherever the hell they want and they can that's

159
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,200
pretty amazing right all sorts of issues national security vulnerabilities with gps satellites for

160
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,240
sure for sure and then if you don't have access to gps for whatever reason and imagine if you're

161
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,080
an extraterrestrial species visiting a new planet and you don't have access to gps magnetometer

162
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,120
that's it as we build more powerful quantum sensors we're going to be able to learn things

163
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,040
about the human body that will actually be medically useful there's already research being

164
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,800
done and devices being built for sensing the heart and like the activity of each you know

165
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,080
basically atom in the heart right so imagine having atomic resolution into the human body

166
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:25,840
wow these are this is what's going to happen right it's inevitable you see all of la so that's west

167
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,760
hollywood right here downtown all the way east right there and then you can see the beach during

168
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:40,320
the day all the way what yeah it's beautiful i think your blog is fascinating and i want to

169
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,360
go through some of your blog posts because i think the the titles themselves i think are worthy of

170
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,600
explanation so i'm just going to go through a couple of them and you can sort of give me

171
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:56,320
the summary if that works sure okay the evolution of science and the interactive universe so

172
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,480
when we look at the modern scientific method right it was invented by the credit gosus or

173
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,480
francis bacon his assumption the scientific method naturally assumes that whatever you

174
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,200
are deriving about the universe should be repeatable right and if it's not repeatable

175
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:19,600
if it's not testable and controlled then it's not scientific and it's not useful information

176
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,440
the issue with that is that it assumes that the universe is static that if i were to measure a

177
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:31,360
certain volume of air that it will never change if i measure the the particle composition of this

178
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,240
air nothing ever changes the the repeatability is there because the laws of physics are the same and

179
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,960
so on so forth nothing will ever affect my measurements other than the errors i already

180
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,080
know the the fundamental issue with sir francis bacon is assumption was that as commander favor

181
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,480
flies through the air that air the composition everything about it should be repeatable however

182
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,920
that day something happened that was not repeatable the existence of the tic tac so somewhere in that

183
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:05,280
air was this anomaly this thing that does not and is not repeatable yet it was clearly something

184
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,960
that needs to be studied so the scientific method needs a modification and that's what

185
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,880
this article is about that yeah it well yeah another model of science and this is maybe like

186
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,640
a kunian model is that there are anomalies that don't go like we're talking about quantum field

187
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,840
theory like you had black body radiation in the 1860s discovered by some german guy and it didn't

188
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,520
make any sense you'd expect sort of you know uh runaway heat in this in this black body or whatever

189
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,000
if you were talking about kind of a typical newtonian system and that wasn't the case we

190
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,520
figured out mathematically why that wasn't the case when max planck figured that out you know

191
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,360
that that that light was actually quantized in the early 20th century right but you have these

192
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,520
things where it's like little little pokes in the formal convention of the time and the standard

193
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,680
paradigm and you're like what is that doesn't quite make sense it doesn't quite make sense

194
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,600
and i love that there's a carl popper line it's called materialist promissory notes and it's you

195
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,480
know all the gaps of materialist reductionism will get filled in inevitably but but um that in

196
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,760
itself takes faith and so i think i think studying anomalies is incredibly important

197
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,320
absolutely and should be should be seen as a possibly a harbinger of the next paradigm

198
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,440
absolutely and and and not shoved away and not i mean i think we're over indexed on like people

199
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,160
like michael schermer like justifying the current paradigm that doesn't move science forward that's

200
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,240
not exciting at all it doesn't it also doesn't face reality i really believe in you know as

201
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,080
cheesy as it sounds facing reality if we're realizing that the scientific method is not

202
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:55,280
giving us uh the full picture we should be looking at new methods too that complement

203
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:02,800
right science as well because we know now at least no we have good indications that the universe is

204
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:10,560
indeed not static as in if i were to measure something there is a non-zero chance some crazy

205
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,960
anomaly that has never been properly characterized will occur in my measurement in my experiment

206
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,160
and we need to be able to quantify that somehow we need to account for it we have to be comfortable

207
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,000
with the fact that maybe when we study the abyss it steadies us back

208
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,200
okay

209
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,400
one of the interesting things we've been talking about like physics with uaps but what i find very

210
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,920
interesting is if you look at all into the subject it's not just new physics or if it is new physics

211
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,240
there's one component that doesn't fit with our current model of physics outside of the

212
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,080
observables of the actual uaps being very weird and that's that certain people see the uaps and

213
00:20:52,080 --> 00:21:00,080
those people see the certain uaps often in various states true and so again the ockham's razor easy

214
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,640
way to explain that away is the person is crazy right but often these people have no mental health

215
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,000
history why do you think certain people see uaps and is there science that we'll discover

216
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,360
that might be able to explain that i have two answers right one is much more rational and

217
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,680
doesn't make me sound crazy the other one makes me sound completely let's start with the second

218
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:31,280
okay sure my lunatic answer is it's based on cellular automata so cellular automata is a

219
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,200
notion that comes from computer science and mathematics and it's the idea that you can create

220
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,480
highly complex highly emergent systems from very basic cells and very very basic rules right where

221
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,080
you just define um you know a couple cells on a grid and how they'll behave well whether they die

222
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,800
or not right this is where like conway's game of life comes and so on and then we see that if you

223
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:00,000
let the simulation run and you let the play out you imagine you see this completely different

224
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,240
immersion phenomena right that's so complex my crazy theory is that these uap sightings that

225
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,560
we're seeing and so on are part of the cellular automata where individually they may seem like

226
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,400
one-offs and weird events but what we're experiencing could be part of this

227
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,880
essentially a game or strategy where the end goal is this very very complex emergent phenomenon

228
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,880
that cellular automata leads us to and i think that we're part of a more intelligent organism's

229
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,760
cellular automata game i guess if you will interesting i think that it's the whole point

230
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:48,160
is that is to change society towards a new state an emergent property like a very complex society

231
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,680
that we don't even have like we're not even near right now like we're we're getting pushed

232
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,640
towards it in ways that we don't even realize that's what's weird is it almost feels like

233
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,280
there's an arc of tech innovation or civilization civilizational progress or something that sure

234
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,800
it's like what you know why are there certain discoveries at the same time in places that

235
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,040
didn't have any contact with one another people were having sort of the same same thoughts at

236
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:22,400
the same time there's obviously you know esoteric traditions of kind of cyclical civilizations that

237
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,000
you know rose up and then they declined and it's i don't it's all very hard to explain but maybe

238
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,440
maybe tech is more pre-ordained than we than we think it is or maybe per like the william james

239
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,720
transmission theory of consciousness these things are sort of zapped into us and all ideas are kind

240
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,080
of zapped into us okay let's go through some more blogs we have resolving key issues in quantum

241
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,920
mechanics while simultaneously debunking every ufo case in history i love that is that yeah so

242
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:58,880
that was just an april fools prank okay okay curiosity as a time capsule what is that awesome

243
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:07,040
so that's where i lay out my predictions for where i think uap research is going that was

244
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:14,240
my version of a time capsule so that one day the hope is that you know five years 10 years

245
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,800
20 years from now as we develop a deeper understanding of what uaps are and the ecosystem

246
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,400
around it what it means or where that's going to leave us so that's what that yeah what are

247
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:34,720
your predictions um my prediction is that over the next 10 years i think that we will have

248
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,560
collected enough scientific evidence enough groups will have collaborated and worked together

249
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,400
and also post-scientific groups too right like i mentioned when you make some modifications to

250
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,040
scientific method i think that we're going to be stay in a decade from now where we acknowledge

251
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,600
that we are not the only life forms that are intelligent and super intelligent on this planet

252
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,280
i vaguely believe that failure and that would be an insane thing say we all were like okay so we

253
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:08,400
have scientific verification that aliens are you know i have a basis somewhere whatever uh all of

254
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,960
a sudden you replace angels and demons in the bible with aliens and you're like okay that was

255
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,160
probably real right and like a lot of that stuff might be happening now and actually my cousin who

256
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,880
had a vision you know or whatever like maybe he really did have a vision and they had something

257
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,560
to tell him and and all of a sudden the world becomes much more magical place totally and it's

258
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,400
not just these like folkloric funny stories that people are telling in the form of religion that

259
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,320
people think you know it's just the sort of garden variety thing that you do you show up it's for the

260
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,760
community whatever but it's ultimately there's no metaphysical truth in it and then there's science

261
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,520
which is like cold and amoral but it's it's real somehow this would marry those two things in this

262
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,120
like freaky way it's amazing it would be kind of crazy but i i don't know if it's happening

263
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:03,280
it's inevitable it is inevitable there are too many anomalies that are being reported and that

264
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:09,680
are being measured and observed around the world that for us to ignore you know that relates to

265
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,680
almost religious like experiences right yeah um i think that it's night it would be so painfully

266
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,800
naive of us and it is to conclude that we know everything there is about the universe where

267
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,920
we're so close that we can say that there's no such thing as like you know aliens for example

268
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,640
right like think about our quantum mechanics and general relativity that describes five percent of

269
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,200
the damn universe yeah the other 95 isn't even describable with our physics yeah right like yet

270
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,880
people are so damn confident about their worldview yeah it's crazy i think they mistake the map for

271
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,240
the territory it's because a love it yes that's exactly it that's brilliant what would you be

272
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,440
working on if it wasn't quantum computing if quantum computers didn't exist i would definitely

273
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:01,440
be an artificial intelligence do you think ai will ever get to a point where it's generative

274
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,520
and a human doesn't need to feed it some ideal end state that it's sort of judging it off yes yes

275
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,280
it will be when our fundamental machine learning models are better and improved and we go beyond

276
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,600
the neural networks of today and when they have their own physical body because that's what

277
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,200
they're missing is the ability to actually interact with the world around them where i

278
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,120
would disagree with like elon musk or nick bostrom or those those that camp of people is like they

279
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,080
seem to have these like doomsday scenarios in their head that are like near term where like

280
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:39,360
these like sentient killer robots decide that you know human meat space is useless

281
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,080
and you know or they don't fit into some objective function and then we end up getting thrown out

282
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,000
and killed and where we are now which is like statistics on steroids to that just feels like

283
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,200
this insane leap of logic and i actually think the more insidious narrative is that ai is already

284
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,840
killing us but ai is just consumer apps and consumer apps are eating us uh our brains

285
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,480
i think it's brilliant no that's a very very wise insight because most people who

286
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,720
use tiktok for example right yes they have no freaking clue yes how much they are being

287
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,320
manipulated by an artificial intelligence no idea the extent of it why she ain't put the news at

288
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,880
the bottom then that's disgusting so imagine you know we already saw problems with facebook when

289
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,240
people were experimenting with facebook's news feed to see how it affect people's mood and then

290
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,560
you know alleged suicides and deaths would increase during this the results of this

291
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,720
experimentation right how do we know that's not also happening with tiktok and other

292
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,320
outlets and so on yeah so absolutely there's an insidious aspect of ai that we should worry about

293
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,560
that's outside i think so too i think it's killing us with a whimper not with a bang

294
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,240
love it that's just eating eating away at us sort of parasitically

295
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,400
quantum computers in the next like let's say to be conservative 15 years i will i'm being highly

296
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:04,640
conservative there will become powerful enough to completely make rsa obsolete rsa encryption is

297
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,560
the backbone of society right it's it's what allows you to securely access your bank account

298
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,520
to send messages you could reverse engineer that with quantum computing exactly that will happen

299
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,360
it is not a matter of if but when so you could double spend bitcoin you could double the whole

300
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:28,160
all of these yeah most of these cryptocurrencies today will become obsolete because of quantum

301
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,200
computing well that's an interesting sort of black swan event around crypto it will happen

302
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,760
yeah totally and it's gonna get a lot of people will get blindsided and caught blindsided in that

303
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,360
absolutely interesting absolutely and so what happens when there are nation-state actors or

304
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,160
people who are intelligent enough that can build quantum computers and suddenly the whole world's

305
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,640
information is exposed right what happens if i can read your facebook messages now that you've

306
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,560
sent throughout your whole life right how disturbing would that be so um i think that

307
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:05,760
that that event alone will force society the apocalypse exactly or like force us to work

308
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,880
together basically like because like everybody will lose their leverage right at the same time

309
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,360
yeah well dude thank you for doing this this is a lot of fun absolutely likewise jesse yeah

310
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,360
thanks deep it was such a pleasure man we'll do this again sometime we'll definitely do this again

311
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:29,680
dude in miami absolutely yes
