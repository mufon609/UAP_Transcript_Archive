1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Our technology is well ahead of what people know, because where I was, right place, right time, I saw some of that.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You occasionally still work at Area 51, right?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We call it the test site or the test range. Area 51 is just one component of that entire huge sprawling compound.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
During that time, a green orb-type object had flown over, and that was where the weird shit started.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We moved on down another hallway and it had a marking on the wall and said, off-world technology.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's insane.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The metallic, basketball-sized sphere looked like it was just levitating above the podium.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It looked unnatural. I'm looking at it and it almost looked like a mirage type of effect.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And above that display screen were these hieroglyphic symbols that I started to see appear.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is encoded in something deeper.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Way deeper.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Welcome to maybe the most mind-blowing interview we've ever done at American Alchemy.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's with a green beret named Randy Anderson.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Randy is an American badass.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He's a complete physical specimen, having completed the notorious SEER and Q Special Forces qualification courses,

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
both of which have very high failure rates.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He's also an 18 Bravo Special Forces weapons sergeant who knows how to operate just about every gun under the sun.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He wouldn't let me bring this up in our interview because of how much he cares about maintaining a humble, quiet green beret attitude,

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
but there's a lot more I can say about Randy's battlefield accomplishments.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Out of respect for him, I will leave that a mystery for you to speculate on.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But why are we talking about Randy now, and why has he agreed to go on record?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, for the purposes of this episode and our channel, which covers the nature of reality,

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
in March of 2014, Randy was taken to a secret underground facility called the Off-World Technology Division at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What he saw there changed his view of American technological capabilities and his worldview and understanding of humanity and its place in the universe forever.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And now it might change your understanding of all of these things as well.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thank you so much for being here.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I just can't tell you how much of an honor and privilege it is to be trusted with telling your story.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's one of the most profound, interesting stories I've ever heard.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And I've heard, given what I do, a lot of crazy stuff out there.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And I think we both are aware of the fact that 2025 is going to be a pretty crazy year.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I think a lot of stuff is coming down the pike.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And, you know, if there was ever a time for you to come out with your story, I think now would be it.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And so we've been having conversations about that, and I just feel honored to be here right now.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I think this is an amazing moment.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And thank you.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Absolutely, man.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're the guy that's out there doing it, man.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're putting the story out there.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're telling people what's up, bringing awareness to it.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And I think that's key.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And that's why I wanted to do this with you.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And we have a mutual friend.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He goes by UAP Gerb.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He has an incredible channel and he introduced us.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And so I just want to start off by giving him a huge shout out because he's one of the deepest researchers I've ever met when it comes to this topic.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I was thoroughly impressed with the amount of stuff he dug up on the place that I did the training at.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Absolutely.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It was wild.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So shout out to Gerb.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And I know you're going to be doing a follow up with him.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And so, yeah, I just want to want to express my gratitude there.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But let's get into your story because I think in some ways you are an ordinary American and then in other ways you're an extraordinary American.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And so I want to get into the ordinary elements.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Where did you grow up and what were you like as a kid?

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, yeah.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is where I was born and raised for the first 10 years of my life.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We moved to Las Vegas when I was pretty young and like 10, 11 years old.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And I grew up there the rest of my life.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So I did back and forth for a while with family.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So most of my family is still back there.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And then most of my young childhood teenage years were all in Las Vegas.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And did you know that you ended up having this really impressive, amazing thank you for your service, by the way, career in special forces?

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Did you know you wanted to get into that as a kid?

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No, I thought I wanted to be a Navy SEAL because that's what everybody knows about.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And I thought that was what the coolest thing you could do in the military at the time.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And but I also wanted to be a fireman.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That type of work always is what appealed to me when I was a kid, like any typical young American boy.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You ended up becoming a Green Beret and a lot of people know about Navy SEALs.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There are a lot of public Navy SEALs out there.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You have David Goggins, you know, people like that, you know, doing podcast circuit sort of stuff all the time.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Green Berets are much less well known and they're sort of a rivalry at times between between the two.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, we like it. We like it that way.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We like being the true quiet professionals.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I mean, it's a cultural thing. It's a cultural difference.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I wouldn't say anything negative about the SEALs.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They're a very professional organization.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's just culturally and in special forces, Army Special Forces particularly.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's it's not very popular to talk about what you do.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's why this is super uncomfortable for me to talk about it publicly.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But I think this is important enough to do it.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
At what point did you become a Green Beret?

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, so well, when I was young, I was testing for the fire department in Las Vegas.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I got hired for the fire department really young, 19 years old, and I did that for a few years.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And in my early 20s, I was kind of feeling stagnant.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I was a very motivated young man, and I always challenged myself to do the best I could.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I was valedictorian of my fire department academy, firefighter academy, and I just felt like I was kind of getting stagnant.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I was working at the busiest firehouse in the country.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I was fighting fires all the time, but I felt like I wanted to do more.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The war was raging in the Middle East, and I was thinking still about that childhood dream of becoming a Navy SEAL.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And I started looking into it and how I could do it without telling anybody.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I kind of kept it a secret. I was married at the time, too.

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So my wife's the only one at the time that knew that I was looking into it because I said to make sure she was cool with it.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So I started digging in and finding out more about the Navy SEALs and talk to a SEAL recruiter.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
During that time, another friend of mine who was a firefighter for a sister department in Henderson, Nevada, which is right in Las Vegas,

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
he told me that he was a SEAL or a MARSOC guy.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He was, what do they call it, a corpsman for the Navy, worked with MARSOC and the SEALs.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And he told me to look into green berets. He said he thought it would fit my personality better.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And he told me a little bit about what they do.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And I was like, that sounds really cool.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So I looked into it and didn't know much about it before that.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And I was like, that is definitely more of a fit for my personality and what I want to do.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
They do kind of everything. Unconventional warfare, anything from counter drug to counterterrorism.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Unconventional warfare is like going in with a guerrilla force and overthrowing a tyrannical government, for example.

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So that just seemed like a really cool, noble thing, mission to me.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And so it resonated with me and I pursued it and luckily made it.

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How old were you at the time?

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I was like 25.

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay. And what was the main distinction?

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Because you said you grew up wanting to be a Navy SEAL.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Why did you decide green beret over Navy SEAL?

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What's the main distinction between the two?

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
As I dug into both of the careers, Navy SEALs, there's movies out there and there's books out there.

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Green berets didn't have a lot of information. I had to really dig to find out.

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And I thought that right there was cool to me.

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I didn't want to do it to get some kind of accolade or recognition.

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I wanted to do it because it was doing the right thing and helping be part of the solution and fighting at the tip of the spear, I felt like.

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So that's why I was drawn to it.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
How intense was the initial training?

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It was pretty brutal, as you can imagine.

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Any of that type of training that's going to weed out 90% of the people, it's pretty brutal.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You go through all your basic training and all that stuff.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And then you go through a selection phase, which is pretty difficult.

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And the last part of that phase is team week and you're broken and beaten.

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I mean, everybody's got stress fractures.

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And I think I had hundreds of stress fractures in my feet by the end of it.

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And, you know, you're just you're still moving 20, 30 mile movements, you know, throughout the day and carrying an exorbitant amount of weight, like I think 175, 180 pounds through soft sand.

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's just brutal.

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I mean, there's a lot of stuff out there on the Internet about it.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And but that's probably one of the more difficult physically demanding phases.

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But during the course, you have language phase.

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You got to learn a foreign language.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You got to be fluent.

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You have six months to do that.

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's difficult to do.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You know any foreign languages?

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah, I speak Indonesian and Malaysian.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's amazing.

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah.

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Indonesian is not an easy language to learn.

141
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's actually fairly easy.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It is.

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, it actually.

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's sort of very I'm going to use this word incorrectly, but almost interoperable.

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Like it's I have a old colleague named Eric Weinstein who always talks about how Indonesians actually easy to pick up because it's like a few different core variables or something that account for the rest of the language.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's fairly easy.

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The alphabet's identical.

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The sounds are slightly different, but it's any language is a lot of block memorization and then understanding like how you relate it to your native language.

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Are there any things that you saw deployed in the field that, you know, made you think twice as far as American capabilities or adversary capabilities, just technology in the warfare context where you're like, I didn't know that that existed.

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
100%.

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah.

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So I think our technology is well ahead of what people know.

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I mean, I know it's well ahead of what people understand or think where we are significantly.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And I because just where I was right place, right time, I saw some of that.

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And yeah, there's there's technology out there that I think would blow people's minds if they knew that we had that capability.

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And any examples?

158
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah, the drone technology we have is pretty significantly better than people think.

159
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Right now, as we speak, there's this mystery drone craze.

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I would say clearly that some of these are not manmade, but, you know, that depends on your priors and understanding of a lot of the kind of weirder stuff.

161
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But what did you see and what do you think we are capable of on the on the drone front?

162
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I think what we're seeing, just my opinion, we're seeing our technology and drones respond to something that's not ours.

163
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Are there any drones disguising themselves as other objects that seem prosaic?

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Have you seen anything like that?

165
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes, there there there's technology that can be disguised to look like ordinary things that are drones and ISR surveillance type platforms.

166
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's pretty amazing. And so are the things I'm assuming the things themselves are not shape shifting.

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
They are not that I saw. Yeah, they're creating a signature that resembles something more kind of ordinary.

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, it's it's there to make you think of something else.

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I mean, it looks like a local thing that would be normal to anybody who lives in the area.

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So there's like a funny protest movement run by this like trolling kid on social media and it's like birds aren't real.

171
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's like that the birds are all like, you know, CIA spooks or something.

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I mean, hilariously accurate.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's wild. So you think that there are drones that can maybe mimic.

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I mean, even in DARPA, their initiatives towards biomimicry and like a lot of biological designs have actually inspired aircraft design.

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But we're kind of taking this a step farther and saying that certain reconnaissance devices actually look like and appear to look like the animal like birds.

176
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why wouldn't it? Why wouldn't that be a natural way of disguising your your technology or which you're trying to monitor someone without them knowing you're monitoring them?

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah, anything natural in the environment is is where you want to hide that.

178
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So it's pretty it's pretty intense.

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You also have worked and occasionally still work at Area 51, right?

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The kind of legendary flight testing site, I think, was created in the 1950s, mainly actually to test, I think, originally the YouTube.

181
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But then, you know, other exotic aircraft on up from there.

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Just recently, another green beret was in the news under more unfortunate circumstances.

183
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Matthew Livelsberger executed a stranger than fiction car bombing, but with fireworks and a cyber truck in front of Trump Tower in Las Vegas on New Year's Day 2025.

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:10,000
After the incident, podcaster Sean Ryan had a guest on named Sam Shoemate, claiming that Matthew had emailed him, saying that the New Jersey drones that the entire country has been confused about for the last two months

185
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
are actually state of the art gravitic propulsion drones from China.

186
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Controversy ensued, but Sean Ryan and Shoemate have now been vindicated by the FBI.

187
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It looks like this email was, in fact, sent by Livelsberger, the Las Vegas bomber.

188
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Having said that, I don't think we should wholesale accept all of the contents of this email.

189
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Chinese electro-gravitic drones carrying large payloads that could vaporize New York or D.C. at the drop of a hat, hovering with impunity around civilian airspace, feels hard to believe, or at the very least, should be further investigated and not just accepted at face value.

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But here's where I probably break from the consensus.

191
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I am confident that the U.S. and probably China have at least cracked anti-gravity in laboratory settings.

192
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I know that sounds insane, but if you don't believe me, check out my videos on the great mid-century inventor Thomas Townsend Brown and with aviation journalist Nick Cook.

193
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:17,000
There's an abundance of open source evidence out there that we can affect gravity in clear ways with high voltage electricity.

194
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But I digress. How does any of this tie together with Randy's story?

195
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Well, the crazy connection here is this very weird email sent by Matthew displays the coordinates of America's Gravitic Propulsions Operations Center.

196
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The coordinates are at Area 51. Now, this alone doesn't prove anything.

197
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You can Google Area 51's coordinates.

198
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The reason this is interesting is because Randy, who is also a Green Beret in our interview subject today, has worked at Area 51.

199
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And he told me off air that he's seen a black triangle hovering around at the notorious flight testing facility that he believed was employing exotic electro-gravitic propulsion.

200
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What has that experience been like?

201
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Anybody that works out of that area, we call it the test site or the test range.

202
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Area 51 is just one component of that entire huge sprawling compound base area.

203
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's testing range where they tested the first some of the first nukes, you know, and it's a really cool place to check out historically.

204
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I mean, that that's one of the coolest things I think about it is seeing those sites where they detonate nukes, where they had the Marines like embedded right next to where the explosions were going off and they were dug in.

205
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And you can literally see the area where the explosion happened and where they were dug in and benches where people sat and watched nuclear explosions go off and didn't realize how much danger they were in at the time.

206
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I actually just did a piece with this guy, Robert Hastings, who wrote an amazing book called UFOs and Nukes.

207
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And this guy documents 167 whistleblowers, guys who are cleared to some of our most sensitive stuff.

208
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And they're basically tasked with guarding the crown jewels of American defense and our nuclear assets.

209
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And they're screened for being the picture of mental health.

210
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
In certain cases, they have their finger on the nuclear button.

211
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And so they have to be on what's called the PRP program and report if they're taking ibuprofen for God's sake.

212
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
They're very of sound mind.

213
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And they consistently report seeing UFOs showing up not only in and around nuclear assets, but actually in and around the plume of nuclear blasts and atmospheric tests.

214
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And a lot of these guys are older.

215
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So I think atmospheric tests were banned at some point mid-century.

216
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So if this was going on in Area 51, you have to think that that's got to be a very interesting place as far as maybe UFO activity as well.

217
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Well, sure. And I mean, I always wondered, too, because obviously it's a great place to test technology because there's not a lot of eyes on it.

218
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So it makes sense that that's what they use it for.

219
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And obviously that's what they did.

220
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The SR-71, F-117 were programs I think were heavily tested out there.

221
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And I'm sure a lot of the exotic tech is tested out there as well.

222
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But then there's also the stuff that we don't quite know what it is that's showing up.

223
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And I think it's incredibly interesting and personally, I mean, being out there.

224
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So my role out there is to help as an opposition force for some units that are training for operations overseas.

225
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And that's about as deep as I can go into it.

226
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's nothing super cool.

227
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's fun, cool guys stuff to do for guys like us, guys like me that like to shoot guns and get in a gunfight or pretend gunfight in this case.

228
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And get to run into old buddies of mine that I worked with in special forces teams.

229
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So it's cool.

230
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And while out there, we have had a couple crazy incidents.

231
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll speak to one in particular just because I don't think it's too crazy to speak about.

232
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But basically, I brought some of the guys out with me.

233
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
We're operating under somebody's cue clearance while out there.

234
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:21,000
One of the commanders of the unit that was coming in by helicopter unit landed in one of the cadre that oversees their movement and kind of grading them on their performance and evaluating was standing next to some of my guys.

235
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And during that time, a green orb type object had flown over and my buddy had seen it and he looked up at the cadre that was there and mentioned if he asked him if he had seen it.

236
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And he said he looked down on my buddy and said, are you sure you saw that?

237
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And my friend was like, yeah, I saw it as green or me says, because if you did see it, we got a lot of paperwork to do.

238
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And my buddy kind of got the hint and he said, yeah, maybe I didn't see it.

239
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And he's like, that's better.

240
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And they kind of brushed it off.

241
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So they obviously either knew what it was or knew not to talk about it.

242
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah.

243
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And I don't know either or.

244
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I mean, we sign NDAs and stuff going out there.

245
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So, you know, there's not much more we say about it, but it was interesting.

246
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And I've seen a couple of things like that out there in my time working out there that are definitely cool.

247
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Well, the lack of shock on behalf of that officer, I think, says it all.

248
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Right.

249
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It seems kind of like a routine thing for him to have seen.

250
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
In fact, there was a meteor expert at the University of New Mexico named Lincoln La Paz.

251
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And in 1948, 49, he was basically studying green fireballs following the plume radioactive debris post nuclear blasts across the U.S.

252
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
There's another guy, a researcher named Dan Wilson, who was also following up on this line of research.

253
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And so I think that's actually a fairly common thing when it comes to ufology and UFOs.

254
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And Lou Elizondo has also spoken about green fireballs.

255
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And in fact, I've seen a green fireball with Lou Elizondo.

256
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That's crazy, man.

257
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Now you're mentioning that.

258
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What was that?

259
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
We were hanging out at Lou's place, actually, in Wyoming.

260
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And Lou was it was kind of later at night.

261
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We were like by his shed, just hanging out.

262
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And Lou is going deep on and for basically for the audience for who might need context on this.

263
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Lou Elizondo is a guy who ran the official UFO investigation program under Harry Reid.

264
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's called ASAP kind of, I guess, morphed into this program called ATIP.

265
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And and he's since come out and kind of blown the whistle on some stuff around UFOs.

266
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And so, yeah, we're hanging out at his house and he's going deep on how the sun is this nuclear fusion reactor and specifically how it works and stuff.

267
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And then all of a sudden we just see it's hard to kind of place distance on these things, but we see this green fireball just shoot out into the sky.

268
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And we're just like, well, like this couldn't be weirder as far as what this what we're talking about, who we're with and seeing this happen.

269
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So, dude, like I know for a fact for me, since since my experience, I've definitely seen more stuff than I mean, I didn't see anything before that and I never noticed.

270
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Maybe I wasn't looking, but now I see shit all the time.

271
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That feels like the dirty little secret in UFO world because it feels like a lot of people downplay their personal experiences because they want to maintain this like impartiality of like I'm this perfect scientist.

272
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But the more you notice the thing, the more it does start to happen to you.

273
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And the deeper you get, you have a couple of drinks with, you know, anybody in this field, they start to say, yeah, things have gotten kind of trippy.

274
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Once I've started to look into this, which makes sense.

275
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Right. Like you have the video of like, you know, I think this like gorilla going across this video.

276
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And if you're not focused on the grill, you don't see the grill.

277
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You know, so your attention is somehow fundamental to what you experience in life.

278
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So that sounds like that's happened with you as well.

279
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's probably that same phenomenon.

280
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Like you buy a red car and then you see red cars or whatever, you know, whatever type of car you buy.

281
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You see that type of car all of a sudden everywhere.

282
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Exactly.

283
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Maybe it's just that we're looking now and we're more aware of it.

284
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So we're seeing it.

285
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah.

286
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Tony Robbins, I think, was interviewed by Theo Vaughn and he was like, notice everything red in the room.

287
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And if you were to do that right now, you notice everything red in the room.

288
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And then you close your eyes.

289
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh yeah, I remember this.

290
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What did you see that was brown?

291
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What did you see that was brown?

292
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You wouldn't really remember, but you would remember the red thing.

293
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So yeah, I think it's yeah.

294
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Anyways, it's super fascinating, but that's wild.

295
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So you experienced that firsthand at Area 51.

296
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Any other technology?

297
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I mean, one area that might be worthy of discussion is one of the top five episodes for Joe Rogan.

298
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And the subject of a lot of mythology and lore and UFO world is Bob Lazar, who claimed to work at Area 51, a special compartment of it called S4.

299
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Nobody knew what Area 51 was before Bob Lazar came out.

300
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And so a lot of people are like, his story is totally legit.

301
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
By the way, he claimed to basically work on reverse engineering UFOs.

302
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Right.

303
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And he's all sorts of interesting stuff like element 115, which is a stable version of muscovium, was used for the propulsion.

304
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
He talks about gravity A, gravity B.

305
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But he also was shown things about bodies being containers of souls and just all sorts of trippy out there.

306
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's wild, man.

307
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah, so like I've dug more into this stuff just since the experience.

308
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And I mean, it's I don't know about Bob Lazar's story, if it's true or not.

309
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I mean, it seems like he's telling the truth.

310
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It seems genuine.

311
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But I don't know.

312
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I don't know if you're going to talk about your theory on that, but I think that's pretty I think that's pretty cool, man.

313
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And I lean into that pretty heavily as far as like, that's probably what's going on.

314
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah, I don't know.

315
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm happy to say it.

316
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I think you should.

317
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, yeah, I mean, well, I want to focus this back on you.

318
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You're the real guest of honor.

319
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But I will I think that Bob Lazar was kind of a limited hangout of a person.

320
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And so what I mean by that is he would provide high level frameworks where, you know, it's like that cicada challenge or whatever for the NSA or something.

321
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Or is the NSA or CIA or something like if you have a really impressive mathematical and like puzzle, you know, piecing ability or whatever online, you get it and you get recruited or whatever.

322
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And so Bob Lazar comes out, he says gravity, a gravity B says all these things about, you know, stable versions of these, you know, elements that like we're not aware of.

323
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And if you investigate that and jump the bar to the, you know, where you show a level of prowess or ability with these highly technical concepts and actually kind of read the tea leaves on them, then maybe you get recruited to the program.

324
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The reason why I think this is important for you to bring up, the reason I dug into that a little bit with you is because this type of stuff happens throughout the military as well.

325
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And so I'd like to give an example of that if I could.

326
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah.

327
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And also because I think it ties into maybe possibly why I was exposed to what I was exposed to.

328
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Okay.

329
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So and I'll bring that full circle.

330
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But there was one point in the Q course.

331
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And again, the Q course is a training program to become a Green Beret.

332
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
They randomly, and this isn't uncommon, so it didn't strike me as odd at the beginning of this.

333
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
They just told us we're going to do a run.

334
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And they said just run until you're told to stop, do your best, right?

335
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's a common way of them evaluating you.

336
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You don't know how far you're going to go.

337
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Do your best.

338
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That's a difficult, that adds a level of stress.

339
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Okay.

340
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And that's what they're trying to do in a lot of these cases.

341
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So you start running, running down a path, a soft sand trail, which sucks to run on.

342
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And during the run, I remember as I'm going along the route, the trees had something posted on trees as I was running.

343
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And one tree had like a face posted, like an image, a headshot of somebody.

344
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I noticed it.

345
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And then another tree had a red seven.

346
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Another tree had a blue three.

347
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Another tree had another face.

348
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And so there's just every so often another tree had something posted on it.

349
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And so I'm mentally noting this like significant for some reason.

350
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yes.

351
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And at the end of the run, it just ended up being like a six mile run for time.

352
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
People that did well on the run got sectioned off.

353
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
People who didn't got sectioned off.

354
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And people who did well on the run got brought to an area where we took a test.

355
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And the test was all the red numbers add, all the green numbers subtract.

356
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And which faces did you see?

357
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And so you go through and you do this quick test.

358
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And then people that did well on the test sectioned off and so on.

359
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And it was an evaluation for another unit in the military above these units.

360
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And so they do that.

361
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
They do that kind of stuff often, at least in the military.

362
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So I don't see why an agency like the CIA wouldn't recruit people the same type of way.

363
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Makes sense.

364
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Evaluate you without you being realized you're being evaluated.

365
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You're going to get genuine good people or good at what you're looking for them to be good at.

366
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Totally.

367
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yeah.

368
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And it's not enough to tip the hat to the adversary and might even throw them off the trail in a sense.

369
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
But to some initiated elite person, then all of a sudden you get into the program or something.

370
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And so yeah, I think those type of tests happen often, especially in the military.

371
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And especially at the level of special operations.

372
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I think they're looking for guys that display certain characteristics to do other work.

373
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yep.

374
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And if they identify that, then you end up.

375
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And I think maybe that's why I ended up where I ended up seeing what I saw.

376
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Maybe something triggered something that they said, let's see.

377
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And that happened.

378
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So why don't we set this up for the audience?

379
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
What is Naval Surface Warfare Crane and why were you there to begin with?

380
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah, so I didn't have any particular knowledge about that.

381
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I just ended up being the place where we were doing this training.

382
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
This particular course was to do some advanced weapons training.

383
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
My job in Special Forces was in 18 Bravo.

384
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
18 Bravos are your weapon sergeant on the team.

385
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And your responsibility is to be proficient on hundreds of different types of weapon systems, foreign and domestic weapon systems.

386
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:15,000
That's everything from handguns, rifles up to rocket launchers and recoilless rifles, mortars, any type of manpower weapon system.

387
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So you can work over like a hundred weapons yourself.

388
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh, yeah.

389
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Wow.

390
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I mean, but it's what you do.

391
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
That's what your focus is.

392
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So this was just another course.

393
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And one of the focuses of this particular training was the Mark 44 minigun.

394
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's a somewhat complicated weapon system.

395
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So it requires an extra level of training.

396
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And we were there going over that.

397
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The SCAR had a new iteration of it.

398
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And we were going over that.

399
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So just just going over special operations.

400
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So calm weapons and and more advanced training, like becoming an armor on some of those weapon systems, which allows you to do a higher level of care and maintenance for the team.

401
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Were you there with a unit?

402
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I was there with a group of guys.

403
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Some guys there were armors for their unit, some tier one units, some special operations units.

404
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Some guys were a couple of other green berets.

405
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
There were only a few of us, me and one other guy that ended up exposed to what we're exposed to.

406
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And so, yeah, I'm going to want to show you this.

407
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah.

408
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I think it's important to the validity of what I'm saying.

409
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So I don't know how you want to.

410
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah. Well, for the for the intense skeptic out there, you have Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division and Randy Anderson.

411
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So there you go.

412
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And it's in my DD-214 as well, which is provided you with.

413
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And it's in your what? My DD-214.

414
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
DD-214. OK, so that's your record.

415
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah. Everything done in the military is documented there.

416
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So you were clear you were there.

417
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
By all intents and purposes, man, it was it was a normal actually kind of run down facility.

418
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It was it's a huge crane.

419
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Indiana is in the middle of freaking nowhere.

420
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And it's also known for its naval readiness in general, right?

421
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It's part of the NAVSEA program.

422
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And I've heard I don't know if this is true or comports with your understanding, but that there's some coordination between Crane and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

423
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It makes sense based on some of the stuff that happened.

424
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And there's also a civilian company that was tied to it that's tied to some exotic stuff as well.

425
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So kind of dig into that and see.

426
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Well, there's SAIC.

427
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That's a very interesting contractor with some history in that area.

428
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And I've also I'm friends with actually Navy Special Warfare guy.

429
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And he'll say some pretty interesting stuff to me.

430
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
He'll say, like, the Air Force guys, those guys talk.

431
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And he's like, the Navy guys, they never speak and they experience way more weird.

432
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
He was like, look at the tenure of nuclear Navy engineers.

433
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And he was like, tell me, like, that's not the highest churn job you've ever experienced.

434
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
He's like, those people are seeing crazy stuff underwater in these nuclear subs.

435
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And you think about it, you know, all the stuff around UFOs and nukes, people with Q clearances, they're above land.

436
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah, if you're in this contained vessel, terrifying, terrifying in some remote, you know, part of the world or whatever.

437
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And then you see, you know, some sort of non-human entity sort of try to disrupt your comms or shut shut down your power.

438
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I mean, right. I'm out. Right.

439
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
If I can't shoot it. Yeah.

440
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Pretty crazy. So you're doing like kind of combat training stuff at crane.

441
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yeah. Weapons training, weapons training.

442
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Then what happens a couple of days into the training?

443
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
We're doing really well. I mean, it's how we're doing very well.

444
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And we got pulled to the side at the end of the day on a regular training day.

445
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And we stayed after and we're talking with the cadre and instructors and they somebody else had come into the room.

446
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And we thought we maybe were just getting some extra stuff because we were doing well.

447
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And they ended up telling us we're going to go check out some foreign weapons.

448
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
We went to another part of the other facility, went to another building in that building, went into an elevator.

449
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:14,000
We took an elevator down, which that was the first odd thing is that it felt like we went down significantly further than like you'd think you would.

450
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I mean, it was just awkward. It just stood out. You went way underground.

451
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't know if it was way, but it was it was further down than like a few floors.

452
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You know, so I don't know how far I know how fast it was going.

453
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I didn't know I needed to pay attention to it at the time.

454
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It was just it's just something that stood out to me that it was we're going underground.

455
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And these are pretty well documented now across America, you know, underground military facilities.

456
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And so, OK, so you're going underground.

457
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Did you know that there was an underground complex at Crane before this?

458
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
OK, absolutely not. No, it wasn't briefed on it. They know about it.

459
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So what's going through your mind at this point?

460
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You're going down underground in an elevator with these random instructors.

461
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Well, at the end of the day, man, I'm a soldier and I do what I'm told.

462
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm just just following orders and just going and OK, we're going to go here, go stand there, do this.

463
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But I'm be I'm observing, you know, I'm kind of it's starting to feel different.

464
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
You know, the mood has definitely become more serious.

465
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You know, the people we're with were seem serious and me and the other guy were just being quiet and, you know,

466
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
not showing any emotion as we're trained to do.

467
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So we get under there, door opens, we go through a security type checkpoint.

468
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I remember the first thing that stood out to me was that it was significantly more modern than everything up top.

469
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Yeah, and that was odd.

470
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
The lighting and everything seemed more modern, just seemed more upkept.

471
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Yeah, kind of state of the art.

472
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It was very streamlined how things operated down there.

473
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So you could tell it was like very regimented, just like you walk on this.

474
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Everybody walked on the right side to go down the hall and people coming this way walking their right.

475
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's just there was like a line on the wall that you follow to different areas.

476
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You know how like the hospitals sometimes have like a line to follow to this, the emergency room.

477
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It was kind of that that seemed like it was that I mean, I wasn't 100 percent paying attention to that.

478
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I was just had observed it upon getting under there or getting down there.

479
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
We moved through a security checkpoint and then we started looking at some foreign weapons stuff.

480
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And they were telling us about some Russian and Chinese weapons systems that were captured.

481
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And I don't want to go too into the details and stuff.

482
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It's still within to kind of close proximity to that.

483
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Sure.

484
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That I don't I don't want to go too far.

485
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:45,000
But basically it was pretty advanced stuff that they had been using that was captured probably, I would assume, by agency types that were operating in the area and had come across stuff that it seemed exotic.

486
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It wasn't anything that would strike me as beyond what I'd expect us to find or people to have the capability of making.

487
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But it was it was interesting for sure.

488
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Just the type of ammunition and the way the weapon systems operated.

489
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It was there was some kind of kind of exotic, unconventional, unconventional.

490
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Yeah, I would say not so much exotic, but unconventional for sure.

491
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
OK.

492
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And so we talked about that for a little bit and they kind of felt like it was sort of evaluating our thoughts on it, maybe seeing, you know, we are weapons experts.

493
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And so maybe they just wanted another set of eyes on it and maybe just evaluating to see what what we came up with.

494
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Maybe they were evaluating us for see how what we could find out about.

495
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I don't know. I don't know. Right.

496
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You know, like I said, I've thought about this a lot.

497
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Maybe they knew and they were testing exactly they didn't know and they genuinely wanted your help.

498
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
There's a whole host of possibilities. Absolutely.

499
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And I don't want to say it was one of the I don't know.

500
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Sure. But again, we did that for a bit.

501
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And then at any point, did you say, hey, why are we down here?

502
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Just kind of. Yeah.

503
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And you wouldn't. Yeah.

504
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
That's not the way things are done.

505
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So you just do. Yeah, totally.

506
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And if you're ever like going to be denied access to the most interesting stuff, it's by asking questions like, yeah, probably.

507
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So I would bet you probably just want to kind of go with it at that point.

508
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
OK, so you're looking at this exotic or not exotic, but unconventional adversary technology.

509
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yes. And again, it was really interesting.

510
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And I think we came up with a couple ideas of what we thought about it and purpose and functionality.

511
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And then they kind of the two guys were with spoke for a little bit.

512
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And then we and almost and again, a lot of this is me trying to remember.

513
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And so I don't know if I'm getting everything perfect.

514
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
But in hindsight, looking back, I would assume maybe they were deciding if we're going to go further.

515
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah. And they ultimately decided we would, I guess, because we went down.

516
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Ended up going through another security checkpoint.

517
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
That was odd because we had already gone through a significant level of security.

518
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And so I thought that was odd.

519
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
This was more like going into a skiff. OK, what I would compare it to.

520
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And when you do that, I mean, everything gets you take your watch off and anything electronics gone.

521
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yep. So for the audience, skiff is secret compartmentalized information facility.

522
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Yeah. And it's basically it's like a Faraday cage on steroids.

523
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So that any comms that take place within the skiff are completely offline.

524
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Anything that goes into the skiff can't come out, can't come out.

525
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And yeah, so it's just a very protected facility for a good reason.

526
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And so, yeah, it was it was that level of security, which is the highest level security I've seen or dealt with.

527
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And so that that was strange, too, because we'd already gone through a pretty robust security checkpoint to get under there.

528
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And are they checking your clearance at each point?

529
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
No, no, I mean, you're already that's already done when we got to the training.

530
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So they know who we are. Yeah.

531
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You know, and it was more just like, do you have anything right now on you?

532
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah, that's what it felt like. Like a TSA on steroids sort of situation.

533
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure.

534
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But yeah, and then you go through that, you put yourself in a box, it gets locked into a box.

535
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And then you go through another checkpoint area and scan and whatever else.

536
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Right. Not uncommon, but seemed highly unusual for for this.

537
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:23,000
After that, we moved on down another hallway and got into an area that had a marking on the wall and said off world technology.

538
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Said off world technology that.

539
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yeah, that's insane.

540
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So immediately that I mean, immediately my bells go off.

541
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Was it engraved or was it was it?

542
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
No, it was. Did it look like it was written in markers?

543
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
No, it was. But it wasn't like it was like permanent.

544
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It was like somebody like stuck a placard in kind of.

545
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
OK. You know, like, so I don't know, it could have been it could have been a setup.

546
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It could have been something just thrown together.

547
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
But it could have been something that's just how they had it said off world technology.

548
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Yeah, that obviously immediately.

549
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Started to feel what what the fuck is going on, right?

550
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah, so me and the guy are looking at each other.

551
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
The other guy that's there, he's another Green Beret.

552
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Like, you know, kind of giving each other that look.

553
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And yeah, we that was that was where the weird shit started.

554
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So, yeah, we go into into the room and the one room.

555
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
These significantly higher level of technology, like the lighting even looked.

556
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You know, everything was just it was more.

557
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Everything was it was just a different vibe, man.

558
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't know how else to describe it. Like I said, the lighting was different.

559
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
The walls had like maybe I would assume some type of Faraday material.

560
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Everything was just a higher level of detail.

561
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You know, the first object was a metallic basketball sized sphere.

562
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And it was above a podium.

563
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And it was looked like it was just levitating above the podium, levitating above the podium.

564
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So there was space between the sphere and the podium itself.

565
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
And I remember at one point, like trying to angle myself like, how is that?

566
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Do you think it could have been some sort of magnetic levitation?

567
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
OK, maybe. But it's just levitating there.

568
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It was just levitate. Did it look like a prosaic like like this wood table where if you were to, you know, touch it, it would act like a normal object.

569
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Did it look holographic? What did it look like?

570
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So, OK, this is that's a good question.

571
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Then what stood out to me was the the way the metal looked.

572
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It looked unnatural.

573
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And I talked with Gurb about this and he kind of dug in on this.

574
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I mean, I'm like, dude, I don't know how to describe it.

575
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
All I can tell you is it didn't look natural.

576
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
It didn't look like anything I could compare it to.

577
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Interesting. Yeah.

578
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So look, it didn't. It almost looked like off world.

579
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It fit the bill.

580
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And then also there was a I mean, and this could have been anxiety or anything else.

581
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But the energy in the room, man, was just different.

582
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
What was the what was the feeling you got looking at this thing?

583
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Just an unease, uneasy, uncomfortable, ominous.

584
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
That's the best way I can describe it.

585
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Did it feel powerful or conscious or did it feel like this inanimate object?

586
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Didn't feel inanimate and didn't feel conscious.

587
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
It just felt like this was significant.

588
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And it could have been the way that they brought us in.

589
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It could have been all the buildup.

590
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It could have been that.

591
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Do you have any extra context at this point?

592
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Did the instructors at any point?

593
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Are they in the room with you, by the way?

594
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
They are acting like this is a normal Tuesday.

595
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
That's what fucked me up even more.

596
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Like that was oddly very strange, man.

597
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Like this, I mean, I hadn't been exposed to anything like this before that or since.

598
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And they didn't say, so what you're about to experience is kind of trippy.

599
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
They just took you into this room.

600
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And maybe that was part of the point.

601
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It could have absolutely just been something that triggered an evaluation for me and this guy.

602
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And they brought us out there to see if we would react to the technology.

603
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
That could have been a part of it.

604
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Do you ask them at any point?

605
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So after a moment, I mean, have a moment to like kind of drink that in.

606
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And then they were talking about and they were kind of talking to us and each other.

607
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It felt just weird, man.

608
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Almost like they were purposely making it awkward, I would say.

609
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
But maybe it's just because I was in a weird situation.

610
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Do you know anything about these instructors as far as like do they have physics background or military background?

611
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Most of them have military background.

612
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
A lot of them come out of same type of special operations that we were in, at least some of them.

613
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But they are civilian contracted companies that are working for Crane.

614
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
GERB has come up with some really interesting research around how this is possibly SAIC

615
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
and how they've done some contracting work with Crane in the past.

616
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And SAIC is pretty deep in consciousness research.

617
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
In fact, the CIA has a psychic spy program.

618
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
This is fully, by the way, declassified and known and on record.

619
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Psychic spy program, it ran from 1972 to 1995.

620
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Probably some version of it is still going on today.

621
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I have trouble believing that they actually sunsetted it fully.

622
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Why wouldn't they? It was successful.

623
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Yeah, and you have people like Joseph McMonagle, his remote viewer number one,

624
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
who won the Legion of Merit for over 200 instances in which he added to military intelligence.

625
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
In fact, you have a quote from Jimmy Carter, president from 76 to 80,

626
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
saying, the craziest thing that I've ever experienced in my presidency was a remote viewer.

627
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Her name, I believe, was Rosemary Smith.

628
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Basically, there was this Tu-22 Russian spy plane that had gone down in Africa.

629
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
All of Africa is the target.

630
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And this woman draws a three-square-mile radius in Zaire where they find the plane.

631
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And he freaks out. And there's an audio of him saying this.

632
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And so for anybody out there, you should look into this.

633
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
This is a real program.

634
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
SAIC in Palo Alto was running a lot of the operations later for Stargate.

635
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And the psychic spy program. So they're extremely interested in this.

636
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And our friend, UAP Gerb, has dug up a lot of research around SAIC's work with Crane.

637
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And there are other instances, by the way, of tests going on with people and their psionic connection.

638
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And there's a guy named Chris Bledsoe you're probably familiar with, North Carolina.

639
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Crazy story.

640
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Crazy story. And a guy named Tim Taylor is a NASA mission controller.

641
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
We were talking about him last night. Shows up in Bledsoe's life.

642
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Shows him a piece of space material.

643
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And somehow Bledsoe knows that it's not from here.

644
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And there's this interesting kind of reaction.

645
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And then Tim Taylor says, why you? Or something.

646
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
He knows that at that point Bledsoe does actually have this genuine psychic ability or something.

647
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Well, dude, that's funny that you bring that up.

648
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Because I 100% when I saw that sphere could say that if I had no other context,

649
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
even though I had the off-world technologies label, if I had none of that, I would have been like, that's not from here.

650
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Right. More context or corroboration that maybe your story isn't happening in a vacuum.

651
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
There's a story of Yuri Geller where, again, say what you will about the guy.

652
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I think there might have been some snake oil and some of the stuff that he was doing.

653
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
He was brought over by a guy named Andre Pujaric, who was part of consciousness research going on in the US,

654
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
but also was doing weird MK Ultra stuff as well.

655
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
He brings over Yuri Geller.

656
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Yuri Geller has a crazy story with Werner von Braun, who's the father of the German and American space programs.

657
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Ran our Saturn program that took us to the moon.

658
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Where von Braun shows him, again, a piece of space material in a safe.

659
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And Yuri Geller is able to deduce that this is not from here or whatever.

660
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And so this seems to be kind of this recurring trope.

661
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah. Well, I mean, I definitely felt that when I saw it.

662
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I did not say that.

663
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And I think they were trying to see if we had a reaction to it.

664
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And I mean, because there was an awkward moment of silence, like I said, and then they started talking about it.

665
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And maybe they were discussing it to get further reaction out of us.

666
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
But they started talking about that it was recovered from a craft that had crashed.

667
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
They said that they did say that.

668
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Wow. So they said this orb was actually recovered from a craft.

669
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
But it itself was not the craft. Correct.

670
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Well, yeah. So what do we think?

671
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I mean, did you extrapolate anything from that as far as what role the orb played in the crafts overall working?

672
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So I want to be careful how what I what I say I remember and don't remember because this is a while ago.

673
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But I want to say I remember them talking about it being a control mechanism for the craft, some type of control mechanism for the craft.

674
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And I don't remember if they had said that to each other or to us.

675
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Like I said, there was kind of a two way conversation happening.

676
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,000
They were talking a little bit back and forth to each other and then talking, giving us bits of information also.

677
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So I don't remember exactly how that came out.

678
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
But I do remember them saying that it was potentially part of a control mechanism and that it interacted with consciousness.

679
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I wanted to ask a question I didn't. But I'm like, how would that how would they know that?

680
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Right. Wow. So, OK, you see this orb levitating on this podium.

681
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Then what happens? So we spent a little time there and then we went to the next object.

682
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And it was another metallic object. Very, very strange looking.

683
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Same type of vibe. It looked as hard to describe because it didn't get a full view of it.

684
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But it looked like something you could like reach in and grab and pick up.

685
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And maybe it was something that would you could put on your arm or so.

686
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Something that would use it would have to use it with their arm.

687
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
That's the best way I can describe it. Like a gauntlet, like a gauntlet.

688
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Yeah, this is a good analogy or maybe something that would like being like a shield.

689
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,000
But but and it had like a crystal type of display screen.

690
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I don't know if it was a display screen. It was square rectangular.

691
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Looked like it would potentially be display screen. And it was sitting.

692
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
It was not levitating. It was sitting on a like a table.

693
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And at that point, like I'm looking at it and it almost looked like a mirage type of effects.

694
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And in that above that display screen were these hieroglyphic symbols that I started to see appear.

695
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
What? Yeah. Hieroglyphic symbols.

696
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That's the best way I can describe them. And I don't know what they were.

697
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Anything going through your mind at this point as you're seeing?

698
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yeah, I was shitting bricks. Yeah, it was terrifying. I mean.

699
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
And are you trying to figure out? I'm just trying to be cool, man.

700
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I'm trying to not look like I'm trying to act normal. I don't know what's happening.

701
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I don't know what I'm what's what this is for.

702
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I'm just trying to just act like everything's fine. Yeah.

703
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And in retrospect, have you been able to deduce what any of these symbols were or draw them up or what they mean?

704
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So I've I've randomly like I like I told you, I meditate and all this stuff now.

705
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And during meditations, I've had a couple of times where they've come.

706
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I've thought about it and they've come into my my thoughts.

707
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Also, the lawyer, Danny Sheehan, he had talked about him and he had drawn some that looked a lot like what I saw.

708
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
A lot like what you saw.

709
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,000
So for context for the audience, Danny Sheehan in nineteen seventy four or five was taken into a skiff.

710
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Again, secret compartmentalized information facility in Washington, D.C.

711
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I believe at the behest of the incoming Carter administration.

712
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
So it might have even been seventy six.

713
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And he was shown basically the Blue Book files. Right.

714
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And he's looking through the Blue Book files and he sees this UFO crashed into the side of a mountain.

715
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And it's the dead of winter and there's some Air Force officers present.

716
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And he sees on the rim of the UFO these hieroglyphic symbols.

717
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:30,000
The UFO had had crashed into this field and there was snow and the dirt was all turned up and stuff.

718
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And the the UFO itself was stuck in the side of this big embankment.

719
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:41,000
In one of the photos, I could see these symbols that were all around the base of the of the dome.

720
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And I took out the yellow pad and I opened it up to the inside cardboard of it.

721
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And I slid it under the the microfiche machine and I focused it so that I could see the symbols.

722
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And then I traced the symbols exactly verbatim, you know, all the way around this half of the the dome that I could see.

723
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And I just put them all I just traced all of them.

724
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I saw that show and what he had drawn is very close to what I seen.

725
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And also I want to touch on something else that this correlates with documentary that I saw on YouTube about DMT.

726
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah.

727
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And these guys were doing they were doing experiments with DMT and they found that everybody was seeing the same symbols when they did shine a laser a certain way and and kind of did a diffracted the laser.

728
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Yep.

729
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
In a way that you do like the double slit experiment.

730
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yes.

731
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And in the diffraction, they saw these symbols and those symbols are the same.

732
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
That's fascinating.

733
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Yeah.

734
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Danny Jones does this amazing show on this.

735
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
And these guys are they're doing DMT.

736
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
They're showing they're showing a laser in a specific way exactly to create this diffraction effect.

737
00:51:48,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And then their kind of interpretation of this is like they're seeing almost like the source code like a binary code behind what we're seeing, which that sounds absolutely absurd.

738
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:08,000
But if you take physicists like John Wheeler seriously or people like Claude Shannon, who wasn't really more kind of information theory.

739
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,000
But like maybe the universe is more information theoretic at its at its core and we are rendering it in real time.

740
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And maybe when you take DMT, you ascend into these higher states and you can actually look at the source code itself.

741
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Yeah.

742
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And what does it mean then if that source code is in the same language of what you saw I saw on that device and whatever?

743
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Danny saw on that craft.

744
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:47,000
That makes me think that these things off world might be a slight misnomer and it might be an interior fabric to the reality that we're in every day or something, something even more fundamental to what we're seeing or something.

745
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Probably touching on something.

746
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:56,000
But when you're looking at these hieroglyphics, you obviously don't have the context of the Danny Sheehan interview or whatever.

747
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
At that point.

748
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
So are you what's going what's the first thing that goes through your head as to like what this is?

749
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Well, first thing is, am I hallucinating or am I seeing that I was squinting and looking at it?

750
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And I think even one of the guys was with us and asked me like because he saw me looking at it and asked me, are you everything all right?

751
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Or I don't remember exactly what he said, but he kind of inquired to why I was looking at it.

752
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And I was like, oh, yeah, and I just kind of brush it off and, you know, forgot about it.

753
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But I mean, not only did I see the symbols, but they were like changing like to different symbols.

754
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So there's there's a movement to them as well.

755
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So they weren't just like static.

756
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It's almost like like like they were shuffling in and out.

757
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
You ever see a predator?

758
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Oh, yeah.

759
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
You know how when he has a little communicator thing, he's like going to blow himself up and like it does a little.

760
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yeah, yeah. I kind of like that.

761
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Do you feel like it was like a holographic display or like the technology showing it?

762
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Did it feel prosaic or did it feel like just something you'd never seen before as far as the display itself?

763
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Holographic sure could have been, but it was very crisp.

764
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
You know, like where I would feel I feel like the holographic technology I've seen it like CES or whatever.

765
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It's it's almost like kind of hard to like you can see that it's a light.

766
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
You can tell that it's not. Yeah, that's not a solid object.

767
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Yeah, not a physical object.

768
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Yes, you could see in that case that it was like a light display.

769
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And in this case, does it almost feel like it's like part of reality itself?

770
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

771
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Wow.

772
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And oh, man, there's so many places to take this.

773
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Like we were talking last night and a lot of the early cryptographers, if you look at like I think he's a 14th century guy,

774
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Trithemius would write about cryptography in the context of angel communication.

775
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And even today, like we're in L.A. right now.

776
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
There are all sorts of people who say that they feel like they're communicated with by ETs or angels.

777
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Maybe those are, you know, the same thing via these like, you know, numerology.

778
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
One, one, one, two, two, two, three, three, three, you know, all sorts of people sort of say things like that.

779
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And you can kind of laugh it off.

780
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
But that is actually a longstanding tradition.

781
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Queen Elizabeth had a chief spy and magician. Right.

782
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
His name was John D.

783
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And he claimed to communicate with angels via what he would call Enochian language.

784
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
And I showed you some of these symbols.

785
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Alistair Crowley said, you know, similar thing.

786
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And he's probably a darker version of this, you know, not necessarily the most savory guy.

787
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
But he would communicate with these, you know, through Enochian language.

788
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And you said that these symbols looked somewhat like what you had seen.

789
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Yes.

790
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
That's fascinating.

791
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Yeah.

792
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I have a whole bunch of different perspectives that I think about because of seeing all this stuff after the fact.

793
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Yeah.

794
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And our minds are very fallible, you know.

795
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And so I don't know how much I don't want to over speak it and add something that's not true on accident.

796
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Well, I think the core details are remarkable unto themselves.

797
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I like trying to keep it to that because I don't want to screw with it.

798
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But it would appear like it's some kind of communication towards it's for sure.

799
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
It's trying to tell you something.

800
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Did you feel like anything got downloaded into you or you were not at that point the message of that point?

801
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:23,000
What definitely I could say after the fact is that it changed everything for me after that.

802
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And I don't know that it was because of the objects or because of what I was supposed or if it was just because it made me think differently.

803
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And let me down a different path.

804
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
So what happens at that point?

805
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Do you turn to these instructors and you say, hey, guys, what the hell was that?

806
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
You just get let out of the room.

807
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
What?

808
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah.

809
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So we discussed a little bit more stuff.

810
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I remember they spoke about the object a little.

811
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,000
It got brought up that somebody was potentially harmed in the retrieval of that item.

812
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
OK.

813
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:59,000
The gauntlet or the second item that it had discharged some kind of energy that somebody had been harmed or even possibly killed.

814
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
And they were they were discussing that.

815
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And then we went back through the screen checkpoints.

816
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
We got upstairs.

817
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
We were told not to discuss it with anybody else in the class.

818
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
They were pretty serious when they told us that.

819
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And I'm pretty sure in our initial whenever you go to like a military course initially like the first day or two is like admin stuff.

820
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,000
And so you're filling out all your paperwork and getting everything ready to start the class and the training.

821
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And so I'm sure we saw you don't read all that stuff, especially when you go to class after class.

822
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So I'm sure we signed NDAs and stuff in that beginning part.

823
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
We didn't sign anything additional after that.

824
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
So there was nothing nothing remarkable about that.

825
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,000
We were just told not to discuss it with the class and that or not to discuss it outside of that.

826
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So that was it.

827
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Go back to your normal life.

828
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Go back to your normal life.

829
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I never was exposed to anything else again and never got brought up again.

830
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I never spoke to the other Green Beret again.

831
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
He was from a different team, different group, and we never spoke about it again.

832
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I now personally know from some contacts in Navy Special Warfare that Naval Surface Warfare crane does deal in the most exotic adversary weaponry.

833
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It also deals with the DOE, the Department of Energy, and our nuclear capabilities.

834
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And it frequently coordinates with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which is just a three hour drive away.

835
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:27,000
In fact, my contacts told me that if Wright-Patterson is the center of the Air Force's most exotic off-world reverse engineering efforts,

836
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Naval Surface Warfare crane is the center of the Navy's off-world reverse engineering efforts.

837
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
All of this just further corroborates Randy's story.

838
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And where have we heard of off-planet technology before?

839
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Well, Harold Malmgren, a top advisor to JFK, Nixon, LBJ, and Ford, claimed that he was personally briefed on other world technologies by Richard Bissell of the CIA.

840
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:01,000
This story is a huge deal given Malmgren's unimpeachable credentials, and Richard Bissell founded and set up Area 51 on behalf of the CIA.

841
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Could Malmgren and Bissell's other world technology now be called off-world technology?

842
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
The same off-world technology that Randy saw?

843
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Why come out now and why talk to me about it?

844
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
A good friend of mine, Mike Herrera, came out.

845
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I saw David Grush was brave enough to come out and that guy had some really high level information and took a lot of risk doing that.

846
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And who am I to protect my little story?

847
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I think it's important as part of the story.

848
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I think it's important to tell it because it adds to the credibility of all these guys that are doing it.

849
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So I just think it's the right thing to do.

850
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Hopefully there's other people that can explain what that was.

851
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I mean, that would be some nice closure for me to be able to find out if that was actually off-world tech.

852
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
How has your life changed since that experience?

853
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Because even though you weren't able to speak about it again, you never experienced anything like it,

854
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
where you were maybe shown secret tech in a classified facility.

855
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I can imagine that just being extremely ontologically shocking to the point where your aperture,

856
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
your measurement tool that is what you see and are interested in, opens up.

857
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Well, I mean, yeah, immediately that changed for me.

858
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I got back that night later than everybody else, obviously, to the barracks and I couldn't sleep.

859
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
And I stayed up all night thinking about, does this mean aliens?

860
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
What does this mean?

861
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:36,000
It was absolutely shocking to my state of awareness and my belief systems.

862
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It took a bit for me to wrap my mind around that.

863
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
What helped was it kind of sent me down the rabbit hole of all this stuff.

864
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I started digging into the other stories.

865
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I started taking them maybe more seriously and not just brushing them off as bullshit.

866
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And so it did open my aperture.

867
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
It did allow me to start looking at other things.

868
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Then we talked about the Stephen Griff stuff and he talked about consciousness and meditation

869
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
being a component of communications.

870
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I started meditating.

871
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And all those things have helped benefit me in my life in significant ways.

872
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
So it's almost been healing in some sense.

873
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Initially it wasn't.

874
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
And because of that, I think it ultimately turned out to be.

875
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I think that's a common story of you experience something kind of paranormal.

876
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
It shocks you.

877
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It busts you out of your comfort zone.

878
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And then you realize your comfort zone was actually kind of limited

879
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
and not always the most positive orientation towards the world.

880
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And this opens you up to all these other possibilities and can be dark and scary and lonely.

881
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
But it also leads you down kind of a more spiritual path.

882
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I think a big component of that was I was so in my ego at those times.

883
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Obviously I did jobs like being a fireman and being a green brain,

884
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
not because I wanted recognition for that stuff.

885
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I did it because I wanted to help people and do something good for people.

886
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
That's what drove me to those careers.

887
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
But also there was a part of me that enjoyed being recognized as that person.

888
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
People look at firemen like your local heroes.

889
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Green braids are badasses.

890
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I thought that was cool.

891
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
After that happened, and like I told you last night,

892
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I kind of had sort of an ego death, I would call it.

893
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I can't give a shit about any of that anymore.

894
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
But it allowed me to appreciate the things I've done more

895
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
because it wasn't anymore about what people thought about it.

896
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
It was just because it was the right thing to do.

897
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And I felt even better about it.

898
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Sounds pretty positive.

899
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And meeting Michael Herrera, how did that come about?

900
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
For context for the audience, Michael Herrera has gone on a couple of podcasts,

901
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
probably most notably Sean Ryan.

902
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
This is a guy who was definitely deployed in Indonesia.

903
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
He was with his unit and he sees a craft.

904
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
What I remember is kind of like a pyramid shape at the top like this

905
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
because I remember seeing some shading.

906
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And then it had corners, right?

907
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
And I remember seeing these vents,

908
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
at least that's what it looks like on each of the corners like this.

909
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
So there's a vent here.

910
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And it was like it was positioned on the lines like this.

911
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And then on each corner, when this thing took off,

912
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
it had lights that would pop on,

913
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
which would have been like red, yellow, green, and blue

914
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
are the only ones I remember that kind of had a line that went like this.

915
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And it had some sort of scale pattern that I estimate is octagonal,

916
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,000
but it could honestly be circular, it could be square.

917
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I wasn't close enough to depict it.

918
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
This was the blackest, darkest thing that I have ever seen in my life.

919
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
All of a sudden, what he thinks maybe is this DOE,

920
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Department of Energy paramilitary unit,

921
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
with far superior weaponry and kind of apparel,

922
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
shows up, basically swears his unit to secrecy,

923
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
and takes control of the situation.

924
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
He was later backchanneled with

925
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
from somebody claiming to be part of the quote-unquote legacy UFO program.

926
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And this person says,

927
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
hey, you saw some really gnarly stuff out there.

928
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
What we were doing is actually, and this is where it gets dark and weird,

929
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
rounding up people from disaster zones, like Indonesia at the time,

930
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
and testing their psionic ability,

931
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
so their ability to interact with these exotic crafts,

932
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
so that we could maybe basically do flight testing with these people.

933
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
And again, it's just another data point for your story,

934
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
because you're talking about this kind of mind-matter interaction connection,

935
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
and they're doing that stuff in Indonesia.

936
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And this is a guy, by the way, Michael Herrera.

937
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Correct me if I'm wrong, because you know him well.

938
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I think he runs a very successful business in Colorado.

939
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
It's literally zero reason.

940
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
If anything, he's lost business over coming out.

941
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
It doesn't benefit him to do this.

942
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
He did it because the same reason I'm doing it,

943
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
it was the right thing to do.

944
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
His story is crazy, man.

945
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Definitely, people should look into that.

946
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Fascinating.

947
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Who knows how much dark stuff is really going on tied to all this,

948
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:35,000
and if that's why they fight to keep this part of this so compartmentalized and secret?

949
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I don't know, man.

950
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
And how did you meet him?

951
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Was it through your newfound interest and kind of out there stuff from your experience?

952
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Well, yeah, and then some of the stuff he talked about.

953
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
He brought up some of the stuff that the unit had.

954
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I added some stuff that I thought maybe we chatted on social media,

955
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
and then kind of just became friends through that.

956
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Okay.

957
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Yeah, it's interesting.

958
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Once you kind of come out of the woodwork, stick your head out of the water,

959
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
you see maybe there's some other people who have experienced some pretty crazy stuff.

960
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I've found through my own research in this area,

961
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I think the common misconception is civilians, they're conspiratorial.

962
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
People in the government, they're like these normies or something.

963
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
It's the opposite.

964
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Absolutely.

965
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
The government are more conspiratorial than people outside of the government,

966
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
and I think it's because there are people like you.

967
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
You're the extreme version of this,

968
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
but there are so many people like you who have experienced weird stuff

969
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
while working in the government,

970
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
and then it's like this kind of don't look over there,

971
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
but you kind of file it away forever,

972
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
and you kind of saw the little thing in the room you weren't supposed to look at or whatever,

973
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
and there's a lot of that.

974
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Yeah, let me say peering behind the curtain, once you do that, you can't go back.

975
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Can't go back.

976
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I think we're both aware, and it's kind of an open secret at this point.

977
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I mean, you have Ross Coulthart saying publicly on News Nation,

978
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:03,000
there's a story, it's going to break in January, things are going to get kind of crazy.

979
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:10,000
It seems like an open secret in UFO disclosure world that a lot is going to come out in this area.

980
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It is.

981
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And I think both of us feel that that could be extremely positive and extremely negative,

982
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and it's a Pandora's box.

983
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,000
And I've always formerly been on the side of release as much as we can

984
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
because I think the public deserves to know the truth.

985
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But then it's funny, as you get to this kind of exciting, you know,

986
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
things are bursting at the seams tipping point,

987
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:42,000
it also gets a little scary, and you realize that there is something adaptive about materialist reductionism,

988
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
and thinking that this world we live in is extremely limited,

989
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
and just like random atoms bouncing off of one another.

990
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Like there's something actually very adaptive about that from like leading your life in a normal way on a day to day basis.

991
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
And so how do we lead this in a positive way?

992
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Obviously, based on what I'm doing, my belief is that the truth is what we all need to fight for, right?

993
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Yeah.

994
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Getting the truth out, and I think it's important.

995
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:17,000
But also maybe there is a maybe there is a component of this that's there's a reason why some of this was kept back.

996
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Maybe there is a and I could say that there certainly is part of it that if was told to everyone would would change reality,

997
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
but ultimately it needs to happen.

998
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I just think there we have to be ready for it as well.

999
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Yeah.

1000
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I don't know what that looks like, but I think what you're doing is is a huge part of that.

1001
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I mean, getting awareness out there about it, talking about it.

1002
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Our reality might not be what we think, and we might have we might have stumbled across this historically in the past,

1003
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
and it might have been bad then, you know?

1004
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Well, the point you're getting at, I think, is the fact that we're not alone in the universe is not the tip of the spear.

1005
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
That's not the thing that it's funny.

1006
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I hear reporters like Ross Coulthard, Jeremy Corbell, people who are honestly closer than people like me,

1007
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:16,000
maybe a little more risk averse as far as speaking to people in and around the quote unquote legacy UFO program.

1008
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And it seems like they always get to a point in the conversation at the end of the conversation

1009
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,000
where the person on the inside says you would not be pro disclosure if you knew everything I knew.

1010
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And I worry that there's actual merit to that.

1011
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I do, because I think we're dealing with sacred spiritual things, ontological truths.

1012
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:46,000
And at least in the military context, you're talking about that in a using that and instrumental, you know,

1013
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:58,000
weaponistic ways that are kind of not sacred, you know, like for our kind of brutal needs and desires and geopolitical realities.

1014
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And that's weird territory.

1015
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Yeah, man, I think I think there's a lot of merit to that.

1016
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
There's things I wouldn't want my my son, for example, to know.

1017
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I wouldn't want him to know that that's a true part of reality.

1018
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
So what does that mean for everyone? I don't know.

1019
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:19,000
That's a tricky slippery. It's extremely tricky because like you drive around L.A., you drive around any major city,

1020
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Las Vegas, any major city in the US, and you look around and from a kind of architecture infrastructure perspective,

1021
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
most of these places have not been they're crumbling and they haven't been updated since the 60s and 70s.

1022
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
And now we have it's interesting.

1023
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,000
The National Science Foundation officially coming out saying we're looking into extended electrodynamics.

1024
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:47,000
And that is basically this new paradigm in science that involves a scalar field,

1025
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,000
exotic electromagnetic wave types that get into like the works of Tesla,

1026
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,000
this kind of unknown guy named Thomas Townsend Brown, who's now probably being vindicated.

1027
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And you're talking about the ability to manipulate gravity through electromagnetism and do all sorts of stuff through high speed rail.

1028
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Let's bring the Concorde back with with with with flight that, you know, get to Europe in an hour or whatever.

1029
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And so that's really important, right? That's important.

1030
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
And ontological truth is important. And then there are, you know, risk factors as well.

1031
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And so it's this weird technological forcing function where it can be really good and it can be really bad.

1032
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Yeah. And I mean, I sure as hell don't know the answer.

1033
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I just I hope that we're contributing in a positive way.

1034
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I think we have to listen to the people closest to the action on these things.

1035
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:44,000
And so it's like the the experiencers, you're an experiencer, at least of the technology.

1036
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And most of those people say they come out saying we're getting a warning that, you know,

1037
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
these things care about our nuclear facilities because that is the center of the apocalypse.

1038
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:01,000
If you were to place the end of the world anywhere would be at these these Q clearance facilities where we could blow up the world.

1039
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And so the fact that they're showing up there is probably a warning.

1040
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
It's not that I don't think they're prepping the battle space.

1041
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I think they are like doing recon on our abilities.

1042
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I think they're saying don't blow yourselves up.

1043
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
But I could be right. That's again our interpretation.

1044
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:24,000
But well, yeah. And so I can look at that both ways because I can look at it from from just my human open heart way of looking at it and say, yeah, I agree.

1045
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:32,000
And then the tactical mindset I have tells me but we don't prepare for the best case scenario, prepare for the worst case scenario.

1046
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Yes. And so what is that?

1047
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And that is they are prepping the battlefield.

1048
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
So we have we have to observe and be aware and be ready.

1049
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Sure. So interesting.

1050
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I mean, we talked about Diana Pasolka, this religious studies professor.

1051
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
She's amazing.

1052
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And she wrote a book about modern UFO phenomena as a religious phenomena.

1053
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
And she meant to write about it as a psyop a psychological opera.

1054
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
She was like, I think this is probably all fake.

1055
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Then she falls into it and she's like, oh, my God, this is very real.

1056
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Yeah. And it's this interesting thing where you stare at the abyss long enough to stare back or whatever you fall into it.

1057
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:14,000
And she's like, oh, my God, this this becomes real and almost realizes that what we are looking at now is what a lot of divine contact experiences have been in the past.

1058
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:25,000
And she talks about St. Francis of Assisi, who sees this flaming torch, you know, orb thing on Mount Laverne and I think 12th or 13th century Italy.

1059
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:30,000
And it's to him, it's this forcing function towards God.

1060
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And he actually has electromagnetic what seems like electromagnetic radiation as a result of this experience, what we would now call that.

1061
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Yeah. And and then actually writes in his diary.

1062
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
The last thing he writes is the Greek letter tau, which means conversion.

1063
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
And so it's like this force. It's like he had this angelic experience and it's this forced conversion to Christianity.

1064
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,000
And it's called the stigmata because there was a stigma around his experience.

1065
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:03,000
And the talk about modern UFO abduction cases, there's this big stigma and there's this like, you know, desire to not disclose in this.

1066
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
You know, it's so fascinating. Yeah.

1067
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I especially like a lot of the stuff she talks about when she talks about these all these people that have been key contributors to like rocketry and in the way that they got their ideas.

1068
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
And that's wild, man. Yeah.

1069
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
What are we missing? What do I need to be doing?

1070
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I'm not doing, you know, like that's that's kind of shit I started digging into.

1071
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And, you know, I mean, there's something to it.

1072
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Well, the intersect whenever somebody is doing something kind of trippy or unconventional, but they're also a key contributor in a conventional sense to a core program or capability.

1073
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
You have to look into that.

1074
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:58,000
And so in this case, the fathers of all of the space programs, American space program is a guy named Jack Parsons founded Jet Propulsion Labs, the Russian space program, a guy named Tchaikovsky, and then the German space program, Werner von Braun.

1075
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:09,000
All of these guys thought that they were in touch with non-human entities and they were doing Tesla is a great example to Tesla said that he communicated with extraterrestrials in Colorado.

1076
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
So, yeah, you have to start maybe taking some of these things seriously.

1077
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:21,000
And a lot of these guys say that that is actually essential to our, you know, their ability to actually work in these rocketry programs.

1078
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
And so this guy named Tim Taylor, who is a modern NASA mission controller, works with Elon Musk.

1079
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I've met this guy and I actually am invested in a rocket company and I was, you know, it was it was struggling.

1080
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
And I was like, man, how do we get this thing to work?

1081
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Because he's this famous NASA mission controller.

1082
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Give me advice or whatever.

1083
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And I was grasping at straws.

1084
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:47,000
And he goes, you have to think about what they want as far as how to get the rocket to work.

1085
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I was like, they you mean like non-human intelligent?

1086
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Yeah, that's wild, wild.

1087
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Yeah.

1088
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
And I'm listening to this guy.

1089
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I'm like, is he siopping?

1090
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I don't know.

1091
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
He's a he's a real NASA mission controller.

1092
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Yeah.

1093
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Works at the highest level.

1094
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Look at all the names of the programs.

1095
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Right.

1096
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Artemis.

1097
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Yeah.

1098
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
And you start looking into that.

1099
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
The iconography, the second century Latin writing.

1100
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Exactly, man.

1101
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Like it starts to.

1102
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I mean, just just keep your eyes open.

1103
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Yeah.

1104
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,000
It feels like 2025 is sort of a consciousness apotheosis of sorts.

1105
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:28,000
You have all of these converging, accelerating dynamics and you have artificial intelligence.

1106
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:35,000
You have open AI, anthropic, you know, all sorts of spin outs and offshoots of these

1107
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:41,000
organizations that are buying up tons and tons of Nvidia chips and in this massive race.

1108
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
And then the U.S. vis a vis China, mainly China, but also Russia and, you know, other

1109
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
other adversaries.

1110
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
You have this global AI race.

1111
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:56,000
You have, you know, the Google quantum sycamore processor that they just announced that they

1112
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
say might theoretically prove the many worlds hypothesis.

1113
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
It's crazy.

1114
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
It's crazy.

1115
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
You have those two things.

1116
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And then you also have the David Grush revelations that we're talking about today and that your

1117
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,000
testimony, you know, really provides more evidence more, which is that we're not alone

1118
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
and that reality is way weirder than we think.

1119
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
And all three of these things seem to be converging.

1120
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And I interviewed a guy named Matthew Pines.

1121
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
He's pretty connected in the kind of national security world.

1122
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
And he said that, you know, somebody in a very clear to a lot of things, I think, at

1123
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
the Pentagon said something like AI quantum plus the grush stuff.

1124
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Yeah.

1125
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,000
And that that iron triangle of dynamics will unleash a whole host of crazy possibilities.

1126
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Yeah.

1127
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
And as, you know, people in the national security state, you know, this guy or whatever, he's

1128
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
like, that's what we're tracking.

1129
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
So, yeah, how do we make sense of this?

1130
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Dude, I mean, I 100 percent think a lot of these things are connected in some way that

1131
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
we might not quite understand yet.

1132
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I don't know.

1133
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I mean, we could theorize about it all day, but I know there are people that are trying

1134
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
to stay ahead of the game on that.

1135
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
And an example that is my good friend, Chris Wright.

1136
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:11,000
He's CEO of a company called AITC, the Artificial Intelligence Trust Council.

1137
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
And I'm part of that as well.

1138
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And the mission for us is to try to slow down the growth of AI, at least to a point where

1139
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:28,000
the people have a say in how far this goes, because right now it's a runaway train and

1140
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
no one really knows what's happening behind the curtain.

1141
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And there's really no oversight on potentially the most deadly could be weapon system ever

1142
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
developed.

1143
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Yep.

1144
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:46,000
What I say that is any significant amount of technology that's capable of doing great

1145
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
things is sometimes also capable of great destruction.

1146
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I'm telling you about drones that you could drop the sizes smaller than the palm of your

1147
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
hand.

1148
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
You could drop hundreds of thousands of them out of the back of a C-130 and could be trained

1149
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:06,000
to individually seek out and kill individual targets without a human component to take

1150
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
away the human component from the decision to take a life.

1151
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I think that's where we're crossing the line we shouldn't cross.

1152
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,000
It's extremely dystopian from a warfare perspective as early as, and probably earlier than this,

1153
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:25,000
but like Donald Rumsfeld, I remember in the Bush 43 admin, Secretary of Defense, his

1154
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:30,000
whole thing was we need to roboticize or autonomize American military.

1155
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And it was probably like too early in the technology curve at the time and sort of got

1156
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
semi-rejected.

1157
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Now it feels like all this stuff is just happening.

1158
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And once you start to get these envoys that are like doing things on your behalf, you

1159
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:52,000
get weird decisions made and the stories around, you know, fingers, you know, aborts of like

1160
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
nuclear possibility.

1161
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
That's always because a human is in the loop.

1162
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Exactly.

1163
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
The Russia thing.

1164
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
The Russia thing is a great example.

1165
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
It was in the 80s or something.

1166
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Where that guy could have, this close, that guy could have caused, you know, global cataclysm.

1167
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And because of his own moral conscience and no superior, he, you know, didn't basically

1168
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
activate the need.

1169
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Yeah.

1170
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
What would an AI system have done?

1171
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
It would have made the decision immediately to just neutralize the threat.

1172
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
It would have been a cold hard calculation.

1173
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Zero intuition.

1174
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Yep.

1175
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I think there's something about, you know, the whole AI conversation, which is that the

1176
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:41,000
brain is a Turing machine and it's this, you know, calculator on steroids.

1177
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And so if the brain is just this calculator, we're going to recreate consciousness via

1178
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
AI.

1179
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
And I think it's this total misnomer and misunderstanding of the brain.

1180
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I in fact think we learn with low data sets.

1181
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Babies come out of the womb with some understanding of grammar, a fear of snakes, you know, all

1182
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
sorts of things.

1183
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Which is encoded in something deeper, right?

1184
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Way deeper.

1185
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
And we're not learning through these large data sets.

1186
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
There's something very different about remote viewing, right?

1187
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
How do you explain that?

1188
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
You ever hear about the hundredth monkey?

1189
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
No, I want to hear that.

1190
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Something you didn't know about.

1191
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Yeah, there's a lot I don't know about.

1192
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:21,000
No, so I'm a pair of raising man, so probably get hammered on this, but island of monkeys,

1193
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
certain type of monkey.

1194
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I think it's in Japan that they have a species of monkeys that's separated by an island and

1195
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
the same species, but they're separated and they never interact with each other.

1196
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
They were dropping, they were doing experiments.

1197
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,000
They were dropping these potatoes on the island and they were getting covered in dirt and

1198
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
sand when they dropped them on the beach.

1199
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And one of the monkeys figured out if I just take it to the water and wash it off, then

1200
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I can eat it without the sand, right?

1201
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Simple thing.

1202
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Well, it taught the other monkeys how to do it.

1203
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
And quickly the whole island knew how to do that.

1204
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
They called it the hundredth monkey.

1205
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:01,000
As soon as a certain number of monkeys realized this is what they do, suddenly and instantaneously

1206
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
the other islands started doing it.

1207
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And so they don't know exactly what that mechanism is, but they think there's some kind of component

1208
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
of consciousness that's tied to that that's allowing that to jump.

1209
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I think so.

1210
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And there's other studies to that too.

1211
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Like you saw the Stanford did the one with the light and the plants.

1212
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And so there's a lot of that that's starting to like come out in science.

1213
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
It's showing us that consciousness might be there's a component to that.

1214
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
That's that's you know, we don't understand at all.

1215
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Well, we might have deeper.

1216
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Yeah.

1217
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Speaking of like uploading consciousness to the cloud and how weird that sounds from an

1218
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
AI perspective, that might be going on with our conscious.

1219
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Like we might have a client server side interaction with our consciousness, but that's way more

1220
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
magical and robust.

1221
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And so a good example is the banister effect where upload times are slower than download

1222
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
times.

1223
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,000
So breaking the four minute mile as the first person is going to be much harder than downloading

1224
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
that, you know, going down.

1225
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
It already exists.

1226
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Yeah.

1227
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
And there's a guy named Rupert Sheldrake who studies all this stuff.

1228
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And he says that once you grow, if you grow a first crystal structure of its kind, it

1229
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:14,000
takes a long amount of time because he thinks that that's proof that it's it's drawing from

1230
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
the local information field that hasn't been done before.

1231
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
So it takes a while for that new crystal structure.

1232
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
You grow that same crystal structure.

1233
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
After that, it comes much faster.

1234
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Yes.

1235
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:29,000
If you make a new chemical compound for the first time and you crystallize it, that crystal

1236
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
form won't have existed before because it's a new compound.

1237
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
And the more often you crystallize it, the easier it should get for crystals of that

1238
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
kind to form.

1239
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
And in fact, that's amazing.

1240
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Well, it is actually really well known to chemists that new compounds are very difficult

1241
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
to crystallize.

1242
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
You maybe wait years before you get the first crystal.

1243
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
But thereafter, it gets easier to crystallize all around the world.

1244
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
That's insane.

1245
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
That's crazy.

1246
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I think about sometimes athletic accomplishments, too, where somebody pushes the bar just a

1247
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:04,000
little bit farther and then all of a sudden it just seems easier or something ostensibly.

1248
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And like you could attribute that to like modern doping or something.

1249
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
But I think it's something more than that.

1250
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:15,000
It's almost as if an accomplishment that formerly was thought to be impossible is uploaded

1251
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
to a central monad or repository or something.

1252
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:25,000
And then if somebody calls upon it with the right resonance in the future, you know, it's

1253
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:30,000
that much easier because you have more data in the repository or something like that.

1254
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:37,000
He also shows that if 1,000 people, there are 10,000 people do a crossword puzzle and

1255
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:43,000
a new person does that crossword puzzle the next day, they'll finish it a little bit faster

1256
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,000
than a random crossword puzzle that nobody has done prior.

1257
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
So that ties into the same thing with the 100th Monkey Man.

1258
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Same thing, 100th Monkey.

1259
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:56,000
And just innovation popping up at different places around the world at the same time.

1260
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
The invention of the wheel or the invention of all sorts.

1261
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Diane talks about that, too, right?

1262
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Where rocketry kind of happening like simultaneous in different places.

1263
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Why is it happening in Russia and the US and then later Germany all at the same time?

1264
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Yeah, there's some sort of maybe predetermined arc of technology.

1265
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:20,000
And then you look at how science occurs and it's way more revelatory if you actually look

1266
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
at the descriptions from the scientists.

1267
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,000
They're not like I calculated XYZ and then the answer came to me.

1268
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,000
The architecture of the hydrogen atom came to Wolfgang Pally in a dream.

1269
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Right.

1270
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
The rock equation came to him while he was staring at the fire.

1271
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:40,000
This idea that the mind is fully separate from an objective material world.

1272
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I think that'll probably go away pretty soon.

1273
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Yeah.

1274
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:49,000
There's a concept out there where I forget who said it, but they talk about us being like a receiver.

1275
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Yes.

1276
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
And that the consciousness field is the signal and we're just tapping into that field, right?

1277
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I think that's a cool analogy that actually makes a lot of sense when you start to answer

1278
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
some of these questions of how this is happening, right?

1279
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Totally.

1280
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I like that analogy.

1281
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
That kind of sits well with me.

1282
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Yeah, I love that.

1283
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Yeah.

1284
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Transmission theory of the consciousness.

1285
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
We're just tapping in, man.

1286
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Totally.

1287
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Yeah.

1288
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
And maybe our job is to like work on us as receivers, like work on the energy field.

1289
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
We're thinking about it like that too.

1290
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:25,000
We're almost like a technology ourself and if you eat healthy and you work out, the signal's better.

1291
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Yeah.

1292
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Right?

1293
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Yeah.

1294
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Well, what's happening when you daydream?

1295
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Are you constructing those thoughts actively?

1296
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
No, it seems like you're receiving things from elsewhere.

1297
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:42,000
If you're in a dream-like state, you are not consciously creating the semantic thoughts,

1298
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,000
but they're pouring in and there's this question in neuroscience of the binding problem.

1299
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,000
They know how all the disparate parts of your brain work, Broca's areas, speech, Wernicke's

1300
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000
areas, reading comprehension, but we don't know how it blends together into the seamless

1301
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
perception.

1302
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
And then it can remove a part that's supposed to do this thing and then it will find a way

1303
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
around and to rewrite and do it anyway.

1304
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Exactly.

1305
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
It's somehow malleable and understands how to...

1306
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Yeah.

1307
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
And it's like a radio.

1308
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Like if you were to remove the capacitor or the battery of the radio, maybe the music

1309
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,000
would stop playing or not play in the right way, but you really need to know that it's

1310
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
tapping into an electromagnetic field via this antenna.

1311
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
The field's still there.

1312
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
The field's still there.

1313
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:28,000
And that's the thing tapping into of all these four seasons or whatever's playing.

1314
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
It's that.

1315
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
It's the field.

1316
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
It's not locally being produced inside of you.

1317
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
What do you think, just your opinion on that?

1318
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
The plank field, is that where that sits?

1319
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Is that it?

1320
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Is that physically?

1321
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Gets into stuff that's way smarter than me and deeper than me, but I think there's a

1322
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:50,000
sub-quantum field that deals with quantum potentials, so vector and scalar potentials

1323
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:55,000
that deal with actually what we were talking about before as far as anomalies in electromagnetism

1324
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
where this guy named Lorenz, who had this equation where he set the derivatives of the

1325
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
vector and scalar potentials to zero.

1326
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:07,000
But in fact, I think Oliver Heaviside, who was one of the fathers of electromagnetism,

1327
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
knew this.

1328
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:14,000
And basically, I think there's another field involving scalar and vector potentials.

1329
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
And that explains these anomalies in electromagnetism, like the Aronoff-Bohm effect, where you

1330
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,000
don't have electric fields or magnetic fields present, but you do have these potentials

1331
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
present.

1332
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:30,000
And so maybe a lot arises around these potentials.

1333
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And maybe the potentials themselves are sort of the quantum code, if you will, of the universe,

1334
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
which is kind of information theoretic, a la John Wheeler.

1335
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And again, I'm speaking about things that are well beyond my pay grade.

1336
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I mean, but it ties into the same thing.

1337
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And I also like, have you heard of the E8 theory, where it's like the eight dimensional

1338
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
quasicrystal is projecting reality onto?

1339
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Oh, I mean, look into that.

1340
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
That gets a little beyond my understanding of it, because I mean, I just this is like

1341
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
hobby level, like looking into it for me.

1342
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Me too.

1343
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I don't have the background, but they talk about this, that our reality is a projection

1344
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
from an eight dimensional plane.

1345
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And that all of and they can they can correlate that with all the different particles that

1346
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
tie into and the way they describe is really cool.

1347
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Like they show a three dimensional, a two dimensional depiction of a three dimensional

1348
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
crystal on a like as a shadow.

1349
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And they show you how that can how it moves and rotates when they rotate the three dimensional

1350
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
piece.

1351
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
And they say if you can imagine that eight levels up and like that, that's how that's

1352
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
projecting down into 3D.

1353
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
That's that's pretty cool, man.

1354
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Well, it's almost like, you know, this like you have these platonic solids, these, you

1355
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,000
know, platonic objects that like like a tesseract.

1356
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Right.

1357
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
You cannot visualize a tesseract.

1358
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
No, you can only see the shadow of a tesseract.

1359
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Right.

1360
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And that's a 3D.

1361
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
And that's a 3D rendering of this thing.

1362
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,000
And then you have to ask, is the world itself a 3D rendering of this higher thing going

1363
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
on, which goes back to like Plato's cave?

1364
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And are we just rendering it in this like kind of low level substrate?

1365
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
That's all we can kind of comprehend.

1366
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
And then there's that's the quantum.

1367
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
What is it?

1368
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,000
The double slit experiment that explain, you know, how we collapse, collapse the wave function

1369
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
with consciousness.

1370
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Right.

1371
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I think an extremely valid hypothesis that's actually consistent with the Copenhagen school's

1372
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
interpretation that measurement collapses the wave function is that there's something

1373
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
actually about our minds that are that collapse the wave function.

1374
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
And every serious quantum field theorist entertain this at the time.

1375
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,000
And now you have modern quantum theorists saying, no, it's, it's just the particles

1376
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
kind of, you know, once they interact, they are, you know, once the waves interact, they

1377
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
collapse into particles or whatever.

1378
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
And it's like, what about like what Schrodinger himself thought?

1379
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Or what about what, you know, von Neumann thought?

1380
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Well, it's like, you know, Sean Carroll talks about this.

1381
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,000
He's got like a very strict view on this where it's like, this is just how the math plays

1382
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
out or whatever.

1383
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,000
And then you go like the other extreme where it's where it's like, you know, this is saying

1384
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
that consciousness is collapsing the wave function.

1385
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:08,000
And so do you, is it actually when they say this, I don't know exactly the right answer

1386
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
to this.

1387
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Are they saying that the actual act of measurement or just the act of observing?

1388
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Which one?

1389
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:19,000
So Copenhagen school keeps it very humble in their claims and they just say the act of

1390
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
measurement collapses the wave function.

1391
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,000
And I'm glad you brought up Sean Carroll because he's the most popular kind of quantum

1392
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
guy now.

1393
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:33,000
And what he'll say is reality itself, quantum reality itself is probabilistic.

1394
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
But that is totally antagonistic.

1395
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
And that is again, and I'm a fan of Sean Carroll.

1396
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
He's like explained all sorts of things that like a stupid person like me can understand.

1397
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
So I'm grateful to him.

1398
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
But he'll say things like reality is fundamentally probabilistic.

1399
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Like somehow Schrodinger's wave equation, which is probabilistic, is the substrate of

1400
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
reality.

1401
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Schrodinger himself would talk about Schrodinger's cat of existing in superposition as a joke

1402
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,000
because he didn't even clips of Roger Penrose.

1403
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
He wasn't serious.

1404
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
He wasn't serious.

1405
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
He didn't actually think that the cat could exist in superposition.

1406
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
He was almost using it as a way of like showing the ridiculousness.

1407
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Showing how ridiculous and weird as far as ontological truth, the quantum stuff points

1408
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
to, but saying we actually probably need to figure this out.

1409
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,000
People often say, well, maybe with a sufficient technicality, we could build a Schrodinger's

1410
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
cat.

1411
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
That was not what Schrodinger's point was.

1412
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
He was saying this is ridiculous.

1413
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
You can't really have a cat which is dead and alive at the same time.

1414
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Yeah.

1415
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
But it was a mere illustration of a wider point, right?

1416
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
That's right.

1417
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,000
I love how science and this esoteric thinking and science is all kind of coming together

1418
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
in this unique way.

1419
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:48,000
It's like you could look at it any way from any perspective and you could find some truth.

1420
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
It's awesome, man.

1421
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Okay.

1422
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,000
So there's a lot of good, a lot of consciousness raising we're going to get out of this.

1423
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
There might be some bad.

1424
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
This is a Pandora's box.

1425
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Things are going to get crazy.

1426
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:07,000
How do we prepare for a world where this sort of stuff that's been kind of held in the back

1427
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
closet just gets busted wide open?

1428
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,000
As far as just being prepared, dude, if that worst case scenario is what happens, I think

1429
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
people need to start awareness is key, right?

1430
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Starting to be aware of what's going on.

1431
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Start digging in.

1432
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Start identifying for you what's true.

1433
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Use your discernment.

1434
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Look into companies like RAITC that's trying to be a buffer for some of this and prevent

1435
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
the proliferation of AI and all these things.

1436
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Join movements like ours.

1437
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Go to your local people in your local area.

1438
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
In Vegas, I have my company Bravo One Defense.

1439
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I teach people how to do basic survival stuff, how to operate a weapon safely, pistol, rifle,

1440
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
long range rifle.

1441
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Go to your people in your local area that know that kind of stuff and train.

1442
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Learn how to be proficient with a weapon.

1443
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
So in case you need to use one, you can.

1444
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Learn some basic survival skills.

1445
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
How much food would you need to store to survive six months with the grid down?

1446
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
What kind of food would you want to store?

1447
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
If you can't cook.

1448
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I mean, other than open flame.

1449
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,000
You know, there's things you need to think about that maybe a lot of people aren't prepared

1450
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
for and wouldn't know what to do.

1451
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
And as soon as they don't have a grocery store to get their things, are they going to be

1452
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
able to function?

1453
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:26,000
I mean, and also be prepared to defend yourself because if you're not, then you're just collecting

1454
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
shit for the toughest guy in your neighborhood, you know?

1455
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
That's a joke that I think Bill Burr said.

1456
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
It's hilarious.

1457
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
He's like, I feel like I'm just collecting shit from the toughest guy in my neighborhood.

1458
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
He started preparing and getting ready.

1459
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
But yeah, so I mean, train, be ready, be aware.

1460
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Well, I think there was that moment right when the pandemic hit.

1461
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Right.

1462
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:52,000
COVID-19 where it was like all of a sudden we didn't quite know what the thing was.

1463
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
We were like all like about to lock down.

1464
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:01,000
And there was this extremely ominous feeling of like, is this actually the end of like

1465
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
the U.S. as we know it?

1466
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Yeah.

1467
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
It ended up not really being that.

1468
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:11,000
But I think keeping that little sense memory in mind is probably a healthy thing.

1469
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I mean, that was a real minor flu comparatively to anything serious.

1470
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Well, we didn't learn any less.

1471
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Right.

1472
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:26,000
So like the lessons would be we should produce our own PPE protective equipment in the U.S.

1473
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Yes.

1474
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,000
We were dependent on the country from which COVID came for protective equipment.

1475
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
And they were tapped because they were using it.

1476
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Totally.

1477
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:40,000
So like at the very least, like, you know, we traded self-sufficiency for basically cheaper

1478
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
TVs on the coast.

1479
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Over and over and over again.

1480
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Over and over again.

1481
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:50,000
And so like some sort of lesson around, you know, internal self-sufficiency, sovereignty

1482
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:55,000
and, you know, rebuilding the American manufacturing base should have been the bare minimum takeaway.

1483
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
And it feels like we've done none of that.

1484
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:04,000
And in April or May of 2020, you have, you know, chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell,

1485
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:10,000
saying, let's print an F ton of money and just infuse, you know, our system.

1486
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,000
And you have this thing called the Cantillion effect where that just accrues directly to

1487
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
equities, to the equity holding class.

1488
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
The rich got way richer.

1489
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
The amount of billionaires, I don't know if it's doubled or, you know, by an order of

1490
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,000
magnitude expanded and then, you know, the rest of the country sort of left on, you know,

1491
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
UBI for a temporary period.

1492
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,000
And like, you know, a lot of businesses got gutted.

1493
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
And so talk about not learning the lesson, right?

1494
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I mean, it's almost like we got redirected.

1495
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,000
And then simultaneous to all of that, I think some spiritual energy entered.

1496
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,000
And I think we're sort of moved off our zombie path.

1497
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
And I think we've awoken to real truths.

1498
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I like the way you put that, man.

1499
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I kind of feel like that too.

1500
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I feel definitely more awake in more recent times from all this.

1501
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Totally.

1502
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Oh, more aware.

1503
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I didn't feel like I was this aware of everything before.

1504
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Right?

1505
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
I mean, it feels different.

1506
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Same.

1507
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:15,000
And I think it's, do you experience it being, for me, it's been harder but better and rewarding.

1508
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:22,000
And so it was almost like initially, especially you feel like, you know,

1509
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
you're undergoing like hard changes to make yourself a better person.

1510
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Yeah.

1511
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
But then on the other end of that, you're like, oh, my God.

1512
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
It was like almost like you were a zombie before.

1513
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,000
And you're kind of awake to all these realities in a really positive way.

1514
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
100%.

1515
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Yeah.

1516
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Exactly how I feel.

1517
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Absolutely.

1518
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Well, I hope the world wakes up, man.

1519
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,000
And I think by you telling your story, I know you're going to play it down,

1520
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:55,000
but I do think you are just adding to this renaissance of consciousness and thought and ideas

1521
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
as far as people knowing that there's a lot more out there.

1522
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Yeah, man.

1523
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
And our reality is just fine.

1524
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
We don't need to upload to the cloud.

1525
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
That's right.

1526
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
You know?

1527
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
That's right.

1528
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:15,000
If our reality is as strange as involving gauntlets emitting hieroglyphics and orbs levitating,

1529
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,000
we should figure that stuff out before we drop into the Sims.

1530
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:24,000
And just bear with it a little bit until January, because who knows?

1531
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Yeah.

1532
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Let's see what happens.

1533
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Hopefully they don't just information dump a bunch of shit that screws up our reality.

1534
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
I'm with you in that.

1535
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And yeah, I wonder how much any of that comes out dovetails with what you have to say,

1536
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:46,000
because I think what's interesting about all of this is it all corroborates and it all checks.

1537
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:52,000
And you speak to Grush, and it's like he'll bring up these names of the people who started the clearance

1538
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,000
system for UFOs, like Robert Starbacher and Oppenheimer.

1539
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
And then you do all this open source research.

1540
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:03,000
You start to build this narrative of like the last 75 years of our history from like a US government

1541
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
perspective is not what it seems.

1542
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:10,000
And then simultaneous to that, you have this promise from the new Trump administration to

1543
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:15,000
disclose all of these kind of dark truths in the American past.

1544
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Let's see.

1545
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Let's see.

1546
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Hopefully he does.

1547
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
But let's see.

1548
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Yeah, right.

1549
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
A lot of presidents have promised us.

1550
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Well, and the traditional thing is that you go up against the power structure.

1551
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
JFK wanted to scatter the CIA to the winds.

1552
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Look at what happened to him.

1553
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Nixon wanted to reduce the CIA by a third as force reduction.

1554
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:38,000
And there are some interesting narratives as to how he might have been kind of pushed out.

1555
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Four of the five burglars at Watergate were CIA agents.

1556
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
That's wild.

1557
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Yeah, kind of wild.

1558
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
So I don't know.

1559
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
We'll see it play out.

1560
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
It's going to get interesting, though.

1561
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
It certainly is, man.

1562
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Be prepared, everyone.

1563
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Well, Randy, this has been a pleasure, man.

1564
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Honored that you gave me the time here.

1565
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
And I'm excited for people to see this.

1566
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:03,000
And hopefully we learn something maybe from the aftermath of all the independent

1567
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:09,000
researchers out there looking into the hieroglyphic symbols, the levitating orb.

1568
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,000
It's almost like your story begets more questions than answers.

1569
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
But I think that's often the case.

1570
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Yeah.

1571
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Awesome, man.

1572
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Well, sir, appreciate me, you know, with you and working with you here.

1573
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
And thank you so much, man.

1574
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Right back at you.

1575
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
All right.

1576
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Was Randy shown this technology as a weapons expert to see if he could figure it out,

1577
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:37,000
reverse engineer it on the spot, as a litmus test to see how an exposed adversary might react?

1578
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
In many ways, this interview begets more questions than answers.

1579
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
But three things are clear.

1580
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Number one, Randy's credentials and background are beyond reproach.

1581
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And we have an abundance of artifacts to prove that.

1582
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Number two, we should be infinitely grateful for his courage in speaking out about his experience.

1583
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:01,000
And number three, this story is unequivocally worthy of follow ups and further investigation.

1584
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I want to thank Randy for his courage and selflessness in speaking out.

1585
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:10,000
If anyone needs help with self-defense, self-sufficiency or disaster preparation in the Vegas area,

1586
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
please reach out to him at Bravo One Defense on Instagram.

1587
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Until next time, I'm Jesse Michaels and this is American Alchemy.
