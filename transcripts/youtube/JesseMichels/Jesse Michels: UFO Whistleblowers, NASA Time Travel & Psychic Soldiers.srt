1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,120
what's up jesse michaels what's up danny jones like i just said to you bro you're gonna have

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:20,200
to pull me back into the believer make me a believer again because the more i learn

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:29,800
about ufos the more i am just out on this topic lately that's understandable and i'm

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:37,280
not here to bring you back i'm not an evangelist i do think damn it i'm sorry i do think if the

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,360
question is is the topic worthy of further investigation and is there something very

6
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,400
interesting at the bottom of all of this you know you get to the final room is there something

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,840
interesting going on my answer would be i think i think yes um but yeah not i don't want to

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,560
evangelize i think in many ways interest in ufos is maladaptive and a distraction for a lot of

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,920
people and doesn't make sense yes yes there's a lot of you got to cut through bro like not just

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,160
the if you want to talk about like psyop stuff like sure there's a lot of stuff you got to cut

11
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:16,040
through with that but then there's a whole nother layer of of people monetizing this there's a

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:22,960
business right yep like there's we're doing a podcast in a spaceship about ufos because my

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,640
audience loves ufos and i'm gonna make money talking about ufos half the books on that on

14
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,760
that shelf are about ufos so it's it's a huge business too yeah which muddies the water even

15
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,880
more yeah it totally muddies the water and it's it's a weird dynamic and i i think when you have

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,960
a topic that's kind of pointing at the sacred you know it's it might be the tip of the iceberg

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,480
it's not the rest of the iceberg like it's just an unidentified flying object is not necessarily

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,840
what you're going for i think a lot of people that are into it are like ultimately meaning

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,760
seekers and they want like a kind of a they want to understand the reality of religion they want

20
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:09,240
to understand metaphysics and so i think ufos are just a foray they're just one kind of route in but

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,440
i think combining that with money is a very weird thing i mean then it's like sort of the modern

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,360
modern catholic indulgences or something it doesn't doesn't really work right yeah totally

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so we were just talking before we started rolling about that movie the adjustment bureau

24
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,880
and there's some crazy people like some deep dark secretive people in this whole ufo world that

25
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:42,040
aren't public that i guess we can talk about the guy right like he's a he's fully the reason i'm

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,040
scared to talk about this guy yeah is because my puck i say with chris bledsoe yeah completely got

27
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,200
nuked off youtube yeah do you should we tell this story because you told me some really interesting

28
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:59,640
stuff on a phone call i did yeah what did i tell you well you said that you said i don't care okay

29
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,320
cool um you said that uh the views were like you know it was like doing 50k a day oh yes and then

30
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:11,160
it cuts off yeah you speak to some rep at google and they're like we don't know what the hell

31
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,440
happened here doesn't make any sense given the click-through rate average view duration which

32
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,080
should basically define the video's performance he goes the one other time i've seen this is

33
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,160
with jesse's david grush video exactly performance fell off a cliff yep so and he said that he said

34
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,680
that my video with bledsoe and your video with grush neither of them broke any youtube rules or

35
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,480
had any internal red flags that he was able to see yep and he goes whenever this happens

36
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,600
which has happened one other time recently with david grush yep it's basically the floor above me

37
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,680
that i have no access to yep some something above my head that i don't know what the hell is going

38
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:53,560
on so what the hell is going on why are they why are they doing this erasing podcasts with

39
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,040
people who talk about getting abducted by aliens off of the internet i feel like they have way

40
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,280
bigger fish to fry you would think i i don't know um there's something very interesting about chris

41
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,800
bledsoe's story it's like why is you know jim semivan is very high up at the cia why is he

42
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,560
showing up at chris bledsoe's you know place in fayetteville north carolina when when he's you

43
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,040
know starts to kind of attract ufos he talks to the lady or whatever you know the whole story

44
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,760
he's definitely attracted the attention of some very interesting people you know we were just

45
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,560
talking about you know tim taylor yes that's the guy i would always mention pseudonymously he was

46
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,120
written about in this great book by dana pesolka religious studies professor called american

47
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,160
cosmic and then he was kind of doxed by chris bledsoe on your show actually right which i

48
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,520
thought that that might have been the reason that that video got completely blasted off the face of

49
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,640
youtube because of him talking about him right because if i'm that guy yeah and i have all these

50
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,360
connections that he allegedly has yeah i could probably make a call or send an email to somebody

51
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,480
youtube being like nuke this thing totally yeah well that's what and bledsoe even says in the

52
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,720
story that tim taylor gives him a whole brief about ufos and then he says you can't send this

53
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,120
to anybody and then he like sends the email or something to his wife or like i don't somebody

54
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,160
very close and immediately gets a call from tim being like knowing that he forwarded it yeah like

55
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,520
he fucked up yeah and so you know who knows if that's like a test and like you know they're

56
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,840
sort of being psyoped or you know i don't i think even bledsoe thinks that you know maybe he was

57
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,240
being messed with initially when he sort of entered his life and even when he was i think

58
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,360
he was giving him a tour of like kennedy space center oh yeah he said he said when you walk

59
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,640
through the security yeah when you walk past the security tower he goes just play a song in your

60
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,920
head yeah so they can't access your thoughts so they can't access your thoughts right yeah and

61
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,440
i asked him like what yeah i'm like who's in there yeah and he he was very he didn't know he's like

62
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,760
mind readers i don't know i don't know if they're aliens or humans but they they read your minds

63
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,000
and then he also said some that i'm like i don't even know if i want to say on camera but he like

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,400
say it danny he told me some stuff okay essentially i'll make it i'll dumb it down

65
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,880
so it's not too technical but he basically told me that this fella showed him

66
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:16,360
a real life men in black neuralyzer no way that wipes your memory no way this is what he told me

67
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,920
how can you know it's a neuralyzer we actually cut the segment out of the podcast because i

68
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,560
was like there's no way i'm putting this on the podcast it was like a five it was like a

69
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,680
10-minute chunk of that bledsoe podcast where he explains yeah everything about it how it works

70
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,520
where they got it from no way yeah bro why didn't they neuralyze him after they described

71
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,520
the whole thing that would seem like you would think they would want to do that right yeah but

72
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,880
like that is like essentially is like one of the explanations for the missing time stuff and he had

73
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,440
another story about like missing time where they were like walking through a forest yep i'm not

74
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,040
familiar with that one but like they were walking him and tim were walking through a forest with

75
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,640
somebody like looking for something and then all of a sudden that like they started over

76
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,040
whoa like they almost like started back to where they were an hour ago with like

77
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,000
like in an instant like almost it was like a loop like they looped through time or something

78
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,880
it's fascinating i don't know well i just you know we were talking earlier about i did a piece on

79
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,040
this guy thomas townsend brown who i think is just a fascinating character one of the best

80
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,000
documentaries i've ever seen thank you man is incredible appreciate that um yeah well he's

81
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,280
he's amazing he's uh i think like a forgotten hero in american history i think he made all

82
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,000
sorts of breakthroughs and in the world of gravity but in general relativity gravity and time are

83
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,960
related so the kind of subplot of his whole biography it's a great biography called the man

84
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,080
who mastered gravity by a guy named paul shatskin recommend you all read it um the subplot is that

85
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,360
he's obsessed with time travel he talks about time travel constantly with his wife josephine

86
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:57,240
his daughter linda and here's where it gets really weird uh apparently tim taylor told chris

87
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,720
bledsoe that he was part of a secret time travel group in nassau in the bahamas and the president

88
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,760
of that group was thomas townsend brown now i would think that was total i would dismiss that

89
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,520
out of hand i would be like that's you know that's sort of you know madness but i know from my own

90
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,200
research independent research on thomas townsend brown he spent a ton of time in nassau in the

91
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,840
bahamas and he was just extremely interested in time travel and it was he was spending a lot of

92
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,640
time with this guy william stevenson who was james bond's super spy or sorry he was the

93
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,200
inspiration for james bond he was winston churchill's super spy but he was you know

94
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,280
ian flumming's inspiration for james bond he's just like fascinating kind of he's you know

95
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,200
coordinating a lot with wild bill donovan early oss or late oss you know early cia involved in

96
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,280
the formation of the cia was working out of the rockefeller center in new york and kind of calling

97
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:54,040
a lot of interesting shots as you know almost part of like a shadow government if you will so

98
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,440
he's close with thomas townsend brown there in the bahamas a lot and then you have you know ryan

99
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,800
bloodsoe saying that tim taylor told his father that he's part of the secret time travel group

100
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,120
with thomas townsend brown just very very interesting and then and then you you know we

101
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,960
were talking about this before the show you said uh you know that tim taylor told chris bloodsoe

102
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,720
that the adjustment bureau was like you know yeah his life or whatever and that's all about like

103
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,120
changing one little variable like it's like if i were to freeze this room and like i don't know

104
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,840
move your mic like a little bit right and you get this butterfly butterfly effect style multiplicative

105
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,760
effect down the line or whatever of like you know changing timelines it's madness it sounds kind of

106
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:43,640
crazy madness science fiction it is sci-fi and i'm not proposing that that's you know a real thing

107
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,680
but it it is fascinating that there are some connections there and then the final thing the

108
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:54,520
final connection i made is townsend brown's daughter uh is a an amazing woman uh she was

109
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,600
in the documentary right she's in the documentary on the phone call and her name's linda brown but

110
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,920
it was linda leach uh for a while and she has an amazon review on tim taylor's biography tim

111
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:12,360
taylor's biography is called launch fever and i think he wrote 2003 2004 right and in 20

112
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:21,080
12 or 13 or 14 like early well before diana pusulka even pseudonymously published about tim taylor

113
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:29,640
under the pseudonym tyler in american cosmic in 2018 linda leach is writing a review on launch

114
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,040
fever saying this is you know wonderful homage to you know the the space program or whatever so

115
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:41,320
clearly there's a connection between townsend brown and tim taylor which is that's it's pretty

116
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:48,200
interesting yeah yeah so you have this mid-century inventor who i i think i mean at the very least

117
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,880
like we have an fbi file on thomas townsend brown saying he was the the lead radar scientist

118
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,000
in the entire navy like this guy's a real guy you can say he didn't crack anti-gravity that's

119
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,160
fine i'm like totally open to that like you have to think probabilistically around that i have a

120
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,440
lot of evidence that he did you can but you say he didn't do that or whatever he's like a very

121
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,160
real guy and he's talking about time travel constantly and then there's this really interesting

122
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:20,040
connection with a modern nasa mission controller i don't know i don't understand it yeah going to

123
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:29,240
the like the adjustment bureau comment that he made do you think that there's a thing that happens

124
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,000
to people and i wouldn't know because i don't have the personal experience but do you think

125
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
it's possible there's something that happens to somebody or certain individuals when they have

126
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:50,120
tons of super super top secret information that they have and nobody else has where they sort of

127
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,720
feel like their life is for lack of a better term they're living the da vinci code

128
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,000
and they sort of like fall into that and they sort of like look through their entire life at that

129
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,200
through that lens right like like i am living i am living this movie or like i am the superhero

130
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,440
character because i hold these secrets that like literally would change the power balance of the

131
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,560
world if i let them out yeah i wonder what that does to your brain you know what i mean i want i

132
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,960
do wonder that as well and then i wonder how much of it is like human clearance systems versus like

133
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,640
have you ever experienced synchronicities in your life oh all the time popping up showing up like

134
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,800
really in really cool interesting fun way so maybe there are people that are more tapped into that

135
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,400
in a and sort of a weird way you know that's what this guy tries to do right he's trying to tap into

136
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,200
this this other thing he's trying to get these downloads that she's in her new book she talks

137
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,680
about like yeah all these diana pusulka in her new i forget the name of her new book she taught

138
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,760
in that one she talks about encounters yeah that's great awesome book um about diana shout out to

139
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:05,240
diana um all these protocols that he goes through every day by not drinking coffee

140
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,280
yep and like going outside getting sunlight and all this stuff in the morning and like

141
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:16,920
trying to download some sort of cosmic shit so we can make more patents yeah it sounds so

142
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,960
and wild and like you know i don't i don't know what to say about it um i think that's more how

143
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,680
thinking works than the average person realize it you know i'm a big fan of the transmission

144
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,600
theory of consciousness i don't when you're daydreaming you're not actively producing those

145
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,360
thoughts right it's like you're like you're like a receptacle for the thoughts and uh so i think

146
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,960
it's just like it's an important kind of epistemological question is are we locally

147
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,040
producing the content in our minds or are we somehow downloading them from elsewhere yeah sure

148
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,440
i think that is probably going to be proven by some sort of you know scientific model of the

149
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,120
future right now electromagnetism as we know it decays over and attenuates over spacetime so we

150
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,760
don't have a good model for like how that transmission might occur you know like neutrino

151
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:08,040
information transfer but uh increasingly in vogue is this extended electrodynamics model which

152
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:15,720
uh you know nasa and uh not the doe the national science foundation nasa just launched this podcast

153
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,840
and like how put off and all these interesting like kind of figures in ufo world but also

154
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:27,000
with some pretty impressive bona fides just in science as well uh you got a former skunkworks guy

155
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,600
you know um some navy scientists all righty fellas it's time to talk about personal grooming

156
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,000
which is not just about looking good it's about feeling good whether it's gearing up for a meeting

157
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,720
getting ready to go on a date or just preparing for the day the right tools make all the difference

158
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,520
take care of your skin and skip the cuts and irritation meet the beard and balls bundle from

175
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,600
speaking about extended electrodynamics and this is basically a model that involves a scalar field

176
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:21,240
so unlike classical electrodynamics you don't get the attenuation over space time so you can have

177
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,840
you can have it basically in classical electrodynamics you just have one electromagnetic

178
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:31,720
wave a transverse hertzian wave so you have a magnetic field an electric field and wave

179
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,880
propagation and all three are perpendicular to one another and so because of that you get this

180
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,440
attenuation you get electrons pairing off you know and you know you get this decay function on

181
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,400
the signal but in the scalar field you can get like scalar longitudinal waves you get all these

182
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:52,840
interesting wave types and you don't get the same decay and so maybe we are downloading thoughts

183
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,400
via one of these sort of scalar field waves that would just be one thought experiment i don't know

184
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,320
right but i do think something like that will get proven out just given the phenomenology of thought

185
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,880
or invention where like a wheel pops up in africa at the same time as south america yes this this

186
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,600
you look at the phenomenology of science it looks way more like revelation than it does like

187
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,840
mechanics or something it looks like something's popping into the person's head every single time

188
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,400
whether it's dirac staring at the fire at cambridge coming up with the dirac equation or einstein at

189
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,160
his desk as a patent clerk like it literally it's the exception to the rule is like i just finished

190
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,520
the equation on the whiteboard no you're like in the shower you're like uh there's so many examples

191
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,680
so yeah i think you know heisenberg at helgoland you know making all these downloads about you know

192
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,800
how how you know electrons make quantum leaps and you know electron cloud like it's just it's sort

193
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:52,520
of constant so i so tim taylor saying that it's like yeah i think that's real but and then and

194
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,560
then i don't know it's hard to sift through some of the other quackiness i'm not i don't want to

195
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,560
endorse any of the stuff that he says it's definitively real but it's interesting he seems

196
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,720
like the most i mean it's because he's so elusive i think is making it makes him so interesting

197
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,640
yes you know especially the way she talks about some of the stuff that he was involved with like

198
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,640
like you've met the dude right yeah i had it i had like a 20 minute call with him really yeah how did

199
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:20,280
that come about uh i can't say because i will say anything on any podcast i'll always be public but

200
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,280
i want to protect sources yeah sources exactly i just don't want to like burn relationships sure

201
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,720
can you tell what you talked about him with what you talked about with him um yeah well

202
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:39,720
the impetus on my end so i always i invest um and i'm the venture capitalist steven did you

203
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,520
leave your phone out we gotta put our phones out there we got palantir in the building bro we can't

204
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:51,720
let all our info get sucked out of here dude he's a palantir honey trap jesse michaels i i am i am

205
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:58,120
not i am not you're furthering the internet bullshit daddy come on man just kidding just kidding but

206
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,080
no you you uh what you talked about on julian dory's podcast a great podcast you guys went

207
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,840
into like your whole background into investing and how you you're invest basically you invest

208
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,800
peter teal's money exactly yeah love julian great guy and um yeah so i worked at the the family

209
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:19,800
office for for a long amount of time and even even now um i still have a contract with them and

210
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,560
i do investing and uh but i mainly focus on the show it's like right 90 95 show at this point

211
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:33,240
um but uh yeah so one of the companies that i was invested in was uh you know a rocket company

212
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,480
and they were struggling rocket rocket trees incredibly hard it's it's uh it's got a very

213
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,960
high failure rate yeah yeah yeah it's it's it's absurd i mean the amount of you're talking about

214
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,520
like thousands of sub components and like you know one thing fails and you get this chain reaction

215
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:53,480
the whole thing screws up so uh we had had a you know a couple of failures and i always try to keep

216
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,840
my um you know uh investment stuff and uh you know the the the quacky stuff that i'm into

217
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,920
i always try to keep those separate um for for for many reasons but i'm kind of scraping the

218
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,160
bottom of the barrel as far as you know it's like oh we're struggling to get off the ground

219
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,640
and i know a startup rocket company yeah it's a startup rocket company yeah yeah and so i know

220
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,640
about um you know uh tim taylor being this nasa mission controller he uses consciousness

221
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,120
protocols to get rockets off the ground and i also know about the history of rocketry where it's like

222
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,520
jack parson's the you know founder of jpl and like basically the american rocket program

223
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,960
or tchaikovsky the equivalent in uh russia or warner von braun like all of these guys believed

224
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,600
in versions of this so i'm scraping the bottom of the barrel that's so crazy yeah i basically

225
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,680
like in my you know in putting my investment hat on i'm like i'm a materialist reductionist

226
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:50,440
like i don't want to bring the woo-woo stuff in but again it's you know i i'm like if i have

227
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,000
access to this guy i gotta you know find a way to meet him pretend or pretend i'm not interested in

228
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,960
ufos yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well yeah i actually that

229
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,360
was literally the impetus actually was like helping on the rocket stuff so it actually

230
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,520
wasn't as much like sure the ufo thing right and so yeah we spoke and he said some interesting

231
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,640
stuff he was like he's you know most of it was actually kind of very like like kind of platitudes

232
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,520
around the american cosmic style stuff like you know use these protocols and tap in and like don't

233
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,680
use your phone i was like i already read that in the you know book that basulka you know published

234
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:32,040
but thank you and then um he was also like look if you want the rocket to work you know maybe you

235
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:37,480
have to get aligned with what they want and i was like who is it they yeah like the non-human

236
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,920
intelligence he said this to you knowing that you weren't you didn't bring you didn't bring the

237
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,640
first he brought it up first no i i brought it i oh i didn't bring i bring it didn't bring up

238
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,640
non-human intelligence first he was the one yeah yeah yeah yeah i know i i just asked questions

239
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:56,920
about rocket bless you bless you i just i just i just bless you i just i was just asking questions

240
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:03,080
about the rocket and getting it to work yeah yeah and so did you ask did you follow up on

241
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:09,640
that when he was like they did you ask who they were i don't remember exactly i mean i'm sure i

242
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,320
did um and i'm sure i was sure that when he said they he was talking about non-human intelligence

243
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,360
either due to a follow-up question that i asked or something he made that kind of clear so yeah

244
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,160
i don't know what to make of this stuff man i mean he even said like apparently like

245
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,680
he knows elon right he has to know elon he works for elon and at spacex and like watches the rockets

246
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,800
and supposedly is part of nr o where they have to like watch everything that happens around the

247
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:41,800
rocket with the satellites and drones or whatever i i think so i don't i don't know you know i've

248
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:48,520
heard that and um pusulkas tweeted that and but yeah i think he does work occasionally with with

249
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,560
elon i know he works on some i think you know some serious launches he also works at aerospace

250
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:59,080
corporation which is a very interesting company um so they're sort of like remind me what that

251
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,040
one is they're like a i think they're kind of like a think tank they have like 5 000 employees

252
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:12,600
split between virginia and you know fairfax area and i think that yeah they show up in interesting

253
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:19,880
places around the question for sure aerospace corporation yep yeah yeah i don't know like my

254
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,760
world got turned upside down when when when which i talk about it at nauseam on this show but like

255
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:30,920
when bledsoe came in here and talked about this stuff and then after recently after that i became

256
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:37,560
aware of the mirage man documentary yeah which flipped my world upside down again yeah yeah yeah

257
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,920
and i've been looking at this whole topic through that lens yeah ever since then sure and it really

258
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,520
makes a ton of sense yep well there yeah i mean that's an example of like should we like talk

259
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,440
about so so this guy paul benowitz is outside kirtland air force base he sees this like

260
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:59,000
vertical takeoff and landing occur of probably some exotic you know craft or whatever which

261
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,320
to me doesn't mean look away it's like what is that what's the initial thing you saw

262
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,040
and then rick dotty who's an air force office special investigations officer enters into his

263
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,880
life and kind of drives him crazy and he ends up committing suicide he's driven in a psychiatric

264
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,720
hospitalization he's told that he's communicating with aliens via these

265
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:23,240
signals across the street beaming into his house right telling him they're aliens that are like

266
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,520
running out of gas on their planet and they're on their way here yep yep yeah so pretty pretty

267
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,040
nuts so now like so so after watching the documentary and learning the story this guy

268
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:39,640
paul benowitz and seeing how this this world really works behind the scenes like i have to

269
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,840
just assume that most of this stuff that is going on is just super secret military technology and

270
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:52,040
there's a huge apparatus and bureaucracy of people behind the scenes that are just involved in

271
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,800
making information murkier right and like what they were doing with paul if i understand it

272
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,800
correctly was they were because he was in the ufo field he was part of mufon and all this stuff

273
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,440
so they were trying to use him as a conduit of disinfo to poison the well yep and tried and

274
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,840
because they knew there was also russian spies in the ufo community out west so they thought

275
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,800
okay we can just throw a couple curveballs through paul benowitz it'll throw off the russians and

276
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,880
they won't know what we really have going on yeah so now i look at people like in the media today

277
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,040
like and i don't i'm you're gonna have to explain this up to me better but like people like crush

278
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:32,120
people like all these whistleblowers yeah people like uh bledsoe like okay is he paul benowitz is

279
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,960
he a paul benowitz is he a paul but the thing with bledsoe is like there's like cia people nsa

280
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,400
people inaru people saw like the guy uh that he talked about that mapped the moon for the

281
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,880
apollo missions was like visiting him and like befriending him right and telling him all this

282
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:55,800
secret stuff yep and then like god dude it's just it's too much yeah it's extremely confusing i mean

283
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,080
here's what i would say that seems like a massive waste of resource like to what end

284
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:08,920
right why why why are you why are you um getting all these kind of super high up guys at nasa cia

285
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:15,400
to visit this guy driving to north carolina from from the middle of florida so but that points

286
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,520
to there being some real like proto architecture underneath like there's a different you can try

287
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,920
to you can attempt to manipulate or like shade a thing differently and by the way i'm not saying

288
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,080
i have no evidence that this at all happened right and for example bledsoe's case um and he

289
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:37,720
seems like a really earnest good guy to me and i'm hopefully can go he is very very sweet sweet guy

290
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,240
yeah yeah um but as his daughter she was she was in here with him when he came in awesome yeah

291
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:50,200
their whole family seems really cool um but i think you can have an experience and you can shade that

292
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,720
experience differently versus like you didn't experience anything to begin with because it's

293
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,280
like why are you spending all this like manpower and resources you know like yeah it's like this

294
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:08,040
huge waste of resources otherwise and so if it's all passage material or all some honey trap or

295
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:13,720
like i just that feels like a little crazy to me and then you have all this you have like so you

296
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,520
have to think probabilistically with all this stuff sure so like there's the stuff where the

297
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,120
adjustment like the crazy stuff like to me i hold that extremely loosely i catalog it as very low

298
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,280
probability and i'll look for corroboration in the future for it but like if you're like do you

299
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,000
believe that's definitely a thing i know i don't have no idea right right but then you have things

300
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,840
like you have this book called ufos and nukes by a guy named robert hastings and he documented

301
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:44,200
we've talked about this he documents 167 queue cleared icbm security personnel radar operators

302
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,720
guys that most psychologically sound people in the military right they're on the prp program

303
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,040
the personal reliability program where they have to report if they're taking ibuprofen or tylenol

304
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:00,120
they inherently have to be the the the paradigm of a sound mind because you're guarding the crown

305
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,720
jewels like you would never let you know crazy person right next to a nuke right right um and

306
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:13,000
and in certain cases they have their finger on the button uh and so uh all these guys see tic tacs

307
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,360
saucers orbs often they're messing with comms links shutting down the nukes rendering them

308
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:25,480
inoperable in the case of you know malmstrom 67 robert solace um uh in you know 64 vandenberg

309
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,880
you have a nuke wrapping around an atlas 5 dummy missile and taking it out of the sky

310
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,880
and then you have air force office of special investigations people like rick doty in fact

311
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,840
rick doty is literally one of these people who shows up with this guy mario woods at elsworth

312
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,920
air force base in 1977 and swearing them to secrecy and saying you never talk about this

313
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,720
again and and demoting them in cases where they do come out when they speak to robert hastings

314
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,160
robert hastings getting threatening phone calls and so to me if you were to you know like you

315
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,320
have to think about everything is like a database and it's like okay there's one thing if you have

316
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:05,880
like the you know national ufo reporting center or move on it's another thing if you have this

317
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,240
you know database that which i would call ufos and nukes of these inherently very credible people

318
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,360
coming forward saying they've seen things yes and then did you know sleeping less than six

319
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:21,560
hours per night nearly doubles your risk of death poor sleep is also linked to obesity heart disease

320
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,120
high blood pressure diabetes depression and weakened immune system i've struggled with sleep

321
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,800
for a while and i'm not alone the cdc reports over 35 percent of adults in the u.s sleep less

322
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,440
than the recommended seven hours many sleep supplements contain melatonin and other ingredients

323
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,840
that create dependencies cause morning grogginess and lose their effectiveness over time and that

324
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:46,440
is why i take evening being by verso after three years of perfecting the formula they created a

325
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,280
melatonin free drink mix with clinically studied patented ingredients it's formulated to an active

326
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,360
mind helps you fall asleep faster stay asleep longer and improves deep and REM sleep without

327
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:04,120
creating dependencies or causing morning grogginess i look forward to my evening being nightcap every

328
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,880
night now and it's become a staple in my nightly routine because it not only helps me stay asleep

329
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:15,160
longer fall asleep faster but i wake up with far more energy i hop out of bed quicker and in a

330
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,400
better mood and it tastes great which is why it's become my new nightcap click the link in the

sponsoring the show you could say oh okay well it's just some u.s deep state cabal thing like

335
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,200
okay maybe but the even then your null hypothesis gets pretty fantastical and weird if that's what

336
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:56,360
you're saying but then you look at fukushima leno which is a town right next to fukushima

337
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,520
next to the pre-fracture where they have their civilian energy nuclear energy grid and they've

338
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:08,280
had it there since the 70s they're famous for their nuclear spill in 2011 right and in the 90s they

339
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,720
built a museum dedicated to ufos and vice did a documentary about how obsessed the townspeople

340
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,800
are with ufos and it's probably due to the nuclear energy presence and you have a famous

341
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,480
case in bariloche argentina where they have their civilian civilian nuclear grid where you know a

342
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,800
commercial pilot sees a ufo and you have stories around ternobyl and so this nuclear connection

343
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:38,360
is extremely important then you hear about ufos basically being bound up within nuclear secrecy

344
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:44,760
and betel memorial institute being you know very big part of ufo research you look at the special

345
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,960
definition of nuclear material under the atomic energy commission which was in 1954 and it's

346
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,720
basically any material with emitting any sort of radiation so alpha beta gamma radio anything

347
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,960
is born secret and it's restricted data meaning that you don't even have to fall under the direct

348
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,800
clearances of government if you are a private aerospace corporation and you pick this stuff up

349
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:14,680
it is restricted for you too so it's like born classified so you have all this evidence that

350
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:20,840
there's this kind of like doe atomic research ufo thing that's been going on for for very long time

351
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,800
and i think that's where you have to start this coherent picture and then yeah there's psyops

352
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:32,280
there's weird shit but i think what people don't understand is that um if there are psyops around

353
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,840
a thing it means the thing is more likely to be real how many oh sure how many big foot psyops do

354
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,600
you know none yeah because nobody would fucking believe it right psyops are 95 true and five

355
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,320
percent false and the five percent that's false matters a ton because it throws you entirely off

356
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,320
the trail it's it's 95 true yes five percent false yes oh really that's what people don't

357
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,800
understand about psyops they think they thought it was the opposite that's sure they think that

358
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:03,000
it's 95 false but you you dismiss it out of hand if it was 95 false you'd be like oh it's big foot

359
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,560
fuck them i don't i'm not gonna believe that ufos are standard deviations more charismatic than any

360
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:16,360
other if it's the psyop well big foot's big foot's more more believable than a fucking alien coming

361
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,160
here from another universe right it's a hominid there's a big hominid right right right which is

362
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,720
why and i i actually i'm i'm more in the like joc valet dina pusulka line of thinking where i

363
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,080
don't think you know little green men from zeta reticuli is the answer to like what we're seeing

364
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,760
in in you know the airspace shout out to mike masters shout to mike masters yeah i love mike

365
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,480
man and he does some really important work my favorite he's amazing yeah and he's he's great

366
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,280
because he's he's thinking about this stuff inductively most people don't realize they're

367
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:54,360
bringing priors into thinking about ufos that deal with movies they've seen and that zeitgeist and

368
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:00,040
culture and so they're not looking at the phenomena ground up first principles and he is and that's

369
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,680
why mike masters is amazing yep and people should definitely follow him yeah but that's what people

370
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:11,720
don't so the psi just i think i think is a really important point um if if there are psyops around a

371
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:18,760
thing it's more likely to be real and then if ufos are real there are going to be psyops around it

372
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,120
obviously if you have this like core important truth they're going to be psyops around it yeah

373
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:29,080
if you're talking about the nature of reality obviously and but it's ephemeral and hard to

374
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,760
detect and it's like this thing that happens only to certain people of course you're going

375
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,600
to co-op that manipulate it for narratives and you're going to have all these competing

376
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:42,760
factions trying to like overlay their narratives on top of the thing yeah so these things are

377
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,600
psyop or real is positive sum it's not zero sum the fact that it's real means there's going to be

378
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,680
a psyop the fact that there's a psyop probably means there's an element of reality too why would

379
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,160
why else would they invest manpower into it why would they invest so much manpower at the highest

380
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,440
levels right and so that's i think people don't get that and they're they snap it to grid they're

381
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,800
like this is a psyop or this is real and it's like no there are psyops and it's real it's the same

382
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,680
it's both and that makes it really interesting yes and worthy of investigation everybody should

383
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,520
think for themselves and you should distrust anybody who's saying it's definitely this

384
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,880
that's why the the um the bob lazar story is so interesting to me and it stays interesting

385
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,920
because like the more we learn about the more we learn about the psychological warfare and the

386
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,440
counterintelligence stuff like in this current ufo state we're in the more light it shines on

387
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,240
the bob lazar story in what was it 1980 or something 1990 what was it 87 87 yep so like

388
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,360
apparently he was the guy who first came to area 51 blew the whistle in area 51

389
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,080
but then i think this this was all part of your um documentary was this a part of your towns and

390
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,160
brown documentary it was yeah yeah so like i think one of the questions you ask in the towns and

391
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:06,040
brown document which was which was brilliant was why would the cia let a guy come in who has this

392
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,640
crazy history yep right he i think and another thing that happened was i think he like recently

393
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:18,520
gotten a divorce with with his previous wife who then like killed herself i didn't know that she

394
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:25,720
she she like went in her car in her garage and let her car run until like she suffocated

395
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,760
this was like a week after they got a divorce oh no i think bob also owned a strip club in vegas

396
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,680
yeah i know that yeah yeah he did and then what were they were i think a brothel not not just

397
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:40,360
oh it was a brothel yeah yeah yeah and a brothel so the cia is gonna go out and find it and to

398
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,040
think they're not gonna do a background check and find that kind of stuff if it's the cia at their

399
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:49,400
most top secret facility on in america well you've seen oppenheimer right yeah so you remember

400
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,280
that leslie matt damon's character leslie groves yes who's running basically the the entire matt

401
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:00,520
and hatton project from like a national security standpoint and he says i didn't hire uh uh

402
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:06,920
oppenheimer in spite of his socialist sympathies i hired him because of them and so you hire you

403
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,320
hire people when it comes to some of these more secret programs sometimes if they do have

404
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,440
compromise on them because they're more easily controllable so that wouldn't necessarily cut

405
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,640
against so the whole bob lazar story for them that's an argument for them hiring him okay

406
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:27,400
but and discrediting him if he ever decides to spill the beans yeah and there's there's even a

407
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:35,800
so what i was saying in that documentary is john leer is a cia cargo pilot cargo jet pilot or

408
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:41,640
whatever right uh and the the the son of bill lear who created the first uh you know a business uh

409
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,480
basically private jet in the in the u.s who's known as the autopilot wizard and actually worked

410
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,800
with thomas towns and brown who comes from this like aerospace like you know dynasty right and he

411
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,120
yeah affiliated with the cia and says he disaffiliated in 83 but definitely was still

412
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:04,600
flying cargo jets for them like into the mid 80s at least so my question is like you know we we

413
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:10,840
kind of know that if there is a ufo program it's being run partially by the cia and the cia has a

414
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,560
part in it and so if you're the cia why do you continue unless you're extremely dysfunctional

415
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:21,800
and not coordinated why do you continue to pay this guy you know he's flying cargo jets for you

416
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:28,360
if he's leaking your most vital important secrets because john leer put all of the files around bob

417
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,880
lazar on george napp's desk he broke the story yeah so why would you pay a guy who's leaking your

418
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,440
you know your crown jewel secrets so that that's one question and then john leer also had a ufo

419
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:46,360
blog before and was friends with bob lazar and there's some story that bob lazar says all this

420
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:52,120
ufo stuff's crazy and wacky and bullshit before he gets hired by area 51 and s4 but the question

421
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:59,400
stands why would you hire bob lazar to your top secret ufo reverse engineering program if

422
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:07,480
your good friend or his good friend john leer was a babbling ufo nut who has a ufo blog

423
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,680
like you'd obviously find that in a background check right yeah so like

424
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:18,600
there's a lot to me that points to the cia wanting the bob lazar story out again that doesn't mean

425
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:25,240
the details of the bob lazar story are not incredibly interesting and maybe it's 95

426
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:31,240
true and 5 false and maybe this billy meyers sports model that he worked on was real i don't

427
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:38,440
know maybe gravity a and gravity b are high level frameworks that if you are working on a secret ufo

428
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,680
program you need some initiate you know stem student to start to develop an entry an interest

429
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,880
in but you need to protect this from getting into adversary hands so you put it out through these

430
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,280
kind of this quacky person who is discreditable in bob lazar and so it's kind of this limited

431
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,880
hangout of a person where you can always retract it you can always point to you know you say faked

432
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,280
is mit you know educational credentials yeah and you could say you'd say all this stuff about

433
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,720
bob you say the the the brothel thing but maybe there are elements of it that you know are are

434
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,840
very real so i think it's this incredibly intriguing story and what i want to be clear

435
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,080
about is i think like the corbell and george napp reporting on it are awesome like i think it's

436
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,640
we should be looking into this stuff but to me if you're not thinking about it through a

437
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,800
a meta lens of like the cia probably wanted elements of this out i think you're losing the plot

438
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,600
you know i think you're going to fall for your you can't take the thing at face value you need

439
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,280
to understand that it's being pushed for some reason and i think there's even a john lear

440
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,560
interview where i believe he says a guy named i think it was like an admiral mcclellan he says

441
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:52,520
that this guy who was part of like legacy ufo efforts told him that he needed to leak the

442
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:59,080
lazar story because he knew that it was discreditable but that there were it was mostly true but also

443
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,120
discreditable and so there's there's literally a lear interview because lear was clearly kind

444
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:09,640
of unhinged and a little you know crazy himself where he's just saying what i'm telling you now

445
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,760
which is that the lazar story again there could be elements of truth but it was put out because

446
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,560
it was discreditable and i think that's the way a lot of this stuff works so what was the benefit

447
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,760
of putting it out was it to recruit new talent was it tons it's it's yeah so it's like if you

448
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:30,760
want to throw the adversary off the trail or like keep things fundamentally protected but have

449
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,440
initiates you know develop intrigue and want to be recruited or whatever like it's like the perfect

450
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:42,840
way to do it yeah so it's like tech protection it's adversary signaling it's recruitment it's

451
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,560
increasing the surface area it's if you expect a leak in the future you can manage that leak

452
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,480
because you're like conditioning people and like softening the blow for something you expect to

453
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:57,000
leak in the future anyways there's so many reasons to get in front of and do something

454
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,120
like that and ben rich who was you know president of of lockheed skunkworks you know their most

455
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:07,000
secretive you know advanced aerospace aircraft division at the time responsible for you know

456
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:15,240
the sr-71 and you know you too he was complaining at the time how he was basically saying like

457
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:20,360
you know i have to spend tons and tons of money on tech protection because the f-117a which was

458
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,640
their first stealth fighter had just crashed in bakersfield in 1986 lear actually established

459
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:31,880
credibility with klas with george napp's you know news station by giving them information on that

460
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,240
f-117a oh wow yeah so there's some interesting ties there the the final thing is john lear

461
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:42,600
and jim goodall his buddy had been camping outside of area 51 for the better part of a decade

462
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:49,080
taking pictures of all these advanced recon stealth craft and so the security knew him

463
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:54,200
they know they all knew who he was so it's like if he's leaking stuff it's probably for a reason

464
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,120
and so i think you know people like ben rich were smart really smart he used to get ben rich used

465
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:05,080
to call ufos unfunded opportunities and i think you know he was kind of using john lear to those

466
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:10,600
ends if that makes sense again i don't know if you have to throw the baby out with the bath water and

467
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:17,080
say that we're not you know reverse engineering ufos and in sort of you know secret compartments

468
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:22,120
of the government but that's the way you i think you need that meta lens to look at it through if

469
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:27,720
that makes sense and on my list on my on top of my to-do list is read the book that jock

470
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,360
fillet wrote about this stuff where he talks about bob lozare drinking something weird or something

471
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:37,160
like that yeah messengers of deception jock fillet jock fillet is always i've had a bunch of

472
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,840
conversation i love that guy you know french godfather of ufos right and he's always thought

473
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,960
bob lozare was like just completely full of shit which which i do i think there are more elements

474
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,440
of truth to it and there's actually a great movie coming out about bob lozare by my buddy luigi and

475
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,640
it's called project gravatar and i do think it's actually going to corroborate that lozare probably

476
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:05,720
was at area 51 i just yeah and then he's working on it with lozare he's working on it with lozare

477
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,840
yeah it's gonna be epic it's gonna be really awesome but yeah so in messengers of deception

478
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:19,080
uh jock fillet says you know uh and what about the the the liquid that that bob lozare said he was

479
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,880
you know meant to drink or whatever and the memory lapses that it caused and immediately my mind goes

480
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,560
to mk ultra and i'm like yeah you know and and and i i lozare admits that and i think he's admitted

481
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,480
it to luigi and he'll tell you know he'll talk about this that the fact that they like made him

482
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,760
drink a weird liquid and he'll forget certain things and so something kind of you know weird

483
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:44,040
going on there i don't know i don't know what it is a psyop wrapped in a mystery wrapped in another

484
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,440
psyop wrapped in some sort of strategic deception i love what annie jacobson says in her book about

485
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,720
when they're first flying the first jet planes out of out of uh air 51 he the cia pilots had to bring

486
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,760
gorilla masks in the cockpit oh remember that no because in case because the cia pilots when

487
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,280
they were flying those first jet planes in case they came in visual distance of a civilian airplane

488
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,640
yeah they had to put on the gorilla masks no way how crazy is that that's crazy that's my

489
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:15,080
favorite one oh that's so fast is that an area 51 that's an area 51 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you

490
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:20,600
spent a lot of time with jock fillet right you guys you guys are did you live you lived close to

491
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:27,000
him or no you used to live closer to la right yeah i lived in la for most of my life and um

492
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:32,200
no i just whenever we're in the same city i try to hit him up and visit him and um he's amazing

493
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,680
he's just a very very deep thinker yeah and they're clearly a lot of layers to his understanding of

494
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:43,480
the ufo a lot of layers the most interesting thing to me and i'm interested to hear your

495
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:49,560
thoughts on this was in diana's book she talks about him being obsessed with angels and demons

496
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:57,240
yes and this medieval spiritual stuff right oh yeah and she says that he gave her a book about

497
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,760
the devil uh-huh with 666 pages and he said to her if you want to understand this stuff

498
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:10,200
read the book about the devil what the hell i don't know what to make of that i don't think

499
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,520
diana did either when i asked her i'm like did you read the book she goes no can't find it

500
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:22,040
you lost it um no he didn't give it to her he just like showed her the book okay okay got it got it

501
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:30,280
yeah um i don't know man i mean i will say what you know you know the concept of lindy

502
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:37,080
so it's this idea that the current age of something should define its expected survival in

503
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:43,800
the future so really old things are very durable and are probably more true or right or like you

504
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:51,720
know yeah just valid um so like the bible very lindy play-doh very lindy you know modern

505
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:57,400
architecture or you know i don't know the museum of ice cream not lindy you know like right and so

506
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,360
okay um i would say that really applies to the ufo question whatever we are seeing now is probably

507
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,360
what we've historically seen forever and that's what jock valet's book passport to megonia touches

508
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:13,000
on it's like you know celtic medieval you know fairies and leprechauns and you know angels and

509
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,960
demons and you know passports and megonias it's based on the denizens of megonia and medieval

510
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:25,160
france it's probably what we're seeing today and they almost pattern match one to one in terms of

511
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,440
you know the actual story it's like somebody comes down there's missing time involved there's

512
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,520
sometimes implants and physical marks there's healings but people also freak out and sometimes

513
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:38,040
they get sick afterwards it's uh it's it's just very common and so i think

514
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,960
when you get into the religious stuff a modern scientist would say oh that's crazy or whatever

515
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,680
but if you treat that as a real phenomenology in the past if you treat you know like diana

516
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:53,400
posolka has in her book saint francis of assisi you know experience on mount laverne in 13th

517
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,760
century italy if you treat that as a historical artifact which i think you should then i think a

518
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,400
lot of these things were just ufos now where it gets weird is like then you say oh ufos are

519
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,160
just angels and demons like so many people say that and then you just you give them one more

520
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,720
question you say tucker carlson says that more oh he says it more than anybody and and you know

521
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,560
i'm a fan of tucker's but like then you ask any you ask tucker ask anybody then you say what's

522
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,480
an angel what's a demon they'll have no idea they'll be like i don't know what are you talking about

523
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,680
you know and so yeah there you go yeah yeah that's that's what i'll say by the way love that

524
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:30,040
fucking podcast you did with with alex jones oh thank you amazing one of your original ones

525
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:36,600
one of the og yeah yeah he he's hilarious man i love alex jones he's so funny dude that was

526
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:43,160

527
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:50,920

529
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:04,600
fun we shot guns and stuff but the vibe was like a little off and then my friend reva she was like

530
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,720
in la at the time and he was coming into la and she was like we gotta just make it gonzo weird

531

533
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:29,240
painting rocks with alex jones yeah getting drunk and painting rocks and he just said that's such an

534
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:34,760
og vice title yeah exactly it felt like very vice it felt like just i feel like your stuff is very

535
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:40,440
vice too like you have a lot of episodes like that but yeah he's just like oh man he's such he's so

536
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,920
fun to spend time he spent he looks so he looks like he said he would be such fun to hang out with

537
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:51,480
he's so fun he spent that whole day at my house and i gave him all these books and it was just

538
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:58,920
such a good fun vibe what were you guys drinking i think tequila tequila yeah yeah and he went he

539
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:04,760
was going oh he's he go yeah i know what he's saying right now he goes he this is so weird he

540
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,720
goes uh i didn't have a sexual desire for my for my mother but when i look at her

541
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:17,960
what oh my god when i look at her you know she's so beautiful and then i'll be like alex you are

542
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:25,400
crazy but dude he is he is such a smart dude he's actually extremely smart he's such a smart dude

543
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,280
yeah but like i like he the thing about alex jones that people a lot of people don't realize

544
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:35,800
is that he throws so many so much shit at the wall yeah there's the whole there's the there's the

545
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,600
meme right like alex jones always like he gets stuff right over time yeah he's like the difference

546
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,920
between conspiracy theory and the truth is six months you know alex jones was right again yeah

547
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,600
but like if you saw the volume of shit that he says yeah you would realize how much he actually

548
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:55,640
doesn't get right he does he does get a ton of shit right so much survivorship bias he's constantly

549
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,480
just throwing shit out there right of course he's going to predict something right yeah you know the

550
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,280
911 stuff is crazy how he predict like literally called out that al-qaeda was going to fly planes

551
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:10,520
in the tower on air it goes on osama specifically it's wild that is fucking it's why i think he's

552
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,360
like i think he's tapped in it goes back to our conversation on consciousness i feel like he's

553
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:22,680
like a a bit of a prophet he's like one of these people it's like a generically magnified receptor

554
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,320
and like i think he's like an antenna he's like an antenna and a lot of bad shit gloms onto him

555
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:33,960
he's like kanye too where it's like so much bad stuff gloms onto kanye and then so much good too

556
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:38,280
and like i think that's where people like don't understand somebody like him he's he can be so

557
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:44,200
wildly wrong when he's wrong yeah but when he's right it's like nobody else was right like it's

558
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:49,880
like a download that he got that was so prophetic it's so like out of his time it's really amazing

559
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,960
yeah and it's almost like you have to you have to be able to get rid of that filter

560
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,400
yeah for that stuff to happen because if you have that filter and you're like constantly like

561
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,160
sitting and mulling on things before you talk about them or before you claim them whatever it

562
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:08,360
is it's like automatically that is that is like you're not going to have that superpower but if

563
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,440
you don't have the filter built in at all yeah and you're just constantly just coming in and

564
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,920
it's going out it's flowing through you yeah then it's like you're more tapped in somehow and i

565
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,200
see yeah it's totally it's definitely you can see that with yeah it's like it's like automatic

566
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,880
writing where like you like you get the first like page you write is like contrives it's coming

567
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,320
from your like prefrontal cortex like this intellectual thing and then boom you get into

568
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,840
the flow and you're on autopilot and something's coming through you and the muse is you're tapping

569
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:38,360
in the muses yes and yeah i agree you can't have the filter and i think and that's why i get so

570
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,040
that's that's the double-edged sword that you have to be okay with you have to be okay with it and

571
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:48,520
you have to be discerning it's condescending to an audience to say i'm going to a priori conceal

572
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:53,320
you from this entire thing instead of i'm going to let you think for yourself and there's a lot

573
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:58,600
that this guy says is completely quacky and wrong and there's a lot that's super right and like but

574
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:03,720
we're not going to like you're not going to be like bubble boy and bubble girl who they you know

575
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:09,880
like like like like siphon you off from like this like you know really important you know possible

576
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,000
you know slivers of information that are really important yeah golden nuggets yeah totally

577
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:21,800
where where we're going before we start talking about how did we get to alice oh demons yeah i

578
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,120
said hillary hillary clinton yeah yeah yeah yeah oh you know you're talking about jock valet saying

579
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:32,520
jock valet i mean if you get into like there's like a gnostic three line in thinking about ufos so

580
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,960
like you're familiar with gnosticism yeah yes gnosticism yeah yeah i'm familiar with it so like

581
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:46,040
you know the idea that these are like arcani you know uh protectors or tricksters protectors

582
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:50,840
of the material world but that you know that there's like a you know there's like a demiurge

583
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,680
that you know runs the material world and that's like a lower god and then there's like a higher

584
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:59,400
god and this is not something i would fully subscribe to i think they're too anti i think

585
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,560
the material world's very special and we can learn all these amazing things from it i also

586
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,360
think there's higher stuff going on yeah so i'd say i'm more like i don't know like a neoplatonist

587
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:14,200
or something but there's definitely some gnostic thought and through lines in this world and like

588
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,920
i think that is one lens you can overlay the whole ufo question with but as to you know i don't know

589
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:25,080
yeah super into fallen angels and he's interested in demons and i don't i can't quite you know

590
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:29,960
explain that well the demon thing is interesting when you look at the virginia brazil case yeah

591
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,880
the thing that smelled like sulfur and they call it the three women they go it's like what's like

592
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:39,800
a demon you know it's yeah smelled like a demon had horns and eyes like a demon uh-huh and killed a

593
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:47,800
guy uh-huh uh-huh yeah no totally some of these things pattern or even the rumors of roswell

594
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:52,200
there's a cia liaison named chase brandon who wrote a book called cryptos conundrum

595
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,520
and the the alien being that comes out of roswell and i think there's some true stuff that

596
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:03,800
do you think we really have a being that came out of roswell i again i would say low probability

597
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:09,320
high probability that roswell happened something there was a crash there and then lower probability

598
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,280
that there was a being i don't know what i'd you know maybe lower probability that there's

599
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,800
50 ish percent but i at decently high there's a so many towns people at roswell like something

600
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:22,280
happened here beings came out edgar mitchell who i know this is going to kind of muddy the waters

601
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,280
because he was you know an apollo 14 astronaut who then got really interested in consciousness

602
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,360
and aliens you know this trip on the way back to the moon he almost this conversion experience

603
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:36,280
he was from roswell and it's like an open secret there that something happened um and then the

604
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,520
beings i would rank as lower probability than like the memory medal that jesse marcel this air force

605
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:46,760
flight surgeon i think definitely collected and i think it did make it to right right airfield the

606
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:54,040
tritium tritium what is the word for that metal the trit trit tritium or night tritium tritium

607
00:55:54,040 --> 00:56:00,920
no not tritium it was like uh it was like there was a crazy uh medal that there was a name a word

608
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:05,080
a name for it where it would bend and go back to its original shape oh you're talking about the

609
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:10,920
um titanium nickel alloy that so there's a contract between uh right airfield and

610
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:17,160
memorial institute right from 1949 that my buddy the gerb video uap gerb everybody check out his

611
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:22,360
channel shout out to gerb amazing researcher he's you should have him on he's awesome um

612
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:30,040
yeah so there's this titanium and i think it's a uh nick i don't know it's a crazy word it's an

613
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:36,680
yeah i don't know but it's it's titanium nickel alloy yes yeah tritium nickel alloy and that's

614
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,920
there's evidence that we that we have that we have that well we definitely have that that was

615
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:47,080
declassified as a material that we have in 1961 then you have to ask the question why does betel

616
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:51,160
memorial institute that runs all of our nuclear stuff have a contract with right airfield where

617
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:57,480
the roswell materials were yeah nitinol no no that's what it was that's the word yep so so that

618
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,760
they have a contract to study this stuff between right airfield and betel memorial institute in

619
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:09,880
1949 again there's the nuclear connection and then i think in 61 or 62 it comes out that

620
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:15,080
nitinol is a thing but why are you keeping it secret for 12 years and then nitinol is really

621
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:20,040
interesting because it exactly patterned so jesse marcel this air force flight surgeon he comes out

622
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:25,800
later in 1979 i think saying you know actually i was like forced to pose with this you know fake

623
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:31,000
material and you know and the project mogul comes out later the air force says that you know it was

624
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,720
just a weather balloon or whatever but actually it was this kind of you know memory metal that

625
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:41,960
was like extremely very uh durable and like you could you could apply a lot of stress to it and

626
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,120
it would kind of like uh it had like shape memory it would go it would go back into its original

627
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:51,880
form and look unperturbed and nitinol is that you can that's we know that that's the case yeah

628
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:56,040
that is crazy and james fox's witnesses literally said this is the exact same stuff they found in

629
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:02,040
brazil when that thing crashed there you go yeah so they said he explained it like he was like foil

630
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:06,360
that you could bend around and it would go back to its original yeah and robert sarbacher who was

631
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:10,600
very close with thomas townsend brown is probably working on a lot of this stuff talks about material

632
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:16,440
thinly layered materials that you know do similar things from that time yeah so i there's i think

633
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,440
they're there and then the bodies i'd you know rank a little lower probability but i've i've

634
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,720
heard from some pretty credible sources that you know i think there's something there too

635
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:29,960
so what do you make about what and moment of contact is and i think more by the way is

636
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:34,680
going to come out about the vargenia case moment of contact is in some ways better

637
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:41,320
what else is going to come out you guys special info jesse well my fellow men if you've lost your

james fox and i'm buddies with him and i just know he's kind of actively pursuing that okay so

654
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:05,320
yeah so i think i'm really excited to see what happens there but like i would rank that as

655
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:10,840
higher probability as far as the beings than roswell because we have witnesses who are alive

656
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,680
and we have them on video saying they were right there there's the three women who like how about

657
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,800
the scene where they go to the guy's house and he's like he pulls his gun out and he's about

658
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:22,760
to shoot him totally that scene and and then you know that there's this doctor that reportedly

659
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:27,080
died when the thing was in his hands and this kind of ammonia like smell which keeps coming up

660
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:32,520
so yeah he said that the the doctor who did the x-ray said the whole hospital spent like ammonia

661
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:38,680
for a week there yeah no no sulfur i'm sorry sulfur sulfur which is the smell of the devil so

662
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,920
yes weird yeah then you have to ask yourself the question like yeah how much of that stuff

663
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:48,280
is actually just historical and real like we if something has a religious veneer to it we throw

664
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:54,280
it out as not historical but we have to remember like pre-enlightenment everybody was religious

665
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:59,800
everybody yes so it's history it's not religious just because something has a religious overlay to

666
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:05,160
it doesn't mean it's inherently not true you can say a lot of the things in the bible feel beyond

667
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,800
the pale for you to believe or whatever like the seas parting in the old time whatever yeah but

668
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,640
to say that like somebody definitely didn't have this experience that seemed paranormal we put this

669
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:18,680
religious overlay over there i think is extremely close my sure yeah we have all these examples now

670
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,440
of people experiencing paranormal stuff and it's just not a religious overlay because that's not

671
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,800
the kind of mythology of today sciences right right yeah again like you say don't have it can't

672
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:32,520
throw the baby out with the bath water yeah but there's um when it comes to the crashes though

673
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,800
yeah what do you make of the crashes like if these things are so advanced if they're

674
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,240
extraterrestrials or if they're future humans that are 500 000 years in the future

675
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:46,680
why are they crashing yeah this gets into weird uh stuff but i think there's high-powered radar

676
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:53,480
that was developed in the 40s um i think uh watson watt was like the first guy that developed radar

677
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:59,000
that was in um in britain and then we started to experiment with more and more high-powered radar

678
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,360
and that we had that at white sands and i think we had that probably at right airfield and i think

679
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,800
we've had that at air force bases across the u.s and then i think they're attracted to nuclear

680
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:13,160
stuff and so i think they they can be disrupted by some of these high-powered radars and this is

681
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:17,000
where i it's the conversation kind of gets weird because i and they're not aware of our high-powered

682
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:25,640
radar i think that's possible man i mean there's also yeah i think it's possible like they could

683
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:32,600
not be care like okay if they're like directed any energy weapons is that like similar yeah and

684
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,160
it's weird i don't like talking about it because i think it's kind of

685
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:43,080
fucked up to be honest like i don't think that um should be you know yeah it's it's kind of weird

686
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:49,640
but yeah how so what do you mean well just just messing with these things at all i think they're

687
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:55,240
not kind of interfering with us and so we shouldn't interfere with them totally you know um but but

688
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:00,760
yeah i think as far as that being possible i don't think we know what they are i think we assuming

689
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,600
oh they traveled the cosmos to get here and they're so advanced or whatever and then they

690
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:09,400
they get messed up due to our you know like like how do we have the hubris to think that we could

691
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,720
like pop them out of the sky with this stuff it's like we don't know what they are and like why

692
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:17,240
they're here and there are ways in which you could be extremely advanced and then ways in which you

693
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:23,080
could be super simple like agi is way more advanced not agi any ai model is way more advanced on like

694
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:27,640
vector calculus than like a human way more advanced when it comes to like snap intuition and like

695
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:32,680
judgment of like kind of multimodal stuff like across different domains humans are way more

696
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:37,960
advanced than ai right so this idea that like they are stepwise better than us in like every

697
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:42,600
single way and can't crash i think is ridiculous and then it also is predicated on the space alien

698
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,920
thing that like again we don't know like they could just exist in this kind of interior fabric of

699
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:52,440
reality they could be kind of mostly ignoring us outside of certain things that light up in

700
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:58,200
our population around consciousness or nuclear you know things of that nature and so yeah the

701
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,920
development of certain you know weapons technology might interfere with them and i don't think that's

702
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:08,440
crazy to to say well it might not be as crazy if they were sending things that weren't biological

703
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:13,000
right if they were sending sort of drones through reconnaissance drones like kind of like we send

704
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,560
to other planets everybody i know is deep on this topic says that the biological stuff they're drones

705
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:23,640
and like the grays and all this they're like 3d printed things they're anatomically compiled

706
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:29,720
like like what is darpa looking into right now like like programming biology yes so like that's

707
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:33,880
probably what they are too and if you think talk look at like all the interactions with the alien

708
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,840
beings they're always like do not fear do not fear we won't hurt you this will take a second

709
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:42,440
and then they like you know this is like an incision and they like put an implant in you and

710
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:47,720
and then they go away and so like they are doing a low level task they're probably not the beings

711
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:53,720
themselves they're probably von neumann replicator envoys to like achieve a specific function so it's

712
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:57,560
not going to be that catastrophic if they lose something no not at all they lose something through

713
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:02,760
a lightning strike or a dew or whatever no it's like your little robot avatar but some people

714
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:07,080
think that they're crashing them on purpose right yeah we're like yeah it's like a donation or a

715
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:12,040
gift joc valet speculates that i don't i this is where i'm you know i have no idea yeah but um but

716
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:16,520
i do believe there are crashes there's just so many i mean lennard stringfield at 119 cases

717
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:21,000
there's a guy named ryan wood who has 104 cases most of which are uncorrelated with the lennard

718
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:27,640
stringfield cases so so when you're talking about those like anatomically uh 3d printed

719
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:32,360
biological beings that everyone thinks about is like the little gray aliens yeah when i had

720
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:36,120
greer in here last week he's as soon as i said that to ask him about those things he goes oh

721
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:40,760
that's just cia i'm like willy i'm like what about willy streber he's like oh that's all cia

722
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:46,200
that's all cia mind control stuff he like completely he completely brushed it off as like intelligence

723
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:54,600
black shit happening yeah he he his easy straw man for anything that he thinks is like fake in the

724
01:05:54,600 --> 01:06:00,360
ufo world is it's like intel national security deep state whatever and like i i just think that's

725
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:04,440
like super close-minded thinking and like i don't know i don't know it could be in the case of

726
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,920
whitley whitley did whitley has a really interesting story where um he was he did a

727
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:13,480
great podcast with him that everybody should check out but there were experiments done on him as a

728
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:17,880
child at randolph air force base near san antonio i believe did he tell you about when he went to

729
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:24,280
mexico yes yeah that was very strange as well yeah so i don't i don't know what to make of

730
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:31,320
yeah i don't know if you like have like a theory there but i mean and that's i think less of an

731
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:36,360
uncommon story than people realize as well these like gait programs these gifted and talent

732
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:41,720
talented student programs recruiting kids stranger things type shit stranger things yeah exactly

733
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:49,160
yeah whitley first of all when he came on that podcast i didn't know he had an implant and he

734
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,360
fucking dropped it on me right when we started recording by the way touch the implant or see

735
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,440
no i didn't touch it but he gave me he showed me a video you should have dude because that thing is

736
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,560
weird really he sent me a video of it there's a video of it i have and then he showed me like

737
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:07,880
the x-rays of it i saw you touch it though yeah that's crazy he says that he says that it moves

738
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:12,120
around yeah that's what he said he said they tried to take it out and it just moved like yeah which

739
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:17,000
also is a common thing that you hear of these things move on their own metabolism which is

740
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,480
that's that's very common with the implant thing so again it points to this kind of biological drone

741
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:27,320
thing have you read so have you read all whitley's books or just read i've just read communion so

742
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:31,720
there's a bunch of other stuff oh and i read his book on jesus actually oh did you really okay i

743
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:37,080
read that one too yeah um but there's a lot of there's a lot of interesting stuff that he

744
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:42,120
didn't include in communion that he does include in his other books this fella i had on the show

745
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:47,640
jason giorgiani is like i've seen that episode he is a historian of whitley streber he's read

746
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:52,360
every single book front to back multiple times and like i spent like two hours on the phone with

747
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:58,200
him before i had uh william here and there's a lot of other interesting things like wild wild

748
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:03,080
things that he left out of communion like for example there's one scene in one of his books i

749
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:08,280
can't remember the name of the book but where he talks about when the alien girl is like riding

750
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:15,880
him okay he says there's a cia guy in the room watching him a cia guy that he knows watching him

751
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:21,640
have sex with an alien watching him have sex with an alien no way and like like how do you explain

752
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:26,040
that what first of all why did you leave that out of the book yeah what was going i think i talked i

753
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:31,560
don't know i don't remember if i asked him about that in the podcast but like there's there's so

754
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:37,640
many just bizarre and then also like the history of him going to mexico yeah and like he didn't

755
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,880
want to talk about that to me on the show i don't know if he talked about it with you but like

756
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,480
apparently there were some kids who went down to mexico and he was a part of it

757
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:50,360
where he was at some house that was like guarded by the military and it was all military stuff

758
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:56,760
where they were like subjecting children to watching like like murder videos of people

759
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:02,120
getting like tortured and murdered to do something to their mind yeah to like to induce some sort of

760
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:09,160
trauma to these children right so if you combine that yeah with his stories yeah what i don't what

761
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:15,240
do you i don't know what to make of that well i i do think the inducing of trauma and dissociation

762
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:22,920
is more common than we realize when it comes to these programs that recruit kids and try to find

763
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:27,800
kids with high psi abilities and this is going to sound nuts to the average person who doesn't

764
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:32,280
believe that there's any sort of mind matter interaction or whatever but parapsychology has

765
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:37,400
been studied at elite universities since you know mid-century stanford research institute

766
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:47,720
princeton you know engineering and anomalous research pair lab duke the ryan center from 1931

767
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:54,280
1960 was the first one in the u.s and i think aerospace is known about this for a long time

768
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:59,640
and unfortunately i think we have a dark past checkered past when it comes to mk ultra which

769
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:07,560
came out in the church committee in 1975 and i think mk ultra and and a lot of the psychic stuff

770
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:13,320
dealt with trying to find kids and and and and and induce trauma and so i don't know

771
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:18,840
you know i find i find witley to be pretty pretty honest in his readout of things you know like it

772
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:23,320
not like a he's like a good guy and then like you know i don't know what to make of any of this stuff

773
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:27,480
i just listen to what people say and repeat it like me too sure yeah yeah well i think i think

774
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:33,240
um and then you can obviously remember things falsely as your you know kid so i don't know on

775
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:40,600
that but i i would be lying if i weren't to say that that didn't kind of pattern match to other

776
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:48,520
stories that you hear so whitley story yeah i just interviewed a psionic asset on my show oh jake

777
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:53,880
barber not jake barber oh but jake barber does say he says he kind of hints at this he goes

778
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,560
i was traumatized he had a really rough childhood his stepfather didn't

779
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:04,040
treat him super well and he kind of talks about how he was gifted as well where he was like you

780
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:09,800
know he had matched colors up as a kid with major chords and minor chords and so certain colors

781
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:14,280
would make you happy like a major chord certain colors would make you sad like a minor chord

782
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:23,000
and to me like my like almost uh coded read on that is like maybe you know he was part of something

783
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,840
as a kid or maybe they like they they they looked at him or yeah maybe maybe early on they thought

784
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:33,960
that he had something kind of special going on and that again it's a a lot of stuff around

785
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:39,720
gait programs in the u.s i think are going to come out in the next year programs gait g-a-t-e gifted

786
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:45,720
and talented education oh yeah i think a lot a lot of stuff there is going to get stranger things

787
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:51,960
style stuff i think stranger things as a show will look a lot more real than people now think it is

788
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:57,480
in a couple years from now yeah and there are people i know deeper than me on this who are the

789
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,720
tip of the spear as far as investigative research on this stuff so i'm not trying to blow up their

790
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:06,760
spot and uh yeah but it's kind of it's kind of weird it's kind of weird it's really weird that's

791
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:12,200
putting it like it's really it's really like uh it's it's messed up i was i'm just like

792
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:17,880
my pause with the shit with people like jake barber and um all the whistleblowers for that

793
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:26,200
matter is that if i am a part of this secret government right or the secret rogue private

794
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:33,880
organization that has possession and understands this super anti-gravity ufo technology contacting

795
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:38,600
non-human intelligence whatever it is it seems like something that's so much more powerful than

796
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:44,440
anything that the u.s government would even have or any government for that matter and if i wanted

797
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:52,680
to protect my secrets i would absolutely send out fake whistleblowers you know sure i think we

798
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:57,080
don't know exactly what to do with what we have i think we have bits and pieces okay if they take

799
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:02,680
this analogy if you had uh you gave a uh thumb drive to a caveman would they have any idea what

800
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:06,840
to do with it they don't know information theory they don't have a computer to plug it into just

801
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:11,960
look at this thing they probably like try to make a fire with it right right so like i think that's

802
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:16,520
you know maybe you can get some interesting derivative technology maybe the you know the

803
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:21,240
nickel alloy titanium maybe we've done some interesting stuff with that you know uh maybe

804
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:26,040
there are elements of the philip j corso day after roswell you know narrative that are true that some

805
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:30,760
of this stuff has made its way into civil side you know infrastructure yeah elements of it i think

806
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,760
there's clearly falsities in that book like i don't i don't think semiconductors required you know

807
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:40,440
alien tech to to you know their their patents of transistors that go back way back to the 30s

808
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:45,240
but by and large i think we're extremely confused and in the stone age on what we've retrieved

809
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:51,080
and so if you find this stuff and it's like cold war era we who do i mean it's the u.s government

810
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:56,600
the u.s the people who know what's going on yeah yeah yeah and and so like yeah i mean just like

811
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,800
america okay you know i don't know if you meant me or if you meant the guy that's working on the

812
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:05,880
craft well let me tell you i got a stash yeah yeah no i think i think like the the programs around

813
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,520
this stuff i don't i don't i don't think they know exactly what they're working with or what

814
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:19,560
they're doing and to me that explains a lot of like you like you you need in the era of cold war

815
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:25,480
secrecy um you know we're like we're like way ahead of like china and russia on like retrieving

816
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:30,440
this stuff to begin with then like you can keep it super over compartmentalized right and like

817
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:36,360
that's fine it doesn't matter then all of a sudden if like the cold war ends and then now

818
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:40,760
we're probably back in another cold war and it's this multipolar kind of scary thing and china

819
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:45,720
starts to catch up and like eat our lunch on some of this stuff then all of a sudden you need like

820
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:51,560
some civil side eyes like a lot of our best and brightest are not working at like lockheed or

821
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:57,960
northrop or like any of these places so you need to like let certain things out and so that i'm not

822
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:02,920
cynical about you know a lot of these whistleblowers i think they're they're genuinely

823
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:09,480
wanting to come out why they might have some sort of top cover or like why they're not dead to me

824
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:15,720
might be explained by you got to kind of let the cat out of the bag somewhat if that makes sense

825
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:20,040
because you need certain eyes on this thing because i don't think we've made a ton of progress

826
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:25,880
and on many dimensions you know i've heard rumors that we have alien reproduction vehicles or you

827
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:31,320
know advanced research vehicles that pattern match the UFOs we've made them flyable and then

828
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,560
i just i just don't know i don't know if that's like you know how much progress we've actually

829
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:40,040
made so and then even if we have made progress it's really that fundamental question of like

830
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:46,840
if we're at parity with china or russia then this stuff has to come out somewhat if that makes sense

831
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:52,360
and then we live in this like information age too it's just like impossible to keep a lid on

832
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:56,200
this shit and i do think there's there's these snowball effects where somebody displays a

833
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:00,760
tremendous amount of courage like david grush where he pieces together all this stuff and he

834
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:05,480
you know goes forward to the inspector the ic inspector general gives him a thousand pages and

835
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,800
you know offers to say i'll go to skiff with anybody and i'll you know show you where the

836
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,800
bodies are buried and i can give you the exact addresses of the you know facilities and stuff

837
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:18,200
it does this in front of congress and i think if you're on the program you're somebody like jake

838
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,800
and you're seeing that you're like this guy's really courageous and it like it inspires you

839
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,560
you know it's like the banister effect roger banister broke the four minute mile

840
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:30,680
and then 10 people broke the four minute mile like two years after him i think you see somebody go a

841
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:35,720
little you know you've had like moral qualms about what you've been doing already and you

842
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,880
see somebody like you know take it this far and you're like okay well i know a little bit more

843
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,960
and i could probably help with this effort i'm gonna go a little farther and so yeah yeah i

844
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:49,240
can see the problem though what you alluded to in that conversation with jake that if all of this

845
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:54,520
super high tech secretive war stuff that we're working on is so compartmentalized and

846
01:16:55,080 --> 01:17:01,880
not available to even people in the highest levels of the military and you know the highest

847
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:07,960
generals and the president like if we get into a war i'm sure that russia and china under their

848
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:11,800
dictatorships they're going to be able to get shit done instantly and they probably don't have

849
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:16,120
this problem of compartmentalization and keeping secrets from their actual government yes right so

850
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:20,440
like that's not that's a problem that's a huge problem from a national security standpoint i mean

851
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:25,720
read the three-body problem and like that's how it goes down it's like you see like a scientist

852
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:32,280
that you know you're the ccp or the you know the pla yeah and you see a scientist like working on

853
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:38,360
some really interesting neutrino info transfer you have something like really far out crazy stuff

854
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:42,920
that like you don't have yeah you just knock on their door you say we're relocating you yeah

855
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:47,000
you're working at this base that's it that's the way it goes that's not the way the us the us is

856
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,040
like you have these competing factions you have all this you know it's just it's it's way more

857
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:58,040
of this kind of uncoordinated octopus and so that's a good way put again so i think the reason you

858
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:02,200
know i think a lot of these nda's that people have signed in the aerospace context to work on this

859
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:07,640
stuff in the past are extremely threatening and they're you know really scary retributions that

860
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:14,280
could occur hypothetically for a lot of these people and then i do think whatever legacy programs

861
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:18,840
like don't want anything to come back come out are on their back heels and they're like

862
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:24,200
some limited disclosure has to occur and i think they're sort of they're they're kind of like we

863
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:30,360
don't quite know what to do here and i think my hope is there are people on the inside who are a

864
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:36,120
little more like we need basic ontological truths to come out it's like nuclear stuff right like you

865
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:41,080
have nuclear physics you have programs all over the country it's it's physics it's open source

866
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:45,560
ontological truths the ideas that there could be bodies and crafts like people need to know this

867
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:52,120
shit that's crazy yeah and then you know anything that um you know any trade secret that could

868
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:56,040
immediately be weaponized or as low barrier to entry you know blow up the world kind of stuff

869
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:00,040
that obviously should be classified yeah and we just need to think about it reasonably through

870
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:04,840
those lens but i do i do think there are people on the inside who are just dogmatically pro-secrecy

871
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:09,080
because it's like this like cargo cult bureaucracy thing it's just like they don't

872
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:14,200
they don't understand how to be any other way or something yeah i mean the the most frightening

873
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:23,240
thing is that if this rogue government that's like has its own air force military uh navy whatever

874
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:27,400
that has all this power and has this technology that could essentially like

875
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:33,960
beat any world government's technology as far as like war or whatever it is like and if they

876
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:38,760
go row and they start and if they decide to start a war against the rest of the world

877
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:45,320
like that's that's the worst that seems like the scariest thing regarding these companies

878
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:50,280
that have this stuff because what what's going to stop them from just keep from keeping more

879
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:58,840
secrets from you and just and just taking this technology and exponentially gaining more

880
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:04,600
information and and revealing more insight into it and understanding more about the universe

881
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:09,720
and keeping that shit from the us right turns into like a breakaway civilization a breakaway

882
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:13,960
military military breakaway it's not a country well i did it's like a company that's more

883
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:19,000
powerful than any country you know i did find it very interesting that like matthew livelsberger

884
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,920
the green beret he blows up a cyber truck in front of the trump tower so it's like this

885
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,600
weird message or something symbolic yeah felt kind of symbolic like some sort of meme warfare

886
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:36,760
thing and then the email he sends to sam shoemate who goes on sean ryan is all about chinese

887
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:43,080
gravitic propulsion drones which i think is china is not flying with impunity with you know

888
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:47,400
electrogravity propulsion like that's game over right like that's like we're in the cuban missile

889
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:52,920
crisis it's been going on for three months or whatever like that's not that but maybe it's

890
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:59,080
sort of a little bit of a shot across the bow bow depending on what was what force was behind

891
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:05,480
that because clearly he was dealing with a lot of trauma ptsd and you know i think was like a good

892
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:10,760
guy in his private life but like what leads somebody who's like that to do that and to send

893
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:18,280
that email and i did speak to a green beret about this and he was like maybe this is a way to let

894
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:23,400
out some of the gravity stuff that you know we have made breakthroughs with so think about it

895
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:27,720
like this like maybe you're sending a little shot across the bow again to elon to trump you know

896
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:33,000
civil side government and you're saying we've got some some hardcore shit that you don't have

897
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:40,040
and again this is deep conspiracy i would hold this very kind of loosely low probability but

898
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:44,520
it goes to the point that you know you've made and then yeah i don't know i don't know i don't

899
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:48,920
know where they are technologically and if they even have the power to sort of to sort of flex and

900
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:56,120
do that but i i i do think that aerospace has some pretty advanced technology that you know that

901
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:00,920
those drones over new jersey they didn't seem like anything special like they seem moving like

902
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:05,080
regular drones like they weren't moving at light speed or like they weren't moving like tic tacs

903
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:09,240
making sharp turns they were just like floating around like normal quadcopters they were floating

904
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:14,200
around for longer periods of time than you would ever expect like you know hours and hours at a

905
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:19,480
time they'd stay stationary so they were exhibiting some kind of exotic effects with the kind of winds

906
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:24,520
and stuff but like yeah generally and then i would make a huge distinction between a lot of people

907
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:29,800
were seeing orbs and like other weird stuff and then there were like the fixed wing drones that

908
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:34,520
looked like they were meeting faa regs which were obviously human and so i would make a clear

909
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:38,120
distinction between those two things i would also make a distinction between the stuff showing up

910
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:43,880
at nuclear bases which if you know robert hastings work yes that looks more i don't

911
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:48,840
want to say paranormal because that sounds quacky but that looks more like of the ufo the classic

912
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:53,880
ufo variety right to classify it probably is that the new jersey stuff didn't seem like anything

913
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:59,560
near the ufo variety no i i agree with that a lot of it and then you but you had salient nuclear

914
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:03,160
plant right there and you had stuff showing up there and a picatinny arsenal right you know

915
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,840
stuff was showing up right right right i think i think it was definitely our government or

916
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:11,000
one of our government contractors that was in charge of that i don't know what they were doing

917
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,800
but did you hear the audio of um you know right patterson's like comms links were down like their

918
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:21,320
power was out for like a few hours like that to me is classic robert hastings ufos and nukes

919
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:25,080
and that was happening around that time what happened with right patterson i thought they

920
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,880
just had to i thought they just had to like shut down the runway or something for

921
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:33,880
no that i think the power was out for for a couple of hours right patterson the power was out i

922
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:39,560
believe either the power cost all comms were down for a little bit yeah and there's an audio

923
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:43,000
this up can we find this we should look it up yeah let's find let's find out yeah i think it's on

924
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:52,280
twitter is where what would we search how do right right patterson uh communications outage

925
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:58,600
right patterson drone and there's an audio air force base experienced a closure of its airspace

926
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:03,320
for about four hours late friday night into early saturday morning due to sightings of small unmanned

927
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:09,560
aerial systems drones in the vicinity of the base the base's airspace was closed as a precautionary

928
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:14,520
measure to ensure the safety of the installation and its residents no property was damaged or

929
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:19,000
residents harmed during the incident so they closed the airspace okay and i guess there was

930
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,520
maybe there wasn't a comms outage it was like it was due it was precautionary because there

931
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:32,520
were stuff flying around it right right huh yeah i did hear i did hear uh i did hear like a um some

932
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:36,440
sort of radio comm thing too where they were talking about like shutting down the airspace or

933
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:42,040
i have a crazy one for you so in 2010 after robert hastings wrote his book which was 2008

934
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:48,360
yeah effie warren experienced an outage for what's that he warned effie warren is a nuclear base in

935
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:54,040
wyoming okay and it experienced an outage for they said 59 minutes but robert hastings did

936
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:59,560
back channeling and it was 24 hours and president obama was briefed on this now do effie warren

937
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:09,960
outage uh atlantic effie warren uh yeah outage atlantic and you'll see that this was reported on by

938
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:17,640
like mainstream media and i don't know if they go to broadband no the like the atlantic like the

939
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:23,400
you know the the periodical or whatever oh power and the atlantic magazine atlantic magazine oh

940
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:31,320
okay okay okay magazine atlantic magazine yeah is it a power outage uh just looks like a failure

941
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:39,640
shut that down yeah yeah exactly so i okay this is really crazy so president obama was briefed on

942
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:46,600
this and uh hastings backchanneled with this guy this retired missile technician named john mills

943
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:52,760
yeah and he uh backchanneled with some missile security officers on site and were like there was

944
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:57,400
a tic tac flying around all over the base and that caused the outage is this like one of the

945
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:02,760
minutemen missile silos like where they have those underground icbms i know malmstrom is i don't know

946
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:08,120
if effie warren is maybe but this is what's crazy is you can even see in the article at the top of

947
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:14,760
the article engineering so power is crossed out and then it goes into engineering failure

948
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,400
i think it's covering their ass i think they're they don't want it to seem like it was attributed

949
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:24,520
to a ufo or to a tic tac or whatever which again robert hastings back and by the way i should say i

950
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:28,520
think you know i was wrong about the right path thing so i don't want to like conflate like this

951
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:37,160
is another thing that i think is very uh uh legit um but i mean yeah that's huge when they shut down

952
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:42,440
a nuclear dude obama was briefed yeah right that's big that's a big deal no shit yeah and

953
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:46,760
and then you're backchanneling with these guys who say that it's attributed to a tic tac flying

954
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:50,840
around in the airspace right and then they're crossing out power and they're making it seem

955
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:56,520
like it's an engineering thing what does it say three other lccs were successfully restarted

956
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:06,760
the suspect lcc remains offline what is it lcc uh let's see here the lcc uh launch control center

957
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:14,840
oh okay so the lc the launch control centers they lost comms like they couldn't launch the

958
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:20,280
thing if they wanted to interrogate each missile in sequence so if they begin to send signals out

959
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:24,040
when they're not supposed to receivers on the missiles themselves on the missiles themselves

960
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:33,000
will notice this and send out error codes um it left 50 missiles in the dark the missiles then

961
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:40,280
restarted one of the lccs and began to normally wow dude dude that's freaky it's really freaky

962
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:46,120
and then you're doing you know hastings who i think is a very honest actor is doing backchanneling

963
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:50,120
with these guys and they're like there's a tic tac flying around and that's what caused the outage

964
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:55,560
and then i think one of them faces kind of career reprisals as a result of this back channel with

965
01:27:55,560 --> 01:28:00,680
hastings and stuff so and then you have that it's crossed power is crossed out and engineering is

966
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:07,320
it's like the live editing is shown on the atlantic article until i cover it up we're on um uh we're

967
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:11,400
on the brave browser the brave browser browser shows you all i wonder if it shows it in chrome

968
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:15,800
it does show it in chrome too it does because i put it in my documentary on hastings but okay

969
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:19,880
so anyway so so the right pat thing that is interesting that it i guess it sounds like

970
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:23,240
they were just incurred they were incursions on right and then they ended up shutting the

971
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:26,600
airspace down as a result that wasn't a coms link failure so that's my bad but i think they were

972
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:30,920
getting ready for the uh the eagles to win the super bowl so they had to like start figuring out

973
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:34,280
philadelphia they knew people were going to be looting and terrorizing the whole town

974
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:41,880
is going to turn into afghanistan for a week that's funny exactly but that just goes to the point

975
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:47,640
that like if these things are showing up around sensitive military sites yeah it points to the

976
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:53,160
nuclear connection it points this more generalizable three-body problem narrative where they're not

977
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:59,480
just showing up at nuclear sites they're showing up at advanced science research sites uh and the

978
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:03,560
most sensitive military sites and that was the case with the new jersey drone the whole new jersey

979
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:09,000
drone the the name new jersey drone is a psyop because they weren't just in new jersey they were

980
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,080
at lakenheath they were in florida they're in florida they're everywhere and they weren't just

981
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:18,120
drones the the drones were drones when this shit you could see that were taken down occasionally

982
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:23,800
blinking red and green because they're meeting faa regs obviously drones you know like clearly

983
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:29,560
those were drones in fact even the white house statement on the drones uh the press secretary

984
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:34,120
trump said well trump says it's very weird very strange it's not adversary and they're going to

985
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:37,880
the they're going they're coming from the garage and we know where the garage is so that that's

986
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:43,080
interesting right yeah the way he talks is just so confusing sometimes it's it's very confusing but

987
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:48,840
then his his white the press secretary tries to minimize it and say there's nothing to see here

988
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:55,080
she says oh it would they were faa approved they were research drones yeah see that begs a question

989
01:29:55,080 --> 01:30:00,040
if you were given orders by the president who told you we will clear this up immediately because

990
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:03,400
he was asked this as soon as he was elected he goes what happened there we have to figure that

991
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:07,720
out and he like orders somebody to figure it out yeah so those were your orders you're saying we

992
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:13,480
have faa research drones what were they researching if it's a prosaic easy thing to

993
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:18,360
explain away yes you say it how come no one has that if it's not if it is not then you don't say

994
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:24,360
it so i think it points to some more exotic answers again i don't know i don't know you have

995
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:29,880
to think probabilistically about all this stuff and i'd be open right to it not being ufos but

996
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:34,840
like yeah i think there's a lot of evidence also south port new brunswick duke energy plant there

997
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:43,400
was ufos showing up there too so like so so drones or ufos ufos meaning what what do they look like

998
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:49,800
they look more like these plasma orb style things yeah like the bledsoe orbs more like the bledsoe

999
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:54,680
orbs like those look very different than these like fixed wing like yeah they're just different

1000
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:59,000
okay that's why the whole thing is it's like not new jersey and it's not just drugs yeah it's a

1001
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,640
whole host of stuff and and it's again it but you get into these weird kind of questions of like

1002
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:09,640
were they trying to distract were they trying to run a simulation there's so many so many questions

1003
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:16,200
but also in the case in which it wasn't ours say it say in the case in which there were real ufos

1004
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:20,760
like not you know not ours not prosaically explained ufos yeah you would probably put

1005
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:25,400
some stuff out to research it you put some of our stuff out so it's like really murky and it's

1006
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:31,880
it's way more charismatic and easy and goes viral much quicker to be like there's a loose nuke on

1007
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:36,680
the eastern seaboard right that will go viral way faster than like it's actually a whole host of

1008
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:41,640
things it's kind of complicated it's not that interesting yeah yeah exactly so i think that's

1009
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:47,160
kind of what happened and that's why like the you know if there were psyops around explaining things

1010
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:51,800
away i think that's why it was so charismatic but then you talk to like the nuclear you know support

1011
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:56,600
teams that the emergency teams nest or whatever all of those guys were like no there's nothing

1012
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:02,920
there like you know nobody was like being evacuated right so clearly wasn't that so i it's weird

1013
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:09,400
dude with like all of this stuff that's been happening lately with the news cycle and all

1014
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:15,080
the crazy things that have gone on in the last six months like from trump almost getting killed on

1015
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:23,480
on live tv yeah to like a week later that story's completely dead and then we have like the olympics

1016
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:29,000
debacle and then we have like the the debates the election and all this the new jersey drones like

1017
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:36,040
there's like so much stuff happening on top of the fact that people are more awake now than ever

1018
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:41,160
of all the fuckery that's going on with like not only just the media trying to subvert stuff with

1019
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:45,960
advertisers but with the government trying to subvert stuff like people more aware of the word

1020
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:50,200
psyop now than ever i'm sure i'm sure we did a google trend on that word psyop it's probably

1021
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:58,600
skyrocketed last year for sure so like i wonder if the government came out tomorrow and said yes

1022
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:04,520
we made a deal with these alien civilization and they're here we have their ufos i wonder legitimately

1023
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:10,280
what percentage of people would believe that or just run the other way this is such an important

1024
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:16,920
thing you're bringing up because already already with the jake barber piece the ufo world has

1025
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:23,480
cleaved off and is on another island of reality from mainstream media has no idea who jake barber

1026
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:29,400
is unfortunate it sucks because it's such an important story but like because it's a hard

1027
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:35,640
pill to swallow we're talking about psionics mind matter connection yeah you know uh egg shaped

1028
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:41,400
things showing up in our ears like it's a lot to stomach all at once yes and it breaks the brain

1029
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:46,120
of these normie legacy people who like aren't down these rabbit holes that you and i are down

1030
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:50,760
because we've spoken to a lot of people and so it's this really important ontological question

1031
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:55,320
where it's like people we need disclosure we need disclosure i'm like if you walked into a

1032
01:33:55,320 --> 01:34:01,240
hanger and were shown a ufo you walked into the ufo it wouldn't change your life at all you'd have

1033
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:06,280
no idea what you were looking at and it would beget all sorts of other questions that you'd have

1034
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:13,400
that wouldn't be answered upon walking into the ufo or whatever so it's disclosure isn't some file

1035
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:17,400
that's going to come out where it's like this this this these are you know facts or whatever

1036
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:23,640
i do look i do think if trump or tulsi or like one of these people with like you know serious

1037
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:27,560
you know credentials in the government like cabinet level credentials or even from the past

1038
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:32,040
cabinet level credentials says there's a there there i do think that's like a step function

1039
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:37,480
up as far as disclosure like that's that's progress but it's going to be this it's you're

1040
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:43,800
dealing with people's core belief systems and it's going to be this sort of broken jagged

1041
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:49,880
process it's not going to be this like overnight like we have disclosure like people in our world

1042
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:55,320
are you know i don't know where you lie but in a lot of my world or whatever they're like we've

1043
01:34:55,320 --> 01:35:01,480
had disclosure like so much has come out outside of 8k you know imagery with like the president

1044
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:07,240
standing next to a ufo it's like we've kind of given a lot if they wanted to make it available

1045
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:13,960
if they wanted to do disclosure think about it they're doing it the right way right no one's

1046
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:18,520
losing their mind yeah yeah sure religion is not burning to the ground people aren't quitting their

1047
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:26,040
jobs and like sure shooting it's not turning into mad max out there like they they are doing it the

1048
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:32,840
right way although like kind of what i was alluding to is like with the distrust of media and

1049
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:37,880
government now and people being aware of the deception the strategic deception that they are

1050
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:44,360
capable of yep if the government was to say yes there's aliens we have them we have a we have a

1051
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:51,880
saucer right there would be a huge chunk of people who think automatically if they're saying that

1052
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:57,640
the opposite must be true yeah of course of course and i understand that skepticism and

1053
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:02,200
i have a reflexive allergic reaction to the government telling me anything

1054
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:07,640
as well and i would just say just because you think somebody has an ulterior motive

1055
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:12,920
because a lot of people in the ufo world have a fucking ulterior motive doesn't mean everything

1056
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:17,400
they're saying is wrong right maybe they're doing some weird controlled opposition thing maybe

1057
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:21,560
they're doing something where they want to make money and inherit some equities outside of the

1058
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:26,520
government maybe they're like they're i can give you 50 million reasons as to why somebody would

1059
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:32,280
say some shit about ufos and you know claim to come from an authoritative background that aren't

1060
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:38,840
pure that doesn't mean the facts they're saying are wrong and i think a you know a lot of these

1061
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:45,080
guys like i think that the the the prima facie stories of a lot of these guys are just fully

1062
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:50,680
right they're just correct and people just can't stomach them they can't they're like this just

1063
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:56,520
breaks their brain it breaks their priors and uh yeah it's tough and it's that's why you think

1064
01:36:56,520 --> 01:37:01,800
mainstream media hasn't reported on jake story yeah i think it breaks i think they don't know

1065
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:06,760
how to process it i think they have no idea how to get the the computer it like breaks their

1066
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:11,720
computer i mean dude those guys are mind controlled i mean like in those guys want money though they

1067
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:17,320
want that's true they do want money but they also you know have certain commercial interests and

1068
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:21,800
like are you know uh connected to like various i mean you're seeing what's happening with mike

1069
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:26,440
you know mike bens is reporting on all this like usaid like you know back channel shit with like

1070
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:31,240
every legacy media i'm so shocked that youtube's letting that shit go it's wild it's wild that

1071
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:35,240
they're letting it go but i think we've crossed the rubicon of sorts but like i hope so we don't

1072
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:42,280
know who's making calls at these studios but look at like covet like for a year i mean even in like

1073
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:49,240
i think 2022 the new york times published a steel manning of the like zoonotic origin of

1074
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:55,400
covet yeah it's like give it up guys it's so stupid like you literally have to it takes the

1075
01:37:55,400 --> 01:38:01,560
probabilistic thinking of a child to realize their wet markets all over china why was it the one wet

1076
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:09,560
market right six miles next to the wuhan institute of virology which is studying spike proteins added

1077
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:14,280
on to like a basically modification of sars and how they can create a pandemic like give me a

1078
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:19,480
break like there's an outbreak of chocolatey goodness in hershey pennsylvania john steward

1079
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:25,800
said it best hilarious and that just gets so simple right but they don't they're it they're

1080
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:30,360
overeducated they've lost their instinct they don't actually think about any media story critically

1081
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:35,240
at all they're i hate to say i come from this world i went to columbia and like i you know i

1082
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:38,760
know a lot of these people i love them they think i'm crazy now whatever yeah but they

1083
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:45,880
don't actually do thinking around like like they hear a story and they they're they ideas are fashion

1084
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:52,440
statements and they don't want to look bad at the water cooler you know at con day nest or whatever

1085
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:57,320
they are you know they don't want to like they and they're snarky and if you watch you know i

1086
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:01,240
used to end i interned for you know the daily show back in the day and like i i thought they were

1087
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:07,000
that's crazy i john stuart was a total uh bulwark against neoconservatism back in the day that was

1088
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:13,160
very healthy and like amazing and now he's just out they're out of touch man like like you have

1089
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:17,560
you know these correspondents go out these like mager rallies and they just like make fun of them

1090
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:23,400
and like they're snarky and look i was probably guilty of i was anti-trump in 2016 and like i

1091
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:27,080
think you know i thought he was kind of crazy and like i was the same way you know and i was like

1092
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:31,080
these these these states don't understand these red states don't understand what's good for them

1093
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:38,360
and then you my now belief is like the more like you go through like the liberal arts like

1094
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:45,080
ivy league education the more you lose touch with your real instincts about reality and your your

1095
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:49,640
worldview and like mental models on things are actually like really wrong you're like way off

1096
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:55,880
and it's couched in this veneer of sophistry and of sophistication and so it sounds really smart

1097
01:39:55,960 --> 01:40:03,240
but it's actually really stupid and it's wrong i try i try my hardest to be open-minded about

1098
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:09,640
things and look at things from multiple angles but like every single big topic like ufos or

1099
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:14,840
ancients graham hancock's a big one yeah yeah he's like he's like they hate him he's like no well no

1100
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:20,600
they fucking love him well it's either one or the other he's so polarizing it's so polarizing and

1101
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:27,960
the lack of open-mindedness and and and ability to form independent thoughts outside of the

1102
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:34,760
comment bubble yeah is astonishing yeah no it's it's crazy and it's it's it's an age-old trope

1103
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:41,240
in history of this amateur gentleman journeyer who has correct instincts is outside of the priestly

1104
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:46,440
citadel of experts and then gets proven right heinrich schleiman was this german businessman

1105
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:50,200
that was laughed at forever because he thought the ancient city of troy you know in the

1106
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:55,240
peloponnesian war written about by homer and thucydides was actually you know that wasn't

1107
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:59,080
mythology like that was actually a real place and then he goes out and he finds it in anatolia and

1108
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:05,320
in the 1870s and we have now tons of corroboration that's now consensus right louise walter alvarez

1109
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:10,200
thought that you know an asteroid impact took out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago and in their

1110
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:15,640
case they actually were extremely credentialed louise walter alvarez the father was uh you know

1111
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:19,320
in the manhattan project very involved with oppenheimer and so yeah but he was this like

1112
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:23,880
you know he was out of his domain right it was he was an archaeologist but he was right right

1113
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:27,240
and now now you have graham hankock and randall carlson they're saying the same thing about

1114
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:32,200
younger drag impact yeah younger dryus impact they're also pointing to mythology just like

1115
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:37,240
uh heinrich von schleiman did in the case of plato and dates around plato but they also have

1116
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:41,480
tons of archaeological evidence like great archaeological evidence that uh there was an

1117
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:45,720
air burst from the torrid meteor stream around that time and they're just not being taken

1118
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:52,040
seriously and my money's on them my money's not on the citadel so it's yeah it's just it's it's

1119
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:59,480
reflexive bad thinking and at any there's a great book by this guy sam arbisman it's called the

1120
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:08,200
half life of facts and at any point in history we were wrong about 50 percent of the like

1121
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:14,280
conventional wisdom at the time like or roughly right okay like so we're probably wrong about 50

1122
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:19,240
percent of what we know now yeah so if you are going around being this like michael schermer

1123
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:23,960
style or richard dockins kyle skeptic neil degrasse tyson like we know everything

1124
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:29,880
you're you you are being ahistorical you're engaging in bad thinking unless you can point to

1125
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:36,040
some percentage of current knowledge that you think is wrong you are a you're like a member

1126
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:41,240
an extension of the borg you're like you're the thought police for the conventional wisdom and

1127
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:47,880
you're probably wrong so yeah i just i like to systematically go through the anomalies

1128
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:52,840
because i think that there are tells on what the next scientific paradigms are like if you look at

1129
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:59,320
you know black body radiation uh was discovered by this german guy in the 1860s we couldn't that was

1130
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:03,560
you know the fact that that would create this ultraviolet catastrophe it was this guy gustav

1131
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:09,800
kerchop we couldn't understand that until max plank in the quantum revolution in the 1900s

1132
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:14,840
the mercury the the orbit of mercury wasn't understood in the newtonian context and we

1133
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:20,680
needed general relativity to explain it so when you see an anomaly like a ufo or like you know

1134
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:26,840
scabble you know washington scablands like you know impacts or whatever that you know you might

1135
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:32,200
represent you know the younger driest thing you have to systematically look at the anomalies you

1136
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:37,080
can't ignore them right because they lead to new science this is the scientific revolutions 101

1137
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:40,920
thomas kuhn wrote about this in the structure of scientific revolutions the anomalies bring

1138
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:46,920
in the new paradigm yeah so what i think you're doing and what i love to do is like talk to people

1139
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:50,920
on the fringes and just because you're talking to them doesn't mean you agree with everything

1140
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:54,760
they say you're not platforming them we have the benefit of talking to people on the fringes and

1141
01:43:54,760 --> 01:44:00,440
the people in the center of the academic institutions totally totally which they each one to you know

1142
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:03,560
some of them the people in the academic institutions are most are in a bubble they're

1143
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:07,640
not talking to people in the fringe every day yeah and same thing most the time with people on the

1144
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:11,880
fringes yeah and like the way i explained like the whole flint dibble graham hancock thing is like

1145
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:19,080
i completely understand how flint dibble who his dad named him flint because he's an archaeologist

1146
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:23,560
and his dad's probably an archaeologist yeah who spent his whole life studying archaeology reading

1147
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:29,960
the boring books doing the boring shit traveling all over yeah digging through the mud and pulling

1148
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:36,280
stuff out his whole life and nobody knows who the fuck you are yeah then graham hancock comes along

1149
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:41,960
writes some crazy fucking book and becomes a super celebrity and makes tons of money

1150
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:48,040
going on joe rogan all the time i'm gonna be i'm gonna be super jealous and resentful of that guy

1151
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:53,320
too hundred percent and i'm not gonna go as far as flint dibble did to make that very clear yeah

1152
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:57,400
some of the shit he did was really terrible in my opinion he was like lying about he was the some

1153
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:01,560
certain slides were up on that rogan episode that were just like wrong and not only that but like

1154
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:06,280
and this is a super unpopular opinion and i will get completely destroyed in the comments for saying

1155
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:13,800
this but i think flint killed him on that debate oh great hancock without having the ability of

1156
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:17,960
being able to monday morning quarterback and see okay he was wrong about a lot of stuff because

1157
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:22,280
he did do some dishonest things by like he was very confident in saying things that were quite

1158
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:26,680
literally wrong after people were able to go back and review the stuff and graham was actually

1159
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:31,160
able to go back over the podcast and find out like okay like you're completely wrong about the

1160
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:34,920
number of ships right or any of this other stuff that you were talking about but like right but

1161
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:39,720
like i learned a fuckload from flint during that podcast he was able to fill in the gaps of stuff

1162
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:43,400
that graham didn't really understand during that podcast i feel like and i feel like even rogan

1163
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:46,840
during that podcast was siding with flint sure on things like he was like graham don't you think

1164
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:51,400
that looks like that looks kind of natural to me yeah i was like no no no no no anyways that's

1165
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:57,320
neither here nor there i i think that like i thought he did a great job but what i don't

1166
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:00,680
like is how he went on twitter afterwards and like oh do you see how much i kicked graham's

1167
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:05,320
ass during that podcast some tweeting every tweet that graham did looking like a complete

1168
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:11,240
douchebag totally yeah but like so i guess my point is like i understand i understand how

1169
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:16,440
flint feels the why he feels the way he feels yeah right and why people in academia feel the way

1170
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:22,680
um the way flint feels and i see how there's sort of like a rift between these two groups

1171
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:28,840
and just like combine that with the way modern media works like podcasting is the number one

1172
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:33,400
form of information in the world now right and like people are more interested in the fringe

1173
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:40,760
stuff because it's exciting yep and it's more sensational and um i think you know long way of

1174
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:45,480
putting it but you know academia academics get resentful of that and it's created this sort of

1175
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:52,360
like this dichotomy if you will totally totally and and i but i think there's value in it to your

1176
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:57,560
point with flint double where it's like you need to stress test the really bold grand new ideas

1177
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:02,920
and theories and uh yeah i think science is a process it's like you know you have skepticism

1178
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:07,080
and dogmatism and it's a sillon karybdis and you want to you want you know you want both and i

1179
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:13,720
think having debates like that are really good but i'm always partial or sympathetic to quote

1180
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:18,120
unquote platforming the people with the bold grand ideas where like some of the stuff

1181
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:24,360
might be wrong semantically yeah but they're directionally correct on like in like a big way

1182
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:29,480
that's exciting versus these guys that are just defending the modern paradigm because i don't

1183
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:34,280
think that gets us anywhere like yeah like i agree like darwin is like a locally useful theory like

1184
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:38,200
i don't like i wouldn't i don't think like darwin's like fake right it's a theory and i think

1185
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:44,040
gravity's also a theory gravity's also a theory totally and but i think it's also useful in a

1186
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:48,200
scientific you know i don't i wouldn't like throw it out at all like these things are like extremely

1187
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:53,560
useful gravity is a great example because there are like many anomalies with it both on a macroscopic

1188
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:57,320
you know level with with dark matter and on a microscopic level you know with you know

1189
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:01,800
it's irreconcilable with the other you know forces on a quantum level

1190
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:07,640
and you know electrons don't exhibit gravity you know in the same in the same way you know other

1191
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:15,080
super wild objects do yeah it's interesting yeah yeah um so yeah i i don't know i think i i'm

1192
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:20,120
always partial to let's like systematically talk to the people with the bold theories and then

1193
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:29,480
stress test and come at them and try to you know uh uh uh negate any parts of their thinking that

1194
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:34,440
are kind of flimsy right but like you know really take seriously their their ideas especially when

1195
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:39,160
they're driven i think the difference between dibble and graham hankock is like one is driven

1196
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:45,160
more by intuition and this like life purpose mission thing and in our modern day that's seen

1197
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:52,120
as inherently bs or something whereas the other person's like like came up through the system

1198
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:57,080
yeah and like that's just seen as more valid and i would say if you're like you feel like hermetically

1199
01:48:57,080 --> 01:49:00,360
called to a thing you're going to be extremely motivated you're going to find out all sorts of

1200
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:05,080
stuff and he had i mean we would not be talking about gobekli teppi if it weren't for graham

1201
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:12,040
hankock and so we the conventional wisdom on like how old civilization is would be the you know

1202
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:17,240
classic mesopotamia was the cradle of civilization so like who's who's had more of an impact just

1203
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:22,200
based on that 100 it's graham hankock even flint said when he was in here he goes graham inspired

1204
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:26,440
a lot of people that i know that are now academic archaeologists and devoted their career to this

1205
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:32,520
stuff there you go so you know totally so yeah again and i don't even know like i don't even

1206
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:37,000
know what the actual objective was of that debate other than to like disprove graham's

1207
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:44,600
ancient civilization idea debates like this are tough yeah because like often it's like

1208
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:49,320
like i did like this informal debate with like michael shirmer i saw that and like who was the

1209
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:54,360
guy that he debated who michael shirmer you're michael shirmer and who no i i it was just me and

1210
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:59,480
oh no but i saw one on your channel with oh no no mick that was mick west and merrick von rennan

1211
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:04,520
camp and okay and that that was that was a tough one too where it's just you have the skeptics who

1212
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:09,640
i think do provide this service and i even came out thinking okay like mick actually you know has

1213
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:13,560
some interesting debunks in these certain areas i'm gonna like hold certain some of these videos in

1214
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:18,920
lower probability like actually one of my takeaways is like video evidence isn't the kind of archimedes

1215
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:22,520
lever for disclosure in general like it's not the thing you want to hinge your belief on at all

1216
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:27,880
because like they're all kind of murky and like not great although i think maybe on the margins

1217
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:35,160
merrick won the debate but yeah i think the the classic thing with like skeptic versus pro when

1218
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:40,360
it comes to these really kind of hard to answer questions is like the pro people have all these

1219
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:45,880
reasons as to like why you know it's anomalous and then the anti people they just they sit on these

1220
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:50,680
kind of like oh it's a law of large numbers where it's ockham's razor or it's that you know it's

1221
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:55,640
like these like rules of thumb that like are just it's like kind of lame and like provocative

1222
01:50:55,640 --> 01:51:02,200
and like you're not actually looking at the data like finally i think mick west has read

1223
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:07,880
ufos and nukes by robert hastings because it's such an important data set when it comes to ufos

1224
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:13,480
but he can't say anything there's nothing he can say because he gets like how are you going to go

1225
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:17,080
at these guys you can't go at their credentials you know say call them liars like they're on the

1226
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:22,760
prp program it's kind of hard so like you end up with these this like two trains passing in the

1227
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:27,480
night in the debates where it's like one side has a data set and the other side just won't agree

1228
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:32,440
that the data set is legitimate they're just like it's survivorship bias it's file drawer issues

1229
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:36,200
it's you're a liar you're a grifter or whatever but like look at the data look at them what do

1230
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:40,760
you mean like i've met a lot of these guys who've seen this stuff at nuclear sites and it's like

1231
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:44,840
some of them have maintained cue clearances for years after they've seen this stuff like

1232
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:48,360
and then at that point it's like i don't know what to tell you if you're not going to like believe

1233
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:51,560
you know if you're not going to like read the book which is a 580 page book

1234
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:59,720
extremely dry and it's almost boring really because it's so rigorous and good and meticulously done

1235
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:04,680
like robert hastings has like an eidetic memory and so like you're either going to read the book

1236
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:07,800
and like engage with it or you're not and if you're not then like i don't know what the

1237
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:13,400
debate is about right what do you make of elon not being impressed or not being interested in

1238
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:18,520
this stuff i find it really interesting um you know starlink is just like an optical

1239
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:25,480
group of you know satellites and it's it's the biggest you know optical you know group but and

1240
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:29,160
then obviously the rf communication have you seen like the videos of all the satellites that we have

1241
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:33,320
surrounding the earth it's insane yeah it's crazy especially starlink is just blowing it out of the

1242
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:37,240
water i mean it's it's everywhere and they have they have um i think it's star shield is like

1243
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:42,520
the dual use kind of you know optical or whatever but so you hear that these things the ufos are

1244
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:47,960
like picked up by like other sensor modalities i don't know on elon i like look in the world in

1245
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:55,080
which ufos exist i would have to think he's got to know some stuff you know like i just so i don't

1246
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:59,480
know if he's playing especially these rocket guys like tim are fucking dedicating their like their

1247
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:04,280
lives to this stuff totally and they have any overlap okay the interesting thing i thought on

1248
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:08,440
elon is he kind of toothed he walked back a couple of things recently in the last couple of months

1249
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:12,600
somebody said mentioned david gresh to him and said like you know maybe we're hiding all the

1250
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:17,080
secret tech and he said well if we are hiding secret tech i would hope that that would you know

1251
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:21,960
come out and so that was a change in tune that wasn't this like you know joke oh i'm an alien

1252
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:26,280
or like i would know like it's you know we don't have high resolution imagery like he kind of walked

1253
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:31,880
that back in that in that you know interview question yeah and then the second thing he said

1254
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:37,080
i think tucker asked him about ufos and he said i think it's deep black american programs really

1255
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:41,400
at that point you're kind of backing yourself into a corner where it's really interesting like

1256
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:44,520
what are you saying man are you saying that we have deep black american programs that

1257
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:51,480
look like they're breaking physics so like they break conservation momentum they fly mock you know

1258
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:56,120
10 and then they stop on a dime yeah and then they you know make right angle turns yeah and then they

1259
01:53:56,120 --> 01:54:01,480
go from you know right above the water to like above 80 000 feet like david fravor is saying

1260
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:06,360
and you know uh looks like they're you know not using chemical combustion because if you are then

1261
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:12,920
you're saying we have physics that's in deep black compartments that you know well surpass what we're

1262
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:16,760
doing with chemical combustion when it comes to starlink where you have these you know i don't

1263
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:22,680
know 33 36 raptor engines and it's all just mass ejection and it's all just you know newton's laws

1264
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:26,920
yeah and so it's you're kind of backing yourself into a corner where it's like we either have

1265
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:31,720
secret physics or you're because you're saying this stuff is real in that interview you're saying

1266
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:37,560
the stuff is real or maybe there's you could hang on like um that we have some you know really

1267
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:41,960
good like radar spoofing you know and like that would be your you know or flier spoofing or

1268
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:46,440
whatever you'd have you know yeah some some version of that maybe you could do holograms and optical

1269
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:50,200
spoof i don't i don't know what he would say but it's weird it's such a mind fuck because i think

1270
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:53,640
if i can think of anyone who'd be more interested who should be interested in stuff i would think of

1271
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:58,200
him i know i'm with you it's a it's a strange it feels like you know just like there's like

1272
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:03,480
dark matter in physics it's like what's the dark matter there like we can't detect something

1273
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:08,760
going on there and i don't i don't know what it is that's so true man that's so true um i gotta

1274
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:14,520
get leaked go take a quick break yeah let's do it yeah cool all right we're back from our pp break

1275
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:22,040
yes um yeah the elon stuff is crazy so i wanted i did want to ask you um yeah how did you find

1276
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:23,960
this guy jake barber and

1277
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:31,640
i don't even know where to start with this guy can you explain how you met him and then how

1278
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:39,480
like what happened with him and where he came from like his story yeah so he was originally

1279
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:43,240
like a red team guy who was well he was on the program what does that mean

1280
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:51,480
around that means he was like meant to infiltrate like like adversary groups

1281
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:56,600
okay and stuff and so like he and he was like you know it's basically like security for the

1282
01:55:56,600 --> 01:56:01,400
program so he was part of the crash retrieval program he was pipelined through air force combat

1283
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:07,640
control which is a special uh the air force version of special forces he didn't become air force

1284
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:12,360
special forces at that point he became kind of sheep dipped if you know that term and like

1285
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:18,040
intel circles or whatever like erased like he became like you know director of operations

1286
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:23,640
for a helicopter company and you know he that was basically his title okay but he was working

1287
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:28,520
with these you know prime contractors you might be able to guess who they are he doesn't reveal

1288
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:34,040
who they are exactly but he is he so he says he was working with the secret aerospace contractors

1289
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:38,280
aerospace contractors and i would imagine he's talking about companies that are are like or

1290
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:43,320
similar to battelle or any of these other ones like lockheed or something like that yeah i don't

1291
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:48,040
know you could guess he didn't he didn't he said he said if you tried to guess too you'd probably

1292
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:53,640
get them right on your first try so i might have got those two right maybe maybe um and so he's

1293
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:59,800
doing retrieval operations for them and then on behalf of his employer he goes to red team

1294
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:04,520
stephen greer the stephen greer was the we were just talking about this he was like the go-to guy

1295
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:09,400
for like any whistleblower in the government like he was the guy the disclosure project was

1296
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:14,280
for the last 20 years he was trying to subvert stephen greer's whistleblowers and in 2023

1297
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:22,040
stephen greer held his like disclosure you know congress thing or whatever and he had done a

1298
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:28,280
version of this two decades prior in 2001 i think and it was with a lot of really impressive amazing

1299
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:33,480
whistleblowers and it unfortunately it's kind of couched under the veneer of stephen greer who

1300
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:38,280
has you know certain issues yeah personnel everybody i mean every single respectable

1301
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:45,800
person in the ufo world um they all detest stephen greer he can i don't know why yeah i mean i can

1302
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:50,520
i mean i can i can i can imagine why yeah i don't know if there's like any kind of like like solid

1303
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:54,280
reason why they don't like him i don't know the guy personally and i've been trying to interview

1304
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:58,600
him for like a year through various go betweens and it's i've gotten a lot of like weird respect

1305
01:57:58,600 --> 01:58:03,480
like ego and responses i don't know i don't know what the deal is yeah so for anybody watching like

1306
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:07,960
i'll put you in touch with them oh thanks man appreciate it oh that'd be awesome yeah um i'll

1307
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:20,760
trade you for a grush that's not a fair trade bro i need somebody else that's so funny um so like

1308
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:25,560
we're trading them these ufo people like pokemon cards yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly gotta

1309
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:29,880
write you it's yeah greer's like in the pokemon what would he be is he like uh

1310
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:36,120
don't say it i don't know i'm not i know like there's collectibles you gotta catch them all

1311
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:40,680
but like what which one would greer be would he be the charizard or what maybe it might be charizard

1312
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:46,280
i don't know okay what's the big one that would puff out all that stinky gas what's the most what's

1313
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:53,000
the most valuable pokemon charizard right no it's mew it's mew no mew too no mew is even more

1314
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:58,760
valuable than mew too mew too and then mew is like the baby mew too i think oh okay i don't know

1315
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:03,160
yeah you gotta if you're gonna if you're collecting these guys you gotta have you gotta

1316
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:08,280
have greer on your belt yeah i know like you explained that to me right he's one of the most

1317
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:14,120
legendary like like og ufo people totally you said he was like in the 90s he was the only guy he was

1318
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:20,040
like the only guy but i mean that's not that's actually an important thing to correct he was

1319
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:25,960
the only very public facing guy and that's why he became who he is now but i think he took a lot of

1320
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:29,960
his stuff from a guy named uh bill hamilton william hamilton who would write about these deep

1321
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:35,720
underground military bases covert operations and there was a lot of actually hard-headed research

1322
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:39,800
going on at the time and he kind of shored it up and made it this more public then it was interesting

1323
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:43,000
it's an interesting origin story because i don't quite understand how he went from he was a

1324
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:48,040
physician and he just says he was an er doctor he was an er doctor and then he got super into ufos

1325
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:54,280
he said during one of his ce5 things um there was a an air force spook or something there and saw

1326
01:59:54,280 --> 02:00:00,120
the stuff he was doing and told the cia guy the head of the cia who then wanted to go to dinner

1327
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:07,080
with him yeah it's super interesting i mean and again i believe the jake barber account and like

1328
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:12,600
it kind of comports with that where it involves like trying to call stuff in which is so at that

1329
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:17,640
time you have this guy albert stubblebine who also has connections with remote viewing at the time

1330
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:24,360
and john alexander who's this long-time kind of ufo historian but he also debunks certain things

1331
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:30,200
and he clearly has deep government ties also close to with blood so and inserts himself in like all

1332
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:35,240
sorts of interesting like john hutchinson was this guy who would claim to like have mind matter

1333
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:40,920
effects with like these like metallic instruments around him in california and john alexander shows

1334
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:45,960
up there john alexander is this very interesting figure in ufo world where he just pops in like

1335
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:53,160
you know at very opportune times so stubblebine career claims he offered him two billion dollars

1336
02:00:53,160 --> 02:00:59,320
to participate in the legacy ufo or oh i thought the side i thought it was like joint come join our

1337
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:04,600
ufo program or something it was okay he explained it to me like it was part of the offered him two

1338
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:10,440
billion dollars to basically be a part of their building the public narrative or something okay

1339
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:16,840
interesting interesting well that yeah it sounds like yes sounds like i mean i like i actually i

1340
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:22,360
think there's an email showing that maybe but but i i don't think the offer was real i think i mean

1341
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:28,200
stubblebine's this weird character he's army counter intel and he's also on record touting all

1342
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:31,800
sorts of other bizarre conspiracies and he's one of these people you just don't mind it

1343
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:35,320
stubblebine is yeah yeah and so it's one of these people you just don't know what to make of him

1344
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:40,440
but they do insert themselves in greer's life and then greer becomes the de facto guy where

1345
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:45,880
if you're on the inside and you're working at lock eed or north rip or you know you're a cia

1346
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:49,960
contractor or whatever you see some shit and you want the public to know you go to greer and so

1347
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:57,640
the disclosure disclosure project archives are to this day probably like among the best ufo

1348
02:01:57,640 --> 02:02:03,400
databases treasure troves of pretty interesting contemporary information and so i you can't throw

1349
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:09,960
baby out with the bathwater as much as he's a very interesting kind of strange character yeah

1350
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:14,520
there's some ego there he's easy to dismiss for sure yeah and there's definitely some messianic

1351
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:19,720
but like it feels like he's you know so he's the guy who's bringing the dance like come on dude it's

1352
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:24,440
everybody you know yeah it is most people yeah and this you know it's just like there's also like a

1353
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:29,560
thing when somebody has you know has all the answers to everything yep yep you know there's

1354
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:34,520
a weird thing that happens there too yep yeah but um what we're talking oh we're talking about

1355
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:40,200
jake barber so so greer um greer was hosting this thing uh where he had all these whistleblowers he

1356
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:44,840
was providing an outlet for these whistleblowers to come out and um you were saying that jake

1357
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:52,040
barber went there to try to red team red team meaning what infiltrate greer and trying to like

1358
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:58,360
like like bust one of these guys for blowing the whistle but bust the whole organization maybe

1359
02:02:58,360 --> 02:03:03,480
infiltrate the organization and then become you know like the guy from legacy who's feeding info

1360
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:09,320
back into legacy ufo programs from like you know this important kind of vulnerability threat

1361
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:15,480
vector or whatever yeah and so he's at this congress or whatever and you know his story is

1362
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:20,680
that michael Herrera do you know who that is yeah he's a marine who was in the philippines and

1363
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:26,760
he gets diverted with his unit of i think like eight or nine people to indonesia and indonesia

1364
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:30,840
is a disaster zone it's due to this earthquake there's a tsunami warning and so everybody's

1365
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:37,000
evacuating the area and he's marines he and his marines are apprehended first he sees an eight

1366
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:44,920
gone like an octagon shaped craft hovering above the treetops that he says is vanta black and it's

1367
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:50,440
like he calls it blacker than black and it's above the treetops and he starts to close in on that

1368
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:55,160
craft with his marines because they're like what the hell is going on here and then they get

1369
02:03:55,160 --> 02:04:00,360
apprehended by this elite paramilitary unit which in like i think it was 2009 like they had like

1370
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:05,240
bioscanners and like all sorts of gear you would never expect that they like they were clearly and

1371
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:10,600
they were very well trained probably tier one special forces and we're kind of running circles

1372
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:15,080
around these marines saying stuff like it's easy to get lost in the woods or it's easy to get lost

1373
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:20,600
in the jungle you know like well you know uh did these guys say they were part of any any specific

1374
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:25,160
branch of the military or were they did they have any like badging on them they had it was

1375
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:32,760
completely nondescript but very advanced according to Herrera and so private prop yeah maybe yeah and

1376
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:40,840
they were loading these crates onto this flatbed this truck it was like an forward f-250 or something

1377
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:48,200
and uh he was like i don't know what the crates were whatever and so barber he's at this disclosure

1378
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:52,280
event where Herrera is giving this account and Herrera also gets interviewed by Shawn Ryan as

1379
02:04:52,280 --> 02:05:01,400
well and barber is like i could see the authenticity in Herrera and i you know what am i doing here sort

1380
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:06,840
of thing and there are other reasons i guess barber felt like he was betrayed by his you know

1381
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:13,480
contractor uh in the past and at that moment he goes like fuck this i'm gonna like red team the

1382
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:17,480
red team or i'm gonna like red team you know the the i'm gonna i'm gonna talk to these guys

1383
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:22,680
earnestly yeah i'm gonna side up with you know the Herrera's of the world and try to see if we can get

1384
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:30,680
you know some of these truths out um and so he back he talks to Herrera and he says that the crates

1385
02:05:30,680 --> 02:05:36,600
actually had people in them in indonesia and that these crates were bringing back these psionic

1386
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:44,520
assets that are used for the ufo program to attract ufos and so it's this crazy story

1387
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:48,920
psionic assets meaning like 11 from stranger things they're trying to find girls like they're

1388
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:54,120
like young children i don't know i don't had superpowers i don't know what age again there

1389
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:59,160
are stories that like really match stranger things as far as the ages of the people being

1390
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:04,680
recruited into the programs and that gets into some weird weird shit um and so i don't know what

1391
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:09,880
age these people were because they were in these like metallic containers and they were being

1392
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:13,800
evacuated from the area i mean even the fact that they're being kept in the metallic containers is

1393
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:20,280
weird right like rear also said there was uh they were trying to get homosexual people that's

1394
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:28,360
apparently this thing apparently uh uh gay men and uh left people were left-handed yeah and again

1395
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:33,080
this is something i just i have no idea if that's right how true that is but that's i'm just trying

1396
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:37,560
i'm trying to like think through the logistics of that you're in an earthquake zone where there

1397
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:42,600
was a crazy natural disaster people are like they're i don't know if they speak english right or

1398
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:47,320
they have the other guys speaking indonesian right but like were they like raise your hand if you're

1399
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:52,040
a homosexual or like are you left-handed or right-handed like how are you doing this are you just

1400
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:56,440
bulk gathering these people and then figuring it out later i don't know and it's it's there's

1401
02:06:56,440 --> 02:07:00,520
another question is like were they engaging in operations and did they have to evacuate because

1402
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:05,640
of the tsunami or where they take and this is the way Herrera presented on Sean Ryan which is

1403
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:09,800
more nefarious honestly where it's like are you taking advantage of the fact that there's a

1404
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:15,560
disaster zone and people could go missing yeah and taking them back with you which is like weird

1405
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:20,680
of course they would be why wouldn't they be well it's a question of like were those people

1406
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:25,640
already like willfully signed up for the program they were attracting stuff in the jungle of

1407
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:29,320
indonesia that's why the the the black craft was there i guess the black craft

1408
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:34,200
i think was human so so i take that back but like maybe that was part of the operation but like

1409
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:40,760
so yeah they were like engaging in operate field operations there or was where you just the

1410
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:45,320
operation itself was to round up these people who were lost that's the impression that i got was

1411
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:49,400
that i mean just from watching your podcast the impression i got was that they saw there was a

1412
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:53,720
disaster there and thought this would be an opportunity to right extract some people we

1413
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:59,000
want to talk to Herrera and i want to get to the bottom of it he says that on the Sean Ryan

1414
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:03,720
podcast yeah but barber says on my podcast or they were engaging in operations and they had

1415
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:08,680
to get the hell out of dodge because this tsunami was coming so barber also seemed very off put

1416
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:15,320
about Sean Ryan and Herrera saying that that they were just going there to exploit the the disaster

1417
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:19,000
and get those people out he seemed kind of like right he's like i didn't like the Sean Ryan even

1418
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:24,360
used the word human trafficking right right he was like defended by it almost right right yeah so

1419
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:29,880
yeah i don't know i don't know the the kind of ground truth on that but so so he's saying that

1420
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:35,720
their people that these people are being taken from this place in indonesia and my assessment

1421
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:42,920
my guess is that like these people are are more in tune to nature they're not around technology

1422
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:47,960
and civilization so jake said that they he said that on your podcast maybe they have a different

1423
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:53,640
diet they're not eating processed garbage so that would automatically give them let them be tapped

1424
02:08:53,640 --> 02:08:59,560
into this muse or this consciousness or whatever well that's what they say in the u.s too like

1425
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:06,120
you know you have dolce you know new mexico you have tacoma washington you have skinwalker ranch

1426
02:09:06,120 --> 02:09:10,600
all of these are ancient native american lands and apparently that's where a lot of this kind

1427
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:16,360
of weird stuff shows up skinwalker ranch we know was professionally you know as part of ufo research

1428
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:24,680
efforts investigated as part of osap from 2007 to 2012 and so i i think both like the people

1429
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:30,920
are like it's it's it's just like you know if you go to like you know most indigenous tribes you

1430
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:34,360
talk about people from the stars you're not going to freak them out like they're going to be kind

1431
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:39,720
of familiar with those concepts like yeah we come down during our ceremonies you know it's both i

1432
02:09:39,720 --> 02:09:44,200
think that for the people it's like they have less of like an allergic reaction because they haven't

1433
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:48,600
been indoctrinated with this materialist reductionist western paradigm where we even need

1434
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:53,240
the idea of disclosure like for them it's like second nature or whatever yes exactly and um

1435
02:09:53,240 --> 02:09:58,440
and then also the land itself which then you're getting into like trippier territory as to is

1436
02:09:58,440 --> 02:10:04,040
there a residue on the places themselves that where like more kind of strange stuff goes on

1437
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:08,200
like i i would say yes like i think a lot of the stuff that goes on at skinwalker ranch is

1438
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:14,920
genuinely not you know we need to explain it via science but it's weird it's definitely weird like

1439
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:20,200
i don't think that that show you know the secrets of skinwalker ranch yeah it might be like you know

1440
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:24,840
you know the the the noise effects probably do it at disservice and you've got that kind of

1441
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:29,800
history channel thing but like yeah it's produced it's produced but like i i don't think they're

1442
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:34,520
lying about a lot of that stuff and if you again if you just investigate the you know first principles

1443
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:40,120
like what's happening there it's pretty weird it's pretty weird it is so the cattle mutilation

1444
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:46,600
thing though that they talk about on mirage men yeah is fascinating yeah what's your take there

1445
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:53,240
oh i mean it just seems like a perfect distraction or just a psyop right i mean but it was all well

1446
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:58,360
they it seemed like an unintended psyop that worked perfect for them right because i guess there was

1447
02:10:58,360 --> 02:11:02,840
some sort of they were trying to prospect for oil i think it was there was a company that was trying

1448
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:09,960
to find oil by detonating an underground nuclear bomb uh-huh and they were trying to test the local

1449
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:17,480
agriculture and wildlife to see how far the contamination went in the soil yep so they

1450
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:22,360
were trying to find like they were extracting the glands of these cows to see if they had been

1451
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:29,000
affected by this radiation or whatever see if there was contamination and that happened to be

1452
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:32,920
the same place that they were flying this crazy exotic stuff yeah and so the people were like oh

1453
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:37,800
my god we're seeing ufos and these cows are looking like this like it must be it must be them doing

1454
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:41,960
this so it's like now okay that's the perfect place to keep doing these test flights yeah yeah

1455
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:48,360
yeah sure sure yeah yeah that was super interesting to learn about that and to see how like you know

1456
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:55,320
just just like two operations collide and end up being the perfect fucking mind fuck for the public

1457
02:11:55,320 --> 02:12:00,440
to like 100 make sure people don't know what's going on 100 100 no and that movie's super

1458
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:06,200
important to realize how sophisticated a lot of the psyops can be and and and it's like you can

1459
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:11,320
you know write scripts and backgrounds and like make everything kind of weave together and fit but

1460
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:18,680
like the the a could you know be a data point b could be a data point that could be look completely

1461
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:23,480
uncorrelated but like you're the source of both or whatever you know and like that's definitely

1462
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:28,440
a thing you have to look out for in this world for sure so going back to barbara he was saying

1463
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:32,840
that there was a secret place where they were trying to use these people that they captured

1464
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:42,680
and give them drugs and get them to yep summon these ufos yeah stress inoculation and dissociation

1465
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:49,240
and yeah it's like weird yeah and i think people who've had trauma in their past i guess are

1466
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:55,160
predisposed of all of this is seems a little great i was saying it was dopaminergic drugs

1467
02:12:55,160 --> 02:13:01,400
that they were giving them yeah that might make sense yeah yeah i mean i again this is not based

1468
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:07,000
on firsthand knowledge so i don't i don't know you know this is all like super super speculative

1469
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:16,120
but i also like so i'm in the camp where i believe the summoning stuff is very real and very dangerous

1470
02:13:16,120 --> 02:13:22,280
and the i i feel pretty like you know like i think jake barbara's story is like pretty

1471
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:27,160
beyond reproach actually on the like surface level details of it and then what do you mean by that

1472
02:13:27,160 --> 02:13:31,240
what do you mean it's beyond like you think it's super legit i think it's super legit yeah i do

1473
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:40,520
where i get worried about what might be an after effect is this idea of like summoning

1474
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:45,160
things into your purview i think that stuff's really real and i think it's dangerous i don't

1475
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:50,360
think it's for the you know i think you have to have very pure intentions and i think if you show

1476
02:13:50,360 --> 02:13:55,560
up in certain places and you try to you know do these things i think that's it's very it's very

1477
02:13:55,560 --> 02:14:01,480
it could end very badly for for people so and i think it's the reason you have all this stuff

1478
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:05,880
at skinwalker ranch where like often it's guys with big egos or whatever it's like they have

1479
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:11,480
the story of this like hell's angels chieftain who like you know goes there and he's like put

1480
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:15,240
into a catatonic state like on the mesa or whatever and then he has to go he's in the

1481
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:21,080
hospital for three weeks after that and uh so i think it's i think it's kind of dangerous to

1482
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:26,760
do some of this stuff if you're not doing it safely and and and honestly with it just pure intentions

1483
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:34,840
what's the danger i don't you know have you uh you've had dana pesolka on right yeah okay so like

1484
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:41,640
you remember the story with saint francis of assisi no so okay so he's this you know um he's

1485
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:46,840
actually kind of grows up like kind of this popular guy and um you know he's kind of you know life of

1486
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:52,200
the party kind of guy and then uh you know he becomes a brother and he's you know in a in a

1487
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:57,080
monastery and he starts to become more religious and he's on mount laverne he's hiking with his

1488
02:14:57,080 --> 02:15:03,320
confidant brother leo who like records all the stuff that happens to him and uh he basically has

1489
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:10,280
an encounter with an angel and the angel burns him and basically you know oh i remember this now

1490
02:15:10,280 --> 02:15:15,000
it gives him you know what he calls this he sees he says it's like a vision of christ but if you

1491
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:20,120
actually go back to the original translation which pesolka did it's a flaming torch and which was it

1492
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:30,680
uh it must have been uh uh latin oh latin yeah i think so medieval right yeah yeah probably latin

1493
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:37,800
okay um so saint francis of assisi was when like uh in medieval time 13th century i think yeah okay

1494
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:45,640
yeah um so like the subplot of the whole thing was saint francis of assisi is like he has basically

1495
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:50,920
electromagnetic radiation damage and he calls it the stigmata he says it's a vision of christ but

1496
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:56,680
like it's probably what you would say is just electromagnetic radiation now and he dies from

1497
02:15:56,680 --> 02:16:02,200
this stuff and if you look at the files given to gary nolan on people who've had you know paranormal

1498
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:07,560
you know it basically encounters with ufos and with you know alien beings it's often electromagnetic

1499
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:13,800
damage and you know ultraviolet burns and you you know i think some of these truths have been

1500
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:17,240
disseminated through fiction if you watch close encounters of the third kind the guy's a sunburn

1501
02:16:17,240 --> 02:16:21,240
after he sees a ufo and i think steven spielberg definitely has some spooky sources and he has

1502
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:28,120
across the years and so i think calling these things into your i think there are two things

1503
02:16:28,120 --> 02:16:34,600
that attract this stuff nuclear and and certain states of consciousness and uh the latter is

1504
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:38,600
going to you know give a lot of people you know an allergic reaction if you're coming from kind

1505
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:44,200
of like a you know more western materialist reductionist you know academia you know that's

1506
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:48,520
that's that's where you're coming from but i do believe that's that's part of it and um

1507
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:54,520
calling these things into your purview can be very dangerous a la all the files that nolan looked at

1508
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:59,880
and a la what happened to you know st francis of assisi and i think as with all this stuff there's

1509
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:04,280
a left-hand path and there's a right way to do it and the left-hand path is basically a cult stuff

1510
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:09,320
it's like trying to summon stuff and yeah you're gonna get burned it's it's like it's a typical

1511
02:17:09,320 --> 02:17:15,640
every myth whether it's lord of the rings faust prometheus it always ends badly we've seen this

1512
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:20,920
movie before if you want the secret knowledge and you don't have the right you know pure intention

1513
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:25,560
in your heart you're just going to get burned because what you see will be an excavation of

1514
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:31,000
what's inside of you i mean that

1515
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:41,560
so you're saying that first of all when it comes to gary nolan he was looking at people who

1516
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:49,480
who these people that he studied people that got injured and or died yep right after having radiation

1517
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:55,000
poisoning or something like this from these these things those people how were they getting in

1518
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,960
contact with these things were they summoning them so that's a total black box i don't know

1519
02:17:59,960 --> 02:18:04,920
i have no idea but i just think coming into contact with them it's like you know the legend

1520
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:08,520
i'm not saying the ark of the covenant is real but this is a good analogy it's like you know the

1521
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:13,000
holiest of holies if you don't go in with a pure heart it's going to be bad for you i think dealing

1522
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:20,360
if you're dealing with this other world it's it's it's going to you know kind of see you from the

1523
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:26,120
inside now and it's going to be very bad for you if you it's it's a it's a classic myth and i think

1524
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:30,360
it's and i think it's it's not just myth i think it's very real i think we live inside of a cave

1525
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:34,840
basically and and that cave is our kind of perceptive epistemology and if you want to see

1526
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:39,640
something that's outside of the cave you can ask for it and it can come and you're going to get

1527
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:42,840
you know hit like a load of bricks if you ask with the wrong intention

1528
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:51,480
what you're describing sounds a lot like a psychedelic trip it's the exact it's very similar

1529
02:18:52,280 --> 02:18:58,280
because if you go into a psychedelic trip and you have a lot of ego going in yeah you're going to

1530
02:18:58,280 --> 02:19:02,920
get smashed yeah it's going and it's going to excavate it but it's not necessarily bad for you

1531
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:08,520
it'll excavate what's inside of you often but it needs to be done in a way that like you can handle

1532
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:13,000
and honestly i don't believe in psych that's why i don't believe in like i believe in like veterans

1533
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:17,800
who are like on their last legs who need to take like ibogaine or like of course like you know or

1534
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:23,560
like you know mushrooms or whatever but like this like oh let's just like you know willy-nilly do

1535
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:29,160
this recreationally that i don't think that's going to be good at all the the veil we have it's

1536
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:32,840
definitely not for everybody it's not it's not we have the veil for a reason you don't want to

1537
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:38,040
unveil everything all at once right and so i i do believe that we have a very limited scope we only

1538
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:42,920
see between 400 and 700 nanometers on the electromagnetic wave spectrum you know our

1539
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:48,360
decibel range that we hear is limited like yeah the idea that like there's nothing outside of

1540
02:19:48,360 --> 02:19:53,640
what we see is ridiculous and then you have people like donald hoffman cognitive psychologists

1541
02:19:53,720 --> 02:20:00,200
showing that what we see are basically like icons of reality like they're categorizations of reality

1542
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:05,400
like you're not seeing electromagnetic wavelengths you're not seeing the waves themselves you are

1543
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:09,960
seeing this table right because you need to instantly categorize things yes so the idea

1544
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:16,120
that we are seeing ground reality is crazy and then the idea that physics is the end of history

1545
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:19,880
is also crazy like our consciousness definitely plays a part in what we're seeing you say you

1546
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:24,280
experience synchronicities all the time you're basically admitting that your personal

1547
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:29,160
epistemology is out of step with the western materialist dogma you're admitting that and

1548
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:33,560
saying that and maybe you're saying i don't know it could be like the pattern matching of my mind

1549
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:37,400
or whatever but if you like get down to it with most people they're like yeah a bunch of shit

1550
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:40,280
happened to me that's like beyond chance and probability and there's probably something

1551
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:46,280
with your consciousness that affects the material world or whatever so i think it's not beyond the

1552
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:50,840
pale to say like if you want to experience something paranormal you probably will if you

1553
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:58,760
like you know do certain things and doing that in a reckless way is very bad and doing that honestly

1554
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:05,720
it's the whole issue i think with the ufo thing like the whole context of this conversation is

1555
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:11,560
around weaponization of this stuff yeah and in certain cases i always like my rallying cry is

1556
02:21:11,560 --> 02:21:15,400
like it's actually bad for national security because like i want the powers that be to let

1557
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:19,320
more out so that's like i'll say that right like it's bad for national security if the left hand

1558
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:23,160
isn't talking to the right hand and like russia and china have their own ufo programs and they're

1559
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:28,520
like beating us but my motivation is not weaponizing these things like i just i kind of

1560
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:32,760
want to like poke the bear a little so they like let more out yeah because they are holding on to

1561
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:37,800
a lot of stuff but the whole the fact that all this whole conversation is couched in like how

1562
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:43,400
can we build weapons out of the like this like meta material that like is like mana from heaven

1563
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:49,080
is so perverse and fucked yeah and so like my whole goal like to the extent that i ever do

1564
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:56,200
anything in a capitalist context with the ufos stuff it's i want civil side infrastructure updates

1565
02:21:56,200 --> 02:22:01,960
in the our cities to make our lives better and i want more meaning in the world in people's

1566
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:08,600
individual lives and if i can do that and have top cover from national security people who are like

1567
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:13,960
yeah if you find something dual use we'll take it to the back room and work on it fine i'm cool

1568
02:22:13,960 --> 02:22:19,000
with protecting the free world and making sure we're ahead of china and russia but the whole idea

1569
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:23,880
that like people's impetus into this topic like that the fact that they're into it is just like

1570
02:22:23,880 --> 02:22:28,600
let's weaponize this like immediately is so fucked like you don't know what you're dealing with it

1571
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:33,480
probably is angels i mean that's that's the whole reason that we have everything that we have is i

1572
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:39,160
mean the most absurd and mind-blowing science and technology that we have was literally created in

1573
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:44,600
the context of war like john von neumann like you were saying the brain power of that motherfucker

1574
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:51,400
yeah like was literally used and monopolized for war like they the i think i think it was him was

1575
02:22:51,400 --> 02:22:57,560
i think he was the one that calculated the exact elevation that the fat man little boy nukes needed

1576
02:22:57,560 --> 02:23:03,000
to be to cause the most civilian casualties like he he estimated the exact elevation they needed

1577
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:08,680
to detonate those apps to kill the most people it's death that's death yeah it's so yeah i didn't

1578
02:23:08,680 --> 02:23:13,480
even know that's a that's a crazy yeah that's brilliant i mean in in anny jacobson's pentagon

1579
02:23:13,480 --> 02:23:19,160
brain book all about the history of darpa wow dude one of the most insane books yeah it's

1580
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:25,000
that's an amazing book that's one of my favorite books she's amazing what like an epic chronicler

1581
02:23:25,560 --> 02:23:27,880
just love her man yeah and her voice god

1582
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:34,760
she's a great voice she has like the best podcast she has the best voice the best voice

1583
02:23:34,760 --> 02:23:41,880
she's so seductive so funny yeah she's awesome but yeah no i don't know how i don't like

1584
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:45,960
going to what you're saying i don't know yeah how you break the out of that right like how do you

1585
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:50,840
break out of that that's that's the way the world works yeah that's the way the world works the the

1586
02:23:51,320 --> 02:23:58,760
the the main motivation for technological innovation is for super bow superpowers

1587
02:23:58,760 --> 02:24:07,080
to maintain their power and to gain more power well i think i mean again this requires a predisposition

1588
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:11,560
to some pretty trippy kind of ontological world views but like i think the veil is dropping i

1589
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:16,120
think like we're seeing more of this stuff now and it might be because we're not being super

1590
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:20,520
responsible with our world we live in this multipolar nuclear world and you're right to

1591
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:26,040
the extent we have access to you know anything off the books and you know of celestial origin

1592
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:32,200
or whatever we're weaponizing it immediately and you know things are just not good on a global

1593
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:37,240
scale right now no so i think what we might be seeing is kind of intervention a la the three

1594
02:24:37,240 --> 02:24:41,640
body problem or ufos and nukes with robert hastings where if you talk to any of these guys

1595
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:45,240
any of the icbm security personnel any of these people you know firsthand witnesses

1596
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:51,800
their first instinct is always they're trying to tell us to like stop our way you know to like

1597
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:57,320
you know hang back and like not destroy ourselves so and then you can get into the mike masters

1598
02:24:57,320 --> 02:25:02,200
things where it's like you know is it some future version of humanity that is coming back in time

1599
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:09,320
trying to protect sustain the existence of the human timeline because like we're going to blow

1600
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:14,520
ourselves up yeah and who would care more than the future version of ourselves it's like and back to

1601
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:20,200
the future where it's like you know marty goes back in time because he wants his parents you

1602
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:25,960
know to be together yeah yeah and what mike says about that the pedomorphism yep thing that happens

1603
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:31,880
how our ancestors that when the adults look more like the children of our of our descendants yep

1604
02:25:31,880 --> 02:25:36,280
is crazy that and that's like like all the depictions of aliens look like children

1605
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:41,400
yeah that's right so in 500 000 years fully grown adults are going to look more like the toddlers of

1606
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:46,760
today if you were to ask any conventional biologist like somebody who doesn't believe in

1607
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:51,480
aliens what will humanity look like in a few thousand years you'd say okay humans are getting

1608
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:56,440
domesticated so we're losing the melanin in our skin so it's getting kind of more pale our brains

1609
02:25:56,440 --> 02:26:02,680
are becoming selected for because of more white collar work so cranial size gets much bigger nose

1610
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:07,480
and ears they don't matter so much because you know we're not hunter gathering right we yes there

1611
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:13,400
is pedomorphosis there's neoteny we retain the larval features like of like young people in our

1612
02:26:13,400 --> 02:26:16,680
you know basically like your kids are going to look like what your ancestors look like in the

1613
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:23,000
future right and and we're becoming domesticated a dog is to a wolf what we will look like you know

1614
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:28,600
in the future is to us right and so i think yeah and then if you look at like all the databases

1615
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:34,920
around ufo abductions over 50 percent in almost all cases are hominid creatures you know so and

1616
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:39,720
and then and then you think the the likelihood of evolutionary convergence on zeta reticuli

1617
02:26:39,720 --> 02:26:44,680
proxima centauri of on them looking like hominid beings what are the changes their atmosphere their

1618
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:50,840
gravity their solar system everything like like were they water worlds i know most of the godilocks

1619
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:54,760
planets that we've discovered have been water worlds if i'm not mistaken so like if they evolved

1620
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:58,440
in a world that was mostly water yeah it wouldn't look anything like us are they going to have a

1621
02:26:58,440 --> 02:27:02,680
brain that's directly on top of the head you have eight million species on earth and you have like

1622
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:06,600
20 upright hominid exactly and then you have like one one that figured out the technology

1623
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:10,520
right so you're saying like a gray looks exactly like us it doesn't make any sense that blew my

1624
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:17,720
mind the most out of that book is how rare we are yes as as a species homo sapiens on planet earth

1625
02:27:17,720 --> 02:27:25,240
which is a a planet that's teeming with fucking life yes and how few planets that we've discovered

1626
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:30,520
that are habitable of life and like what how much like he was basically saying it's like we are zero

1627
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:35,720
point zero zero zero one percent of the species on this earth so if you extrapolate that out into

1628
02:27:35,720 --> 02:27:39,480
the universe and how many planets are able to inhabit life what's the chance they're going to

1629
02:27:39,480 --> 02:27:45,880
look like us like like that accurate yeah yeah it seems almost like impossible yeah no it's the

1630
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:51,240
exactly it's the likelihood and if you're seeing a thing in your neighborhood it's more likely to

1631
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:55,480
be related it's think about like north sentinel island is off the coast of india and they never

1632
02:27:55,480 --> 02:27:59,160
get visited occasionally by missionaries and they'll kill the missionaries right and they

1633
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:03,560
probably think when people visit them like you know you're just some white dude and you like show

1634
02:28:03,560 --> 02:28:08,040
up there they'd be like you're an alien because they don't know the rest of the world exists

1635
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:11,800
if you see a thing in your neighborhood and it looks like you it's probably an extension of you

1636
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:15,960
it's probably related to you that's just kind of ockham's razor yeah so and then we have 20

1637
02:28:15,960 --> 02:28:21,160
billion you know earth-like planets in the you know milky way galaxy so people love to say that

1638
02:28:21,720 --> 02:28:25,560
but then you have over a trillion non-earth-like planets so again the likelihood that you are

1639
02:28:25,560 --> 02:28:28,760
seeing a thing in your neighborhood that looks like you doesn't only look like you looks like

1640
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:32,920
what you probably are going to look like in a certain amount of time from a conventional

1641
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:37,960
evolutionary biology perspective yeah it's probably i love the mike masters thesis as a result of that

1642
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:42,840
where i think mike where i would disagree with him or where i think he might fall slightly short

1643
02:28:42,840 --> 02:28:47,800
and he would probably admit this because he's again he's done amazing foundational work is like

1644
02:28:48,760 --> 02:28:54,680
i don't know if it's us from the future i think we might be stuck in a time-bound reality where

1645
02:28:54,680 --> 02:29:01,240
we're subject to zeno's arrow of time where we are kind of indelibly permanently moving forward

1646
02:29:01,240 --> 02:29:07,640
in zeno's arrow of time and they have some ability to do trans temporal stuff where they can time

1647
02:29:07,640 --> 02:29:12,360
travel and so you get into all all these weird questions of like if time travel is future is

1648
02:29:12,360 --> 02:29:15,800
possible at any point in the future which he's saying it is right with his book because they're

1649
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:20,040
saying they're coming back in time they wouldn't be able to go back past when that time machine

1650
02:29:20,040 --> 02:29:24,200
was created is that right that's right then it's always been inherently available if time travel

1651
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:28,040
is available at any point in the future it's always been available inherently right so that

1652
02:29:28,040 --> 02:29:31,720
means time travel would have been figured out somewhere else in the universe yes that's right

1653
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:37,000
and so then you get into these questions of like you have the angels and demons ontology and you

1654
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:43,240
have the human future time travel to ontology i think a really valid you know use of like a

1655
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:48,360
think tank would be like how do those two things comport are these ascended humans that have

1656
02:29:48,360 --> 02:29:53,720
trans temporal capabilities time travel capabilities that are like the next step on

1657
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:58,600
the evolutionary chain and but they like saying future is kind of a misnomer because in their

1658
02:29:58,600 --> 02:30:03,880
paradigm time doesn't even exist the way it exists in ours right so i don't know you get into all

1659
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:09,880
sorts of like crazy rabbit holes but what i love about that book is it's just it's very scientific

1660
02:30:09,880 --> 02:30:15,000
goes through cases and it goes through data to the extent we have data unfortunately the data is kind

1661
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:19,640
of scant but it goes through the data and it just makes a very compelling ground up argument

1662
02:30:20,200 --> 02:30:25,400
for why time travel is involved and why they're related to humans and not just you know the time

1663
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:30,360
dilation paradox thing is really interesting too like how he said that i love the part where

1664
02:30:30,360 --> 02:30:36,760
he's talking about like if we sent some um interstellar crew out into the universe to

1665
02:30:36,760 --> 02:30:42,680
find another planet or whatever he's like 20 years of their rocket time would be like a

1666
02:30:42,680 --> 02:30:48,040
hundred thousand years of our time here on earth totally so by like so half like 20 years into

1667
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:54,040
their trip we we would have figured out technology on earth to be able to blow past them and like he's

1668
02:30:54,040 --> 02:30:59,080
he's like he's like 20 years into their trip we're gonna have people from earth passing them and they

1669
02:30:59,080 --> 02:31:03,880
just left that morning with a belly full of breakfast and they're like what the fuck we

1670
02:31:03,880 --> 02:31:09,640
wasted our entire lives on this like uh-huh that's an interesting paradox too oh it's a fascinating

1671
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:16,280
one any of the whole planet of the apes that yeah it's like the time itself is very weird

1672
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:20,760
in general relativity you have time dilation which we just described the twin paradox all that stuff

1673
02:31:21,400 --> 02:31:26,360
and then in quantum stuff i don't think we quite understand time we take it as like this formal

1674
02:31:26,360 --> 02:31:33,400
axiom in schrodinger's equation but it's actually kind of really weird and like time and gravity are

1675
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:40,520
coupled in general relativity the closer you get to a gravitational source time slows and in quantum

1676
02:31:40,520 --> 02:31:44,280
stuff you can't fit we can't figure out gravity that's this big field of quantum gravity which

1677
02:31:44,280 --> 02:31:47,880
has turned into string theory which is like we've never been able to solve for for gravity we've

1678
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:53,080
never been able to you know um fully you know uh figure that out i love that documentary you did

1679
02:31:53,080 --> 02:31:58,680
too with eric weinstein and uh yeah that was fun man like like string theory is some limited

1680
02:31:58,680 --> 02:32:03,400
hangout or something that's basically distract yeah eric makes that proposition he goes i don't

1681
02:32:03,400 --> 02:32:07,400
know he goes if you were trying to limit the physics string theory would be a pretty good way

1682
02:32:07,400 --> 02:32:13,960
to do it which that's gets beyond me okay it's like is string theory this like padded walls

1683
02:32:13,960 --> 02:32:21,080
2d version of the real physics that they have in the back room and it's just this like initiation

1684
02:32:21,080 --> 02:32:25,640
recruitment thing but it's like less dangerous i don't know if you can do that deliberately that

1685
02:32:25,640 --> 02:32:32,040
seems like maybe like beyond human coordination abilities that it gets beyond my physics knowledge

1686
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:36,680
and eric might be able to speak to that more in a more sophisticated way as to like why that might

1687
02:32:36,680 --> 02:32:42,120
even be possible but crazy thing that he said that really that really resonated with me in that video

1688
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:47,880
was he was like look at the civil war in 1860 at less than a human lifetime later we figured out

1689
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:52,760
the fucking atom bomb yeah yeah i had to drop an atom bomb out of a plane in less than a hundred

1690
02:32:52,920 --> 02:32:58,120
years less than a hundred years less than a hundred years i mean so like just the understanding of

1691
02:32:58,120 --> 02:33:04,440
physics how that changes changes our world and our technology and our civilization we were using

1692
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:10,760
muskets and yeah dude and from muskets to nukes to nukes and if you take the three body problems

1693
02:33:10,760 --> 02:33:16,920
seriously where you have the fermi paradox where it's like can you explain the three body problem

1694
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:19,720
for people who might not comprehend it yeah it's like these these tricellarian

1695
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:25,400
aliens that like we've been in contact with it takes place actually originally in the cultural

1696
02:33:25,400 --> 02:33:31,080
revolution in china and you have all these like scientists getting kind of like stamped out or

1697
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:38,280
whatever and then you have modern scientists that are making contact with aliens and often it's in

1698
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:42,760
these extremely advanced science projects like particle accelerators at places like cern

1699
02:33:42,760 --> 02:33:48,840
and they're getting all sorts of like interesting comms from the aliens and the tricellarian aliens

1700
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:53,880
are like in touch with the government and they're like you cannot tell the populace that we are in

1701
02:33:53,880 --> 02:33:58,200
touch with you because it's going to like kind of you know it's going to tip off mass hysteria so

1702
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:03,560
we have to like slowly infiltrate ourselves which is by the way very similar to arthur c clark's

1703
02:34:03,560 --> 02:34:08,360
amazing book childhood's end and i think this idea that like an alien civilization is slowly

1704
02:34:08,360 --> 02:34:15,080
incepting itself is very popular and actually probably a good answer to the you know fermi

1705
02:34:15,080 --> 02:34:20,520
paradox if you were incredibly sophisticated you wouldn't show up as this foreign invader hominid

1706
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:24,120
you would just incept yourself you'd create hybrids you do genetic experiment you do all sorts of

1707
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:29,320
stuff so what what were we just talking about why did i bring up the three-body problem do you

1708
02:34:29,320 --> 02:34:36,120
remember i forgot um oh we're talking about yeah yeah muskets to nukes yeah to nukes so like if

1709
02:34:36,120 --> 02:34:40,200
you take the three-body problem like in the three-body problem there's this dark forest analogy

1710
02:34:40,760 --> 02:34:46,520
and it's like the the universe could be teeming with life and it could be adaptive from the

1711
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:51,720
perspective of an alien race to not show themselves to you because they're worried that you're going

1712
02:34:51,720 --> 02:34:57,480
to kill them or like going to harm them and why would they care until you start creating nukes

1713
02:34:57,480 --> 02:35:01,960
or like certain things that like maybe you reach a certain level of consciousness maybe you create

1714
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:06,920
a nuke maybe it's high energy physics and maybe it's certain people reaching certain levels of

1715
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:11,480
consciousness and then all of a sudden they make themselves known where it's like you're living

1716
02:35:11,480 --> 02:35:16,760
you you're living in this time-bound simulation and you're poking at the edges of the simulation

1717
02:35:16,760 --> 02:35:21,960
you can do it with consciousness you do with high energy physics and you know here we are like trying

1718
02:35:21,960 --> 02:35:27,160
to like you know guard guard the simulation um and like make sure you're not going to like

1719
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:33,080
mess anything up in a big way um and so i think that's actually a very good answer to the Fermi

1720
02:35:33,080 --> 02:35:37,720
paradox it's like why don't they show themselves well there's actually like probably evolutionarily

1721
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:41,560
adaptive for them to not show themselves it like makes more sense that they wouldn't in many ways

1722
02:35:41,560 --> 02:35:49,160
yes yes yeah that does make a lot of sense so you think what what are your thoughts on on the

1723
02:35:49,160 --> 02:35:53,640
whole string theory thing do you think that it's like i know i know eric's like gone off the rails

1724
02:35:53,640 --> 02:35:58,840
with it he says michikaku he's had a controller he's talked to michikaku yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm on

1725
02:35:58,840 --> 02:36:06,680
eric's side like i think clearly it doesn't work and like it doesn't take eric or any physicist

1726
02:36:06,680 --> 02:36:11,320
like you or me can say it doesn't work it like name me like a piece of technology that's come from

1727
02:36:11,320 --> 02:36:15,960
string theory right can't name anything unfortunately name me something that's come from quantum field

1728
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:22,920
theory like semiconductors like a third of our economy quantum field theory so yeah so it's

1729
02:36:22,920 --> 02:36:28,760
like one thing is like this you're lost in like science is the map and not the territory in my

1730
02:36:28,760 --> 02:36:34,760
belief so yes like my my metaphysical worldview is more like play-doh like it's like there's

1731
02:36:34,760 --> 02:36:38,920
something beyond us that's true it exists in the world of like forms and ideas but like when it

1732
02:36:38,920 --> 02:36:44,360
comes to science i'm more kind of Aristotelian in that what is useful is true and the quantum stuff

1733
02:36:44,360 --> 02:36:48,920
is eminently useful if you want the most accurate sensor it's a quantum sensor if you want the best

1734
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:56,280
computer you know eventually it'll be a quantum computer you know quantum stuff just seems to

1735
02:36:56,280 --> 02:37:01,640
work incredibly well especially at like lower scale subatomic scales and it's really useful

1736
02:37:01,640 --> 02:37:08,760
from an engineering standpoint and string theory is just basically trying to force fit what

1737
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:15,400
describes our kind of cosmological worldviews of general with general relativity and quantum

1738
02:37:15,400 --> 02:37:20,600
field theory force fit them with math and so you have a map here that's not the map is not

1739
02:37:20,600 --> 02:37:25,080
the territory so you have stuff that you can do cool things with with quantum field theory you

1740
02:37:25,080 --> 02:37:29,720
have some stuff you can do cool things with with general relativity neither are descriptors of the

1741
02:37:29,720 --> 02:37:34,280
underlying reality so the maps are going to be a little jagged and off string theory is like you

1742
02:37:34,280 --> 02:37:39,960
have these jagged off maps that aren't perfect and you are forcing them together with math like it

1743
02:37:39,960 --> 02:37:44,680
doesn't take a genius like you or i could look at that and be like that's the wrong approach

1744
02:37:44,680 --> 02:37:50,120
yeah it's just the wrong approach so that's the way i look at it from like a more high level

1745
02:37:50,760 --> 02:37:56,440
perspective as to like you know whether it's some limited hangout there are all these really

1746
02:37:56,440 --> 02:38:01,800
interesting things i've uncovered with so the people that funded quantum gravity were you know

1747
02:38:01,800 --> 02:38:06,680
it was like uh uh initially kind of established at this chapel hill conference at university of

1748
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:12,120
north carolina in 1957 yeah and it was this guy agnew bonson and he was obsessed with gravity

1749
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:17,080
wasn't there also a guy named dewitt and then bryce dewitt yeah institute of field physics was

1750
02:38:17,800 --> 02:38:25,320
bonson's outfit and bryce dewitt was his chief theoretical physicist and he's basically convening

1751
02:38:25,320 --> 02:38:29,240
the top physicists in the world at the time i don't think anybody would argue with this like

1752
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:35,480
john wheeler peter bergman you know freeman dyson like these legends and they're all trying to figure

1753
02:38:35,480 --> 02:38:41,640
out why gravity breaks down you know at subatomic scale so like why gravity doesn't work with

1754
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:46,200
quantum stuff and that establishes the field of quantum gravity from which you could say string

1755
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:53,080
theory is like a later offshoot right this is the crazy part bonson in the back room is funding

1756
02:38:53,080 --> 02:38:58,760
towns and brown and in my opinion i've uncovered all sorts of stuff as to why towns and brown

1757
02:38:58,760 --> 02:39:05,240
experimentally is figuring out real physics and is using these capacitors and with high voltage

1758
02:39:05,240 --> 02:39:11,560
experimentation in a way that ostensibly seems to create some sort of connection between a

1759
02:39:11,560 --> 02:39:15,880
electromagnetism and gravity which again if you were to talk to any conventional physicist they'd

1760
02:39:15,880 --> 02:39:20,920
be like if you can experimentally do that that is crazy leads to all sorts of amazing possibilities

1761
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:26,760
yeah propulsion comms whatever and so i think bonson was like funding some like you know back

1762
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:31,480
of the house research with this guy towns and brown who was according to a couple of books this

1763
02:39:31,480 --> 02:39:37,800
guy paula paula violette um he was maybe even at the chapel hill conference and the thing about

1764
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:42,280
brown is he was never an amazing theoretician he was more of an experimentalist he was more

1765
02:39:42,280 --> 02:39:47,880
of a tesla type and he actually wasn't like traditionally super credentialed but he had

1766
02:39:47,880 --> 02:39:52,840
theories around what he was doing and i i think he was kind of breaking physics and and there

1767
02:39:52,840 --> 02:39:56,040
are all these kind of credible witnesses who saw what he was doing and were freaked out edward

1768
02:39:56,040 --> 02:40:01,000
teller was one of those witnesses who freaked out kurtis lame witnessed his experiments and so

1769
02:40:01,800 --> 02:40:04,920
you know i think he was doing some really interesting off the book stuff and then

1770
02:40:04,920 --> 02:40:10,520
meanwhile academic physics is being sent into a cul-de-sac being sent into a dead end is that

1771
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:15,160
incidental and emergent i don't know i'm not i don't know how conspiratorial to be about that

1772
02:40:15,160 --> 02:40:21,080
but it's fascinating yeah um jeremy riss was explained to me alien scientist yeah he's awesome

1773
02:40:21,080 --> 02:40:26,440
he does great work on the he's like a fucking historian on this anti-gravity history he really

1774
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:32,040
is yeah it's good the the amount of knowledge he has is on is unimaginable oh yeah but like i

1775
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:39,800
think he was explained to me that um dewitt and witten were both working on this stuff previous

1776
02:40:39,800 --> 02:40:44,680
to that north carolina summit event or whatever yes so yes so okay and then here's the interesting

1777
02:40:44,680 --> 02:40:49,560
string theory connection lewis witten was the representative of that conference from rias which

1778
02:40:49,560 --> 02:40:54,600
is martin corporation's anti-gravity research group and so martin corporation is pre-lockheed

1779
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:59,160
merger so it's the original lockheed martin has like an anti-gravity research group lewis witten

1780
02:40:59,160 --> 02:41:04,120
is researching gravity and he even says this there's a there's a video online where he says

1781
02:41:04,120 --> 02:41:09,160
i was uh i was meant to research gravity and right right field told me to research gravity

1782
02:41:09,160 --> 02:41:13,080
the whole conference is sponsored by right airfield that's crazy which is the epicenter

1783
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:19,480
of all ufo lore bryce dewitt almost worked at rias as well and then he ended up at the

1784
02:41:19,480 --> 02:41:23,240
institute of field physics there are all these interesting aerospace connections john there

1785
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:29,400
was so much it was so bound up in aerospace that john wheeler would complain at like the how like

1786
02:41:29,400 --> 02:41:34,600
tied in air tied to aerospace and anti-gravity like he he kept being like the you know all this

1787
02:41:34,600 --> 02:41:38,520
talk of anti-gravity it's just too much like we have to figure this out in like a serious academic

1788
02:41:38,520 --> 02:41:45,240
way yeah but that just shows you the prevailing ethos of you know the place itself and so it's

1789
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:50,680
really fascinating right field had its own this guy named josh goldberg who is a phd from syracuse

1790
02:41:50,680 --> 02:41:54,920
and they were systematically studying anti-gravity anti-gravity in the 50s was

1791
02:41:54,920 --> 02:42:00,360
you know louis witten even says this in the wind meaning it was everywhere but it also the other

1792
02:42:00,360 --> 02:42:05,080
meaning of in the wind it's it's a spy term that could mean in the dark and so it's really

1793
02:42:05,080 --> 02:42:09,160
interesting like that there could be some double meaning there so the the tie between quantum

1794
02:42:09,160 --> 02:42:13,640
gravity and string theory is louis witten's son is a guy named ed witten yeah ed witten is the

1795
02:42:13,640 --> 02:42:19,000
number one string theorist you know in the world bar none and this is the guy that that eric was

1796
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:23,400
talking about on the joe rogan podcast saying this guy is like untouchable he's like i'm so

1797
02:42:23,400 --> 02:42:28,120
scared michael jordan yeah yeah yeah exactly i'm so intimidated by this guy's intel intelligence

1798
02:42:28,120 --> 02:42:33,480
yeah exactly like alien level yeah exactly so so that's ed witten so that's the son of the guy

1799
02:42:33,480 --> 02:42:38,840
studying anti-gravity with martin corporation and establishing quantum gravity which is this

1800
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:44,600
cul-de-sac so like your son is like the king of the cul-de-sac and like maybe there's some

1801
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:48,360
interesting updates going on in the back of the house with guys like towns and brown who also

1802
02:42:48,360 --> 02:42:54,840
has a work history at martin corporation right he joined martin corporation in 1943 or two or

1803
02:42:54,840 --> 02:43:00,840
three right when skunk work starts the same year skunk work starts so there's some interesting

1804
02:43:00,840 --> 02:43:06,840
weird connections there a lot of smoke i don't have fire so this louis witten fella has anyone

1805
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:13,320
talked to him have you ever talked to him has eric ever talked to him he is i think 99 years old or

1806
02:43:13,320 --> 02:43:19,080
something like say it's like in so he's super old and i have a friend who has corresponded

1807
02:43:19,960 --> 02:43:25,320
over email with him and as soon as he said you know hey i want to get into the anti-gravity stuff

1808
02:43:25,320 --> 02:43:32,280
the the line went dark and he stopped responding emails i make of it that we've made updates in the

1809
02:43:32,280 --> 02:43:38,200
world of gravity that are off the books and not and he you don't even need me to say this like

1810
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:42,120
like the national science foundation is now coming out with these podcasts talking about

1811
02:43:42,120 --> 02:43:47,000
extended electrodynamics and literally scientific frameworks that if i were to say this a year ago

1812
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:52,200
to you you'd be like that's quacky it doesn't make any sense and like this was relegated to like

1813
02:43:52,200 --> 02:43:56,840
zero point energy conferences in the southwest like that you know some crystal healer would

1814
02:43:56,840 --> 02:44:01,400
tell you about extended electrodynamics and you'd be like okay yeah go get but it's being

1815
02:44:01,400 --> 02:44:07,640
vindicated as real and uh electro-gravitics being vindicated a lot of people who are high up have

1816
02:44:07,640 --> 02:44:13,160
kind of like hey you're kind of on to things some things with this stuff and um i i just

1817
02:44:13,160 --> 02:44:18,680
interviewed carl nel who's the army representative for the uap task force worked alongside grush

1818
02:44:18,680 --> 02:44:23,800
extremely smart was the deputy cto of northrop grumman part of what the argument i made in my

1819
02:44:23,800 --> 02:44:28,520
towns and brown documentary is that some of this gravity you know interesting gravity stuff made

1820
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:33,000
it into the b2 stealth bomber some of brown's work this is like the ion wind stuff like the

1821
02:44:33,640 --> 02:44:37,400
yes somehow because it looks like the the stealth bombers they look like

1822
02:44:37,400 --> 02:44:41,880
they defy gravity because they don't look built like they're like unless they have some super

1823
02:44:41,880 --> 02:44:51,080
powerful jet engines the the uh which they do but most legendary air airspace journalist in uh the

1824
02:44:51,080 --> 02:44:57,400
uk was a guy named bill gunston and he's writing a survey level overview of all aero tech you know

1825
02:44:57,480 --> 02:45:03,480
aero engine technology um since world war ii and he gets to the b2 stealth bomber and he says

1826
02:45:04,120 --> 02:45:11,160
um you know i do not wish to reside in the tower of london so i will refrain from talking about

1827
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:17,480
clever wings with leading edges charged to millions of volts positive with trailing edges

1828
02:45:17,480 --> 02:45:21,720
charged to millions of volts negative he's talking about the b2 stealth bomber and um

1829
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:29,320
your aerospace uh uh or aviation week aviation week bill scott another you know amazing uh

1830
02:45:29,320 --> 02:45:35,880
aviation journalist he says you know when when the b2 gets revealed you know early 90s he's like

1831
02:45:35,880 --> 02:45:41,960
the b2 surfs its own wave and uses a bifield brown effect some people even think b2 is stands for

1832
02:45:41,960 --> 02:45:49,560
bifield brown wow and so the majority owner of northrup where the b2 came from northrop grumman

1833
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:54,600
so this is pre-merger with grumman the majority owner or the majority investor rather there's a

1834
02:45:54,600 --> 02:46:00,040
guy named floyd odlam he's a lawyer he's a financier for an aerospace he's funding brown's

1835
02:46:00,040 --> 02:46:07,320
research in santa monica right and the the research fails quote unquote in 67 then in 68

1836
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:12,520
three months later because the end of 67 early 68 they publish a paper northrup saying we are

1837
02:46:12,520 --> 02:46:18,920
looking into electro aerodynamics and um and it's this paper that was archived in the american

1838
02:46:18,920 --> 02:46:23,560
institute of astronautics and aeronautics aeronautics and astronautics and that paper

1839
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:28,360
just goes missing and so they retract that paper and say oh there's nothing to see here whatever

1840
02:46:28,360 --> 02:46:33,160
and then a couple decades later the b2 stealth bomber gets revealed so it's like you tell me

1841
02:46:33,160 --> 02:46:41,240
like i think there's a there there so so so basically in the 50s before that conference

1842
02:46:41,240 --> 02:46:47,560
in north carolina yeah like the idea is that or what eric was speculating is a possibility that

1843
02:46:47,560 --> 02:46:52,440
this stuff just went dark and got captured by these aerospace companies and like they came up

1844
02:46:52,440 --> 02:46:58,680
with a plan to basically like deceive the public send the public down the string theory rabbit

1845
02:46:58,680 --> 02:47:04,040
hole and take all this stuff that dewitt and witton and brown were doing and make this part

1846
02:47:04,040 --> 02:47:09,160
of this secret black project stuff i think it's hard to say whether we just had updates in

1847
02:47:09,160 --> 02:47:14,840
topological physics and experimental physics and we figured out some anomalies and like locally

1848
02:47:14,840 --> 02:47:19,560
useful frameworks where it's like we know how this works in the context of a single you know this

1849
02:47:19,560 --> 02:47:25,000
stealth aircraft but like how generalizable that gets like how much you can do with that i don't

1850
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:29,800
know it's a total black box to me and i don't know how coordinated the sequestering of that

1851
02:47:30,440 --> 02:47:35,480
there's a ton of smoke there's there's not a lot of fire it's just hard to say and then you can

1852
02:47:35,480 --> 02:47:40,600
either say it was like sequestered by you know just humans you know where it's like you need

1853
02:47:40,600 --> 02:47:44,840
you need top side science you need black side science or whatever which we definitely have i

1854
02:47:44,840 --> 02:47:49,320
mean that's ridiculous to say we don't even like and you know uh mark and reese and ben horowitz

1855
02:47:49,320 --> 02:47:53,000
i think we're at the white house and like some national security council person was like yeah

1856
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:57,720
we're gonna like regulate ai just like we regulated physics in the past physics you're talking about

1857
02:47:57,720 --> 02:48:02,520
physics so like this has definitely been done the idea that hasn't been done is absurd yeah um and

1858
02:48:02,520 --> 02:48:06,360
so is that coordinated on a human level do you believe the three body problem stuff where the

1859
02:48:06,360 --> 02:48:11,400
aliens are controlling the way science emerges to begin with right and like are they like playing

1860
02:48:11,400 --> 02:48:15,480
deceptive tricks on our top scientists and then like inspiring other scientists like

1861
02:48:15,480 --> 02:48:18,760
that are you getting to these like crazy questions i don't know how it went down

1862
02:48:19,320 --> 02:48:24,520
have we made updates in science in the black yeah like you watch my towns and brown documentary

1863
02:48:24,520 --> 02:48:27,880
i think it's hard to come out of it being like this stuff is fake like if you actually like

1864
02:48:27,880 --> 02:48:33,560
ingest the details it's like absolutely like i even may have to think probabilistically but

1865
02:48:33,880 --> 02:48:42,040
80% yeah yeah um and then so go back to jake barber so so going back to this uh jake barber

1866
02:48:42,040 --> 02:48:45,480
thing where they're getting these psionic assets from other countries and getting them and putting

1867
02:48:45,480 --> 02:48:51,400
them in this program using drugs and using protocols to get them to sort of summon these

1868
02:48:51,400 --> 02:48:56,200
things he's saying that they're using these people to summon these crafts did he say he had

1869
02:48:56,200 --> 02:49:03,400
any idea where they were coming from no that that was um the jake interview was simultaneously

1870
02:49:03,400 --> 02:49:09,240
felt historic and epic and he was so articulate and like such a good you know purveyor of like

1871
02:49:09,240 --> 02:49:15,240
so intelligent clearly grush yeah yeah totally and then where it was incredibly frustrating

1872
02:49:15,240 --> 02:49:19,800
even in a way that like grush grush is like can get into the theory and speculation

1873
02:49:20,840 --> 02:49:24,920
and is like a good fact finder and it felt like with jake he was just he really wanted

1874
02:49:24,920 --> 02:49:29,880
to like keep to like the core details of like what he experienced and it it made it it was a

1875
02:49:29,880 --> 02:49:34,600
little frustrating for me because i i think i'm strongest on the theory stuff and like that's

1876
02:49:34,600 --> 02:49:38,760
i always want to get into that shit right and like i understand his position to like not want to you

1877
02:49:38,760 --> 02:49:44,120
know totally go off the rails and speculate into crazy stuff and then there was uh some sort of

1878
02:49:44,120 --> 02:49:51,000
tough book hard drive that was uh held underwater in a glacier lake yep and top of a mountain

1879
02:49:51,080 --> 02:49:56,760
yep yep yep and then and he had to like retrieve that and then they were trying to like sever the

1880
02:49:56,760 --> 02:50:04,520
hidden like they were trying to like basically uh get rid of him and like like because when

1881
02:50:04,520 --> 02:50:08,360
you're when you're like sheep dipped like that and you're like you know director of operations

1882
02:50:08,360 --> 02:50:13,320
for a helicopter uh company there's so much plausible deniability your employer can just

1883
02:50:13,320 --> 02:50:17,000
be like that dude what do you tell that guy's crazy you know just like people in the public are

1884
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:22,840
now saying you know jake's crazy or whatever even if though you know all these guys with dd

1885
02:50:22,840 --> 02:50:26,920
214s and like clear history are like coming to back him up and i think he's totally legit but

1886
02:50:26,920 --> 02:50:32,680
like who's coming who's backing him up uh you know this guy don paul uh don paul bales uh

1887
02:50:32,680 --> 02:50:39,080
there's other guys that ross colthart has interviewed um so he's one uh fred baker is another

1888
02:50:39,080 --> 02:50:44,680
um john blitch i think knows him less well doesn't have like a you know as much of a history with him

1889
02:50:44,680 --> 02:50:52,120
but he's a he's a darpa guy uh who's come out and he vetted him i think on behalf of grush and some

1890
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:56,360
other people to see if he was the real deal and like he was like yeah this guy's story totally

1891
02:50:56,360 --> 02:51:02,280
comports with like the that world that i've you know come to know and research a little bit so

1892
02:51:02,280 --> 02:51:09,400
it just seems so crazy to me that they're like we on earth with our motives our military motives

1893
02:51:09,400 --> 02:51:15,320
and our financial motives are able to do something as crazy as summon something from another fucking

1894
02:51:15,320 --> 02:51:22,360
dimension and crash it yeah so we can study it it feels crazy to me too the the thing the question

1895
02:51:22,360 --> 02:51:28,440
that that begets which i think is really important that we should all question is like you hear that

1896
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:34,120
we only have i don't know 10 to 15 ufos in our possession they're in specific hangars or whatever

1897
02:51:34,120 --> 02:51:37,560
or maybe you get one you know some people say one to two crashes a year so that would be you know

1898
02:51:37,560 --> 02:51:41,960
since roswell maybe since a little before that say 120 or whatever you know whatever

1899
02:51:42,840 --> 02:51:47,400
but if you can like summon these things on command then you'd expect us to have a thousand plus

1900
02:51:47,400 --> 02:51:52,040
right if you have a thousand plus you're going to get leakage yes right so like it can't be this

1901
02:51:52,040 --> 02:51:56,440
like you put a coin in the slot machine that you know the drink comes out sort of vibe like it

1902
02:51:56,440 --> 02:52:01,160
can't just be this like extremely repeatable predictable thing right it has to be more

1903
02:52:02,120 --> 02:52:08,040
hard to you know successfully do than that and so yeah there are all these questions that the

1904
02:52:08,040 --> 02:52:12,440
interview begets that i think people should ask because i yeah i don't know the answer to them

1905
02:52:12,440 --> 02:52:18,920
yeah and they're like why like why isn't he or people he knows or even greers people being put

1906
02:52:18,920 --> 02:52:24,120
in front of congress and and testifying all their stuff yeah why are they and jake jake has said i

1907
02:52:24,120 --> 02:52:29,640
would 100 testify before congress and so that again that show of confidence i think is important

1908
02:52:29,640 --> 02:52:35,480
you know to to which look i my guess is congress has been lied to before i like i've been in like

1909
02:52:35,480 --> 02:52:41,880
rooms with congress i'm like god these guys are so they're not smart but like um but uh you know i

1910
02:52:41,880 --> 02:52:46,280
think just the fact that he's he's willing to do that i think and going under oath under you know

1911
02:52:46,280 --> 02:52:51,640
threat of perjury i think is you know a good a good display yeah um so again i think that the

1912
02:52:51,640 --> 02:52:56,680
the details are you you know everybody has to think probabilistically but i think they're

1913
02:52:57,320 --> 02:53:01,560
they're they're pretty solid and then it's like and then there are so many other questions it

1914
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:08,360
begets where it's like what yeah yeah like what you were saying about like like being afraid to

1915
02:53:08,360 --> 02:53:17,000
interact with this or try to interact try to summon it or try to somehow like do some one of

1916
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:23,800
these ce5 things that that greer talks about you know and one of the things that um i think i

1917
02:53:23,800 --> 02:53:28,840
talked about with greer was this hitchhiker effect yeah that happens where like not only can

1918
02:53:28,840 --> 02:53:33,160
people get damaged or hurt or killed by the radiation or whatever it is that these things

1919
02:53:33,160 --> 02:53:37,880
have but like there's some sort of portal that's permanently opened with you if you're able to

1920
02:53:37,880 --> 02:53:43,240
interact with this stuff or even see it to where now like you have all you have unlimited access

1921
02:53:43,240 --> 02:53:49,400
to all this crazy um paranormal stuff yeah like some of the stuff that you see a skinwalker that's

1922
02:53:49,400 --> 02:53:53,880
extremely common like everybody's yeah the skinwalker is a great example and in those

1923
02:53:53,880 --> 02:53:58,200
cases i think it was very negative because again i think if you're trying to like weaponize this

1924
02:53:58,200 --> 02:54:02,760
stuff it explains yeah these kind of hauntings where these you know aerospace practitioners

1925
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:06,760
come home and their their kids and their family get haunted by this stuff it is like they have

1926
02:54:06,760 --> 02:54:12,520
like residue lou alzondo always calls it a sticky portfolio and i think he calls it that for very

1927
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:18,760
specific reason which is like stuff gloms on to you yeah like what you know it's like you stare

1928
02:54:18,760 --> 02:54:23,240
at the abyss long enough the abyss stares back and i i think that's just a truism especially in

1929
02:54:23,240 --> 02:54:28,600
this topic and then what do you make of all like the infighting of all these people like like

1930
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:34,920
alzondo versus greer versus like yeah like you have alzondo calling greer a terrorist i think

1931
02:54:34,920 --> 02:54:40,360
right right and like you know and simultaneously these guys are all writing books going on all

1932
02:54:40,360 --> 02:54:49,560
these podcasts it's just like what it's it's it's it's weird uh and at times i see you know all the

1933
02:54:49,560 --> 02:54:55,320
infighting and i'm like i'm like tired like i i just want like more of like a normal life and like

1934
02:54:55,320 --> 02:55:00,920
why am i like covering this like it's just so ridiculous um so we used to get fatigued by it

1935
02:55:00,920 --> 02:55:09,080
it is it is i think like the meta psyop would be like you get distracted by this internal drama

1936
02:55:09,160 --> 02:55:15,160
or whatever and like a rule that i really try to adhere to is i don't go after anybody ad hominem

1937
02:55:15,160 --> 02:55:20,440
there's like a map that i have of ufo and like i should say this for the sake of your audience

1938
02:55:20,440 --> 02:55:26,760
and my audience there are people i've interviewed that i suspect have ulterior motives i don't call

1939
02:55:26,760 --> 02:55:32,440
out those ulterior motives because i'm in enough danger seeking truth and i don't want to be like

1940
02:55:32,440 --> 02:55:36,680
i don't want people like specifically coming after me because i'm like fucking with them

1941
02:55:37,240 --> 02:55:41,080
not only that but there are people with ulterior motives where like we said earlier

1942
02:55:41,640 --> 02:55:47,720
there are elements of truth to what they say and like a lot of what they people can tell the

1943
02:55:47,720 --> 02:55:51,320
truth in limited ways and have ulterior motives that's what people don't understand so you can

1944
02:55:51,320 --> 02:55:58,040
sift out valuable stuff so i think the the the best way is you know just be open friendly cool

1945
02:55:58,040 --> 02:56:03,320
with everybody you know i'm cool with you know the two guys you just mentioned i guess we're

1946
02:56:03,320 --> 02:56:06,920
i haven't met yet but like i would be cool with him you know i'm just i just try to have like an

1947
02:56:06,920 --> 02:56:13,400
open honest fun conversation and then glean out what i think is true and honestly ask rhetorical

1948
02:56:13,400 --> 02:56:18,440
if there's any untruths you ask rhetorical questions that like show on the face of it

1949
02:56:18,440 --> 02:56:22,280
that like there's something kind of going on here but like you don't have to call it out directly

1950
02:56:22,280 --> 02:56:25,800
because it's just you're just going to end up in some fucking food fight on twitter and it's going

1951
02:56:25,800 --> 02:56:28,920
to waste your time and you're not going to get close to the truth that way right you're going

1952
02:56:28,920 --> 02:56:33,800
to get distracted by like getting into it the times i feel conflicted about having that

1953
02:56:33,800 --> 02:56:39,000
predisposition is like i do think there's been like harassment of people and i see it on like

1954
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:43,640
twitter and other places and like that fucks with me because i'm like i want to like come out and

1955
02:56:43,640 --> 02:56:50,520
defend you know anybody who's been harassed just for looking into this stuff yeah and then and by

1956
02:56:50,520 --> 02:56:54,520
the way i've faced it too and there's stuff i could tell you that would like i could tell you off

1957
02:56:55,080 --> 02:57:02,120
it's fucking crazy as far as stuff that's happened come my way really yeah yeah so yeah

1958
02:57:02,680 --> 02:57:09,800
so like that that riles me up for sure wanting to defend other people but otherwise man it's

1959
02:57:09,800 --> 02:57:14,680
just like it's a it's not it's a fool's errand trying to like get you know come after somebody

1960
02:57:14,680 --> 02:57:19,960
yeah i agree you know so i just i try to stay like pretty you know switzerland-esque it seems

1961
02:57:19,960 --> 02:57:25,800
like you're the closest dude out there to this stuff like you're it seems like you have like

1962
02:57:25,800 --> 02:57:33,880
flown closer to the sun than anybody that's not good man icarus does not oh no like the people

1963
02:57:33,880 --> 02:57:38,120
you know and the circles you run in like i mean i mean i'm not even just talking about

1964
02:57:38,760 --> 02:57:44,920
working for peter teal but like being befriending grush and you know talking to all these secret

1965
02:57:44,920 --> 02:57:51,000
aerospace people and getting all this stuff like you your brain you probably got more this puzzle

1966
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:56,840
put together than most people i thank you i mean a hundred percent you have more of the puzzle

1967
02:57:56,840 --> 02:58:01,560
than most people that are like in the media doing podcasts but like even when it comes to behind the

1968
02:58:01,560 --> 02:58:07,720
scenes shit i thank you for saying that i don't know if that's a good spot to be in you that's

1969
02:58:07,720 --> 02:58:11,240
what i'm saying i'm like if i'm if i'm one of these people or if i'm one of these folks that

1970
02:58:11,240 --> 02:58:16,200
are in charge of this stuff i'm gonna be maybe trying to get to you and subvert you a hundred

1971
02:58:16,200 --> 02:58:21,320
percent i think i'm being fully tracked at all times i think every every conversation every text

1972
02:58:21,320 --> 02:58:28,280
every interaction um and uh i think they're insights that i've probably come to that have

1973
02:58:28,280 --> 02:58:34,680
been gleaned and like taken for you know profit or whatever and uh you know that's kind of weird

1974
02:58:35,400 --> 02:58:40,120
but like you gotta just uh kind of ignore it put your blinders on keep going used to get to me more

1975
02:58:40,680 --> 02:58:45,000
and now i just try to you know i think if you have pure intentions and you're just trying to

1976
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:50,920
seek truth then i think things end well for you karmically you know but yeah it's it for sure it's

1977
02:58:50,920 --> 02:58:56,840
a weird spot to to be in i think it is partially because like if somebody tells me something and

1978
02:58:56,840 --> 02:59:02,520
then they say not to say it like i i respect relationships like really like i don't if somebody

1979
02:59:02,520 --> 02:59:07,880
you know is providing a you know as a source for something like i really i don't fuck people over

1980
02:59:07,960 --> 02:59:14,520
right like and and even like i think in the microeconomics of like podcasting journalist

1981
02:59:14,520 --> 02:59:19,560
world it's like some of these people would like push their grandma in front of a moving taxi for

1982
02:59:19,560 --> 02:59:24,760
a tip you know for a story and it's like i just don't do that shit like i just i uh you know and

1983
02:59:24,760 --> 02:59:31,080
then if it that cuts against the truth i'm just not going to air it i'm not going to put it out

1984
02:59:31,080 --> 02:59:34,760
you know but i'll kind of walk away not touch the fine china and be like i kind of know what

1985
02:59:34,760 --> 02:59:40,120
you're up to but like i don't want to what would you do if the cia came to you jesse michaels we

1986
02:59:40,120 --> 02:59:44,600
needed to have a talk we're going to tell you everything we're going to give you access to

1987
02:59:44,600 --> 02:59:50,040
everything but you need to shut the fuck up or you need to just run with the stories that we gave you

1988
02:59:50,040 --> 02:59:54,680
the green light here's the thing i think national security jesse i think that's a counterfactual i

1989
02:59:54,680 --> 02:59:59,000
don't think the cia has everything i don't think right the government has everything and i realize

1990
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:03,880
this might be a you know slightly evading your question but it's like genuinely i think it's so

1991
03:00:03,880 --> 03:00:10,120
important to to emphasize for people like if this is not a file that you can just get the government

1992
03:00:10,120 --> 03:00:15,880
has tons of data that like reality is not what it seems they probably have meta material there's

1993
03:00:15,880 --> 03:00:20,840
probably some biologics there's probably you know there's a lot of stuff that where they like know

1994
03:00:20,840 --> 03:00:26,360
reality is way weirder than what the average civilian does in fact i think that you would

1995
03:00:26,360 --> 03:00:30,760
say this too the closer you get to government circles the more they're conspiratorial than the

1996
03:00:30,760 --> 03:00:35,400
average citizen like they're more conspiratorial so they know that does that mean they have like

1997
03:00:35,400 --> 03:00:41,560
an ontological worldview a map of what the aliens are what their intentions are how many races there

1998
03:00:41,560 --> 03:00:46,760
are where they're from whether they're interdimensional extraterrestrials absolutely not i think maybe you

1999
03:00:46,760 --> 03:00:52,520
get in a certain core circles and areas they have better frameworks than you know people on the

2000
03:00:52,520 --> 03:00:57,560
civil side do what if it was battelle that came to you jesse michaels we need to have a talk brother

2001
03:00:57,560 --> 03:01:03,480
we're gonna fund your podcast five million dollars a year subsidized by no way i would i would never

2002
03:01:03,480 --> 03:01:11,160
get like funded if the funding involves like steering the content like now yeah um if it's

2003
03:01:11,160 --> 03:01:16,200
like educational and like you know in in order to like tell the truth about something and there was

2004
03:01:16,200 --> 03:01:21,720
some like public private partnership i would entertain it especially if i could be open

2005
03:01:21,720 --> 03:01:25,560
to that to the public and i wasn't like lying about that yeah for sure like i don't think like

2006
03:01:25,560 --> 03:01:30,120
everybody in government's like a bad person or like right it's not a monolith right for sure um

2007
03:01:30,120 --> 03:01:35,720
but yeah no i wouldn't like i wouldn't do some like intentional limited hangout thing yeah yeah

2008
03:01:35,720 --> 03:01:39,560
it'd be it'd be an interesting bridge to cross if the opportunity ever presented itself i always

2009
03:01:39,560 --> 03:01:45,560
think about that is that your pitch nanny yeah you're like you're like just hit me up

2010
03:01:47,240 --> 03:01:53,240
that's so funny uh yeah would it matter because i mean most people online already think that

2011
03:01:53,240 --> 03:01:58,360
we're cias i know dude it's exactly half the people are like he's a spook and he's funded

2012
03:01:58,360 --> 03:02:02,280
by peter teal and blah blah blah yeah right yeah you're already you're already you got an uphill

2013
03:02:02,280 --> 03:02:07,960
battle that's an uphill battle for sure for sure and like i don't know i always just like okay don't

2014
03:02:07,960 --> 03:02:12,440
trust anything i'm saying like fine and then like the people who do like you're gonna learn a lot

2015
03:02:12,440 --> 03:02:17,800
of crazy shit because i'm revealing like really crazy shit stuff that i came to on my own and

2016
03:02:17,800 --> 03:02:24,360
honestly i've lost i've put a lot of money like like the opportunity cost involved in like study

2017
03:02:24,360 --> 03:02:30,120
like going after ufos like i i managed like nine figures of capital like i was investing a lot of

2018
03:02:30,120 --> 03:02:33,880
money in a way that would have been like really good for my future if i wanted like a chill good

2019
03:02:33,880 --> 03:02:39,480
life like i had that like set up like i easily could have kept going on the path that was going

2020
03:02:39,480 --> 03:02:45,960
on do some conventional venture fund yeah you know have fucking cocktails at happy hour in la

2021
03:02:45,960 --> 03:02:50,360
go fucking bevely hills hotel and go to like i could have done that and i and i decided to go

2022
03:02:50,360 --> 03:02:55,800
like a way more masochistic route so it's fine like you can call me whatever but like trust me

2023
03:02:55,800 --> 03:03:00,680
it's not fucking that yeah how do you have time to do the investing stuff anymore i honestly don't do

2024
03:03:00,680 --> 03:03:07,960
that much of it anymore it's like yeah it's like most of what we've done like i'm managing up on

2025
03:03:07,960 --> 03:03:11,560
you know like existing investments and just making sure they're going well and i'm like in touch with

2026
03:03:11,560 --> 03:03:16,760
the you know the fund managers that i've sourced as well as uh the companies themselves and then

2027
03:03:16,760 --> 03:03:21,240
occasionally if something jumps the bar and feels like a no-brainer i'll do a little bit of i'll do

2028
03:03:21,240 --> 03:03:24,920
diligence on like you know an early stage thing where it's more qualitative and not quantitative

2029
03:03:24,920 --> 03:03:29,320
analysis and i'll do a deal but it's like i was deploying much more money three years ago than

2030
03:03:29,320 --> 03:03:35,880
i am now so it's just slow down right what is to you what is the absolute spookiest darkest

2031
03:03:36,840 --> 03:03:42,120
sinister theory about what these things are that you've heard that you may not believe but that

2032
03:03:42,120 --> 03:03:47,080
you've heard that you think may have may have some little bit of merit like the one that you

2033
03:03:47,080 --> 03:03:53,240
don't want to be true i can't say it really yeah it's too dark yeah it's really fun you can't say

2034
03:03:53,240 --> 03:03:56,440
because you'd be betraying somebody or because you just know put it out there i don't put it out

2035
03:03:56,440 --> 03:04:02,680
there really yeah there there are well there are probably good factions that are angelic you know

2036
03:04:02,680 --> 03:04:08,280
to use a simple term and then bad factions that are demonic and then what are the demonic things

2037
03:04:08,280 --> 03:04:12,520
doing it looks like maybe they're mining our attention you know like robert monroe who studied

2038
03:04:12,520 --> 03:04:16,520
consciousness and you know um you know virginia has this institute you know that he started

2039
03:04:17,080 --> 03:04:21,320
like he had this concept of louche and so maybe there's stuff like that going on where like

2040
03:04:21,320 --> 03:04:24,600
when you're in a zombie state where does your consciousness go maybe that's sort of like a

2041
03:04:24,600 --> 03:04:30,120
mining process but then you look at like you know scapegoating cycles like pagan scapegoating cycles

2042
03:04:30,120 --> 03:04:36,760
and like i don't know you get in a weird territory and like it's hard to i don't know what the darkest

2043
03:04:36,760 --> 03:04:43,320
you know theory is but um i think the the good ones are like don't don't interfere

2044
03:04:44,280 --> 03:04:50,200
as much with you and you're more like you're ascending to their level and it's like a two-way

2045
03:04:50,200 --> 03:04:57,560
bilateral connection where like one of my favorite quotes is uh the world is full of magical things

2046
03:04:57,560 --> 03:05:03,240
patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper and it's like there's once if if you can like

2047
03:05:03,240 --> 03:05:08,600
increase your own you know kind of spiritual sense and your knowledge and you can increase

2048
03:05:08,600 --> 03:05:13,960
the purity of your intention i think you get closer to to truth around a lot of these things

2049
03:05:13,960 --> 03:05:18,920
and i think this idea this bifurcation this idea that it's just academic rote knowledge that you

2050
03:05:18,920 --> 03:05:23,960
have to learn and then this kind of you know spiritual sense like that's totally different

2051
03:05:23,960 --> 03:05:28,360
like your own you know moral development as a person yeah i think they're go hand in hand

2052
03:05:28,360 --> 03:05:32,520
and i think the more you do that the more you have synchronicities the more you get in touch

2053
03:05:32,520 --> 03:05:37,960
you feel this sort of angelic guidance in your life the more you feel protected and the and and

2054
03:05:37,960 --> 03:05:44,200
and uh and so i think whatever's good is like this kind of non-interferent initiation process

2055
03:05:44,200 --> 03:05:49,320
and then the bad stuff you know i don't know in the world in which these beings exist they're

2056
03:05:49,320 --> 03:05:53,160
probably behind a whole lot of human affairs and they're probably stoking wars and causing

2057
03:05:53,160 --> 03:05:58,920
violence and division and then you have to ask why and i don't know why right well i mean why

2058
03:05:58,920 --> 03:06:04,200
wouldn't they be like us right why wouldn't there be good versions and bad versions totally

2059
03:06:04,200 --> 03:06:09,800
totally yeah you have good and bad humans yeah yeah i i agree with that have you ever seen a ufo

2060
03:06:09,800 --> 03:06:14,840
in real life oh yeah yeah yeah really yeah i've seen more than one see that's the thing that i

2061
03:06:15,880 --> 03:06:22,280
i'm kind of like on the fence about sure because like like me and you talk about this stuff all the

2062
03:06:22,280 --> 03:06:27,320
time but i don't know if i want to have any of these experiences yeah i don't know if i want to

2063
03:06:27,320 --> 03:06:32,120
actually encounter this kind of shit in real life i don't know how it would affect me i think that's

2064
03:06:32,120 --> 03:06:37,400
totally valid and i definitely don't want to have an abduction experience like i actually get

2065
03:06:37,400 --> 03:06:42,760
everybody i interview who's had an abduction experience my buddy from yes theory amar can

2066
03:06:42,760 --> 03:06:46,920
deal who does a lot of the shows with me i make him come with me because he's like this like

2067
03:06:46,920 --> 03:06:51,560
positive energy like protective energy bubble and i'm like i get spooked i get freaked even with

2068
03:06:51,560 --> 03:06:55,800
witley i was a little freaked out dude i've never been more terrified yeah and he'll say stuff like

2069
03:06:55,800 --> 03:07:00,280
oh people he said it with you i remember he said like people who are with me sometimes have like

2070
03:07:00,280 --> 03:07:03,640
experiences and i remember you're like i was like i don't want that he's like it might happen he's

2071
03:07:03,640 --> 03:07:09,320
like absolutely it'll happen to you i'm like please no yeah okay i'll tell him not to yeah yeah yeah

2072
03:07:09,320 --> 03:07:16,120
no i i think um any jacobson when she wrote a great book the phenomenon um yes also i think

2073
03:07:16,120 --> 03:07:20,520
she was like she was talking to jock valet and she was like please like don't don't i just don't

2074
03:07:20,520 --> 03:07:25,000
want to get abducted like i'll study this stuff but yeah once you start studying this stuff you

2075
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:28,920
the second you realize like a switch in your brain goes off and you're like okay this person's not

2076
03:07:28,920 --> 03:07:34,120
crazy and they've been abducted like this stuff's actually just real then it freaks you out because

2077
03:07:34,120 --> 03:07:39,400
you're like uh-oh am i you know so i i i feel that on the abduct i don't want to get abducted man

2078
03:07:39,400 --> 03:07:44,040
no i don't want to ever see any of these things in my bedroom same same but i do think there's a

2079
03:07:44,040 --> 03:07:48,200
huge difference between that and like being inspired by some like cool craft in the sky like i

2080
03:07:48,200 --> 03:07:53,160
think yeah kind of chill yeah i think it's and for me that was like a that was like a beautiful

2081
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:56,600
like what kind of great experience what did you see exactly although i will say abduction experiences

2082
03:07:56,600 --> 03:08:02,440
i think over 50 are often described as positive so or yeah over 50 are are are positive at least

2083
03:08:02,440 --> 03:08:08,200
in the free edgar mitchell study but oh okay i saw because whitley's is a horror movie yeah i know

2084
03:08:08,200 --> 03:08:12,680
i know and a lot a lot are and a lot again if it goes back to that like droid gray thing where

2085
03:08:12,680 --> 03:08:16,600
it's like we do not fear but then they're like bleeding everywhere and they like put a little

2086
03:08:16,600 --> 03:08:24,200
thing in you and they black out and it's like oh god that doesn't sound good at all um my uh ufo

2087
03:08:24,200 --> 03:08:32,200
experience well i had i had two that like really stand out and that are one was in laurel canyon

2088
03:08:32,840 --> 03:08:39,160
and i talked about this on julian dory's podcast as well where it looked it looked like a school

2089
03:08:39,160 --> 03:08:43,960
bus or something like it was like nothing like prosaically that i ever see and so that's why

2090
03:08:44,040 --> 03:08:46,920
i'll call it a ufo i don't know you know if it could have been aerospace but it was

2091
03:08:47,640 --> 03:08:52,840
hovering above the treetops at like you know 40 50 feet it was it was going across the treetops and

2092
03:08:52,840 --> 03:09:01,480
then the uh the woman i was with she said that she saw the thing like descend down like uh across

2093
03:09:01,480 --> 03:09:07,000
the the treetops in laurel canyon i didn't see that but what i saw was like it was like this

2094
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:12,760
like kind of tesseract like rectangle shaped like school bus like thing that like i've just

2095
03:09:12,760 --> 03:09:18,280
never seen before ever and was so weird and the way it came about was also weird too because

2096
03:09:18,280 --> 03:09:23,800
aliens had just come up in our discussion so it was like one of us was like do you believe in

2097
03:09:23,800 --> 03:09:27,400
aliens and like and then at some point i was like ah yeah i'm kind of super into aliens actually

2098
03:09:27,400 --> 03:09:31,480
i think it's really interesting and then i was like i kind of i'd be interesting to meet an alien

2099
03:09:31,480 --> 03:09:37,160
and then she goes um it'll come when you least expect it and this is the weirdest part of the

2100
03:09:37,160 --> 03:09:43,400
stories we walk by a guy who's has a metal detector and it's like sun a little after sunset

2101
03:09:43,400 --> 03:09:47,720
or sunset in laurel canyon and it's like why does he have a metal detector he's like looking for

2102
03:09:47,720 --> 03:09:51,400
something and it says it'll come when you or she said it'll come when you stop looking for it and

2103
03:09:51,400 --> 03:09:55,320
he's like looking for it this is a little weird yeah and that could be again me noticing too

2104
03:09:55,320 --> 03:10:00,280
many patterns but like um then we walk and we just see this little clearing and then the thing goes

2105
03:10:00,280 --> 03:10:09,800
over what color was it it was gray metallic and uh yeah it was like seemed like i don't know it

2106
03:10:09,800 --> 03:10:14,600
wasn't making like enough noise where like the amount of weight that it was carrying like you'd

2107
03:10:14,600 --> 03:10:21,320
expect like an absurd amount of noise yeah like apache level like 10 apache level you know so

2108
03:10:21,320 --> 03:10:25,720
super super strange and it was around a time in my life where i was experiencing a lot of kind of

2109
03:10:25,720 --> 03:10:31,640
like interesting synchronicities and like things would kind of pop into you know that was when i

2110
03:10:31,640 --> 03:10:36,040
was around the time when i met diana pusulka actually and like i started to kind of take

2111
03:10:36,040 --> 03:10:40,840
take more of a dive down the down the rabbit hole and the other time i was doing holotropic

2112
03:10:40,840 --> 03:10:46,360
breath work in silver lake with a friend a friend who's i i won't out him but he's a prominent

2113
03:10:46,360 --> 03:10:52,040
investor who's like as rational as it gets like he's actually really interested in like philosophy

2114
03:10:52,040 --> 03:10:56,200
and you know academic science and stuff and like the way he described his worldview is like

2115
03:10:56,200 --> 03:11:01,560
the natural philosophers like david hume super nanome chomsky like he couldn't be more like

2116
03:11:01,560 --> 03:11:06,360
the material world is what it is like he's kind of like a material world like a materialist atheist

2117
03:11:06,360 --> 03:11:13,240
you know and we had just gone surfing and then we're back at his spot in silver lake and i want to

2118
03:11:13,240 --> 03:11:18,600
teach him holotropic breath work which is i love holotropic is the best and uh we're doing it and

2119
03:11:18,600 --> 03:11:25,000
he kind of like five minutes in like your your hands can kind of clam up it's like a common thing

2120
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:28,760
and like you get into like an interesting state and all of a sudden he looks up he's like what is

2121
03:11:28,760 --> 03:11:35,080
that oh my god two metallic or like one above him one above me they look like they're way too

2122
03:11:35,080 --> 03:11:41,000
high to be you know prosaic aircraft i i wouldn't be able to tell you like what you know 60 000 80

2123
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:48,360
000 but like they were high up and they were like bobbing like hovering and uh he go this is so funny

2124
03:11:48,600 --> 03:11:52,840
initially he goes i goes what i go what the fuck do you think those things are and he goes

2125
03:11:53,480 --> 03:11:58,040
i think those that must be one of those like deep black you know lockheed crafts or whatever

2126
03:11:58,600 --> 03:12:04,520
and i'm like interesting and then a second later he goes dude those are not like of earth

2127
03:12:05,560 --> 03:12:16,040
how long ago was this this was 2020 2020 yeah this is either that was either the um the laurel

2128
03:12:16,040 --> 03:12:22,840
canyon one was 2020 that was either 2020 or 2021 okay either late 2020 or early 2021 yeah

2129
03:12:24,120 --> 03:12:29,160
holy shit yeah yeah it's interesting the only thing i've ever seen was with chris bloodsoe

2130
03:12:29,800 --> 03:12:33,960
so you saw u of oh yeah i mean i don't think you don't think it was nothing like that it was

2131
03:12:33,960 --> 03:12:37,800
just like a ball of light okay like what he said what he the stuff that he summons and he was

2132
03:12:37,800 --> 03:12:43,000
trying to do it when you were with him yeah he was praying and do you i don't know like okay

2133
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:47,720
gun to your head you're wrong if you you know you're wrong and you die okay would you say that that

2134
03:12:47,720 --> 03:12:54,440
was like human aircraft or prosaically explained ball lightning or whatever or like some kind of

2135
03:12:54,440 --> 03:13:03,240
celestial like otherworldly thing i would say if i had a gun in my head i and my my best guess

2136
03:13:03,240 --> 03:13:09,080
yeah would be that it's some sort of natural phenomenon that happens in the atmosphere

2137
03:13:09,640 --> 03:13:14,040
that we just don't that i just don't notice because i don't stare at the sky enough yep

2138
03:13:14,040 --> 03:13:17,800
because me and steven were out there for two hours trying to find something okay praying to

2139
03:13:17,800 --> 03:13:21,480
the heavens and then we saw this thing it was definitely not an airplane yep i know it wasn't

2140
03:13:21,480 --> 03:13:25,480
an airplane what it looked like we have a video it was a it came off of the horizon it was like a

2141
03:13:25,480 --> 03:13:32,760
little ball of light came up off the horizon where the water met the the air and it came up

2142
03:13:33,400 --> 03:13:37,640
started going this way then got really really bright then got really really dim

2143
03:13:37,640 --> 03:13:41,240
and then just fizzled out so how so how would you explain that from a scientific perspective

2144
03:13:41,240 --> 03:13:45,000
i don't know yeah i don't know ball lightning something like that like a like ball lightning

2145
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:49,640
some sort of atmospheric anomaly yeah but was there anything that would you know cause ball

2146
03:13:49,640 --> 03:13:53,400
lightning i had no idea i don't know i don't know the science behind it but like if i was till the

2147
03:13:53,400 --> 03:14:00,120
i know it was not an airplane yeah yeah yeah and the way it was moving was definitely showed that

2148
03:14:00,120 --> 03:14:03,560
it wasn't an airplane because we saw airplanes that were flying there was there was airplanes

2149
03:14:03,560 --> 03:14:09,560
flying off the beach or off of the ocean on to land to land in tampa airport and they had

2150
03:14:09,560 --> 03:14:13,480
navigation lights flashing and stuff like that they were obviously following a specific flight

2151
03:14:13,480 --> 03:14:18,440
pattern and this thing was not doing that didn't have the flashing lights it got brighter dimmer

2152
03:14:18,440 --> 03:14:23,560
fizzled out to nothing came up there it is came off the atmosphere so this is the horizon of the

2153
03:14:23,560 --> 03:14:27,400
can you see the horizon down there where it's like because it's so dark it's like one more time

2154
03:14:27,960 --> 03:14:33,480
it's in north korea no this is here out here there it is oh there's something right on the water

2155
03:14:33,480 --> 03:14:40,840
right on the water thank you thank you if you could flash for us that's an airplane on the top

2156
03:14:42,200 --> 03:14:49,240
that's not uh-huh i'm getting it right there now it starts going to the right

2157
03:14:50,680 --> 03:14:56,200
it's still in here and now another one above it see yeah and it's zigzagging that one fizzles out

2158
03:14:56,200 --> 03:15:01,240
look at this one on the left look at this one look how bright it's getting wow here someone

2159
03:15:01,240 --> 03:15:08,520
needs to look through this it's very bright thank you oh you see it it's right there you see it

2160
03:15:10,600 --> 03:15:15,480
that is definitely an orb i'm tracking it here do you want to look yeah and then it fizzled out to

2161
03:15:15,480 --> 03:15:21,080
nothing let me find it yeah fade it in and fade it out they were seeing it with the naked eye i

2162
03:15:21,080 --> 03:15:27,640
didn't see it until i put in his little psionic camera thing that sees in like the dark but like

2163
03:15:27,640 --> 03:15:30,360
maybe it's something to do with that camera but i don't know also they were seeing it with their

2164
03:15:30,360 --> 03:15:34,360
naked eye uh-huh but like i don't know how do you explain that i don't know i gotta talk to somebody

2165
03:15:34,360 --> 03:15:40,760
who knows about like this stuff i mean i don't know do you see how it comes off of the horizon

2166
03:15:40,760 --> 03:15:45,080
like that though that's crazy yeah do that again steve yeah because that's is that water rewind

2167
03:15:45,080 --> 03:15:49,560
that's water yeah go to the very beginning yeah so what is the controller too so we can see the

2168
03:15:49,560 --> 03:15:56,440
horizon watch watch look at that what yeah yeah yeah yeah

2169
03:15:59,400 --> 03:16:03,560
it was so far away you know it was like how many how far away would you say that was steve

2170
03:16:04,280 --> 03:16:09,480
i think the from our vantage point the horizon is probably like three miles

2171
03:16:09,480 --> 03:16:16,280
yeah we kind of start going to the right too yeah yeah and then it kind of goes back it kind of

2172
03:16:16,280 --> 03:16:21,000
zigs it yeah like what flies like that i don't know i think there's something there's definitely

2173
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:25,880
something to what he's doing like what he's doing is absolutely i agree legit and real i don't know

2174
03:16:25,880 --> 03:16:30,440
how to explain it do you sense interesting energy when you're around him like do you just like feel

2175
03:16:30,440 --> 03:16:34,440
it like i don't know what to attribute that to i don't know whether to attribute that to whether

2176
03:16:34,440 --> 03:16:39,960
i'm i am just sort of being affected by the energy and that's just a normal thing like it's just his

2177
03:16:39,960 --> 03:16:45,160
vibe that he gives off yeah you know and it's just affecting me like affecting my soul in a way where

2178
03:16:45,160 --> 03:16:48,680
i'm like i'm in it and i'm believing it in the moment i'm like oh my god wow this is

2179
03:16:48,680 --> 03:16:56,920
fucking blowing my mind this is real what is this yeah or like like i said is this something that

2180
03:16:56,920 --> 03:17:01,080
you could just go anywhere and stare at the sky all night long and see this stuff all the time

2181
03:17:02,200 --> 03:17:08,040
that seemed anomalous to me at the very least that doesn't seem like if you were to do some like

2182
03:17:08,040 --> 03:17:13,000
meta study on like the probability of seeing that even in a two-hour period where you're staring at

2183
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:18,680
the sky extremely low yeah what is that right that's weird now i'm not saying that that's

2184
03:17:18,680 --> 03:17:24,760
definitely ufo an angel an orb i don't know but but it i think it's worthy of a investigation

2185
03:17:24,760 --> 03:17:30,120
yeah and then like detractors would say that like maybe he sets somebody up with a boat and a drone

2186
03:17:30,120 --> 03:17:35,720
outside there but like off the beach do you get that vibe from him i don't at all no like i get

2187
03:17:35,720 --> 03:17:42,040
i get you know maybe everybody in ufo world or a lot of people are credulous and high on the openness

2188
03:17:42,040 --> 03:17:47,640
scale i don't from my you know conversations with chris blood so i think he's a good person

2189
03:17:47,640 --> 03:17:52,680
me too and and and also he had no idea where we were going to dinner that night we just went to i

2190
03:17:52,680 --> 03:17:57,480
told him a random restaurant i took him to on the beach he didn't know where it was and i said or

2191
03:17:57,480 --> 03:18:00,760
afterwards i'm like you want to go to the cross of the beach and see if we can do this he's like oh

2192
03:18:00,760 --> 03:18:05,640
yeah let's do it i got my camera with me and his daughter and his wife and his his uh his his

2193
03:18:05,640 --> 03:18:10,600
daughter's wife were also there yeah and and he just did it yeah i don't think that's a hoax man

2194
03:18:10,760 --> 03:18:13,720
no it's not something going on there's something going on and the wildest thing

2195
03:18:13,720 --> 03:18:18,200
is all these people that are attaching themselves to them which is like the craziest thing crazy

2196
03:18:18,200 --> 03:18:25,320
people where if i mean dude like we're in like a cold war with china why would we be spending

2197
03:18:25,320 --> 03:18:30,280
those sorts of resources on a guy who's seeing orbs you know in north carolina outside his

2198
03:18:30,280 --> 03:18:37,080
backyard if it weren't something actually kind of profound and interesting like why right like

2199
03:18:37,160 --> 03:18:41,240
because these guys are we're not just connecting dots here like this is like legitimate stuff

2200
03:18:41,240 --> 03:18:45,880
yeah yeah like this stuff is all documented that the people that are that are visiting him and

2201
03:18:45,880 --> 03:18:51,560
befriending him yeah jim semivan is like very well respected at the cia yes he's like pretty

2202
03:18:51,560 --> 03:18:56,760
i think high up and like he spent a lot of time with chris bloodsoe yeah i think they're good

2203
03:18:56,760 --> 03:19:03,720
friends yeah so yeah it's interesting that combined with the fact that that video is completely

2204
03:19:03,720 --> 03:19:09,080
went unsearchable in one in an instant that's wild on youtube that's weird and we're like i was

2205
03:19:09,080 --> 03:19:12,280
good like after that thing dropped i would go every day you probably do this where you just i

2206
03:19:12,280 --> 03:19:16,200
searched chris bloodsoe on youtube every day yeah for like the first week just to see where it was

2207
03:19:16,200 --> 03:19:21,880
ranking right it was top for the first week the day it dropped you couldn't find it you would

2208
03:19:21,880 --> 03:19:27,720
you could go a thousand pages deep and never find it it was just it was just four or five or six

2209
03:19:29,080 --> 03:19:32,840
history channel videos of him with on the history channel you want to know something funny

2210
03:19:32,840 --> 03:19:37,560
you could type in david grush to this day i'm not to toot my own horn but the video i did with him

2211
03:19:37,560 --> 03:19:44,120
is the best video that he has oh i agree and like you can't find it you could type in david grush

2212
03:19:44,120 --> 03:19:50,840
on youtube and it's news nation rogan a bunch of other things and it's my thing is unsearchable

2213
03:19:50,840 --> 03:19:57,640
and in five days or six days got well over two million views and then it just got throttled

2214
03:19:58,200 --> 03:20:03,000
and and everybody i mean i'm working with yes theory on it they have nine million subscribers

2215
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:07,240
on youtube and i'm showing them the stats like the click through rate and average view duration

2216
03:20:07,240 --> 03:20:11,560
they're like we've never seen anything this high like what like what the fuck and like you watch it

2217
03:20:11,560 --> 03:20:15,400
and it's like very watchable yeah and it's just here we're going through right now it's like we're

2218
03:20:15,400 --> 03:20:25,480
searching david uh with the c is that it yeah but go to dave david uh grush have you seen it before

2219
03:20:26,360 --> 03:20:35,880
uh i don't know search go down look there it is bro that looks good we're back baby it definitely

2220
03:20:35,880 --> 03:20:40,920
was it and like i have an email chain with google about where it wasn't so like here's what i have

2221
03:20:40,920 --> 03:20:44,760
the receipts that it was unsearchable this happened to my whitley streber episode too only for the

2222
03:20:44,760 --> 03:20:49,960
first two weeks okay after the first two weeks they put it back well also go on incognito i do

2223
03:20:49,960 --> 03:20:54,040
want to see if it's the same because you open up a new because you've seen the video open up an

2224
03:20:54,040 --> 03:20:58,280
incognito browser yeah a new private window yeah whatever but you're saying that it can get off

2225
03:20:58,280 --> 03:21:04,120
get off brave get off brave go to go to chrome yeah sometimes what they'll do is they'll make

2226
03:21:04,120 --> 03:21:07,480
it invisible on search for the first two weeks when it's going to get shared the most and go

2227
03:21:07,480 --> 03:21:12,280
viral catch traction the most after the first two weeks you're already posted your next video

2228
03:21:12,280 --> 03:21:17,640
then they'll put it back so they can plausibly deny the fact that okay so we're good now we're

2229
03:21:17,640 --> 03:21:20,440
number two now type in chris bledsoe yeah let's do that

2230
03:21:22,840 --> 03:21:29,880

2234
03:21:44,280 --> 03:21:49,400
full podcast on his channel with him reacting to it that was popping up what yeah oh shoot it's

2235
03:21:49,400 --> 03:21:53,080
really good yeah that was the same with the grush thing for me originally it was like all these like

2236
03:21:53,640 --> 03:21:59,960
like analysis of the video videos were ranking high it's now now go back to the top steve nuts

2237
03:21:59,960 --> 03:22:04,680
man and yeah yours was like the first big one go back to the scroll of the very top it's still the

2238
03:22:04,680 --> 03:22:08,840
most viewed i'm pretty sure go to the and get out of the search thing see where it says filters on

2239
03:22:08,840 --> 03:22:15,000
the far right yeah filtered by most viewed yeah it's probably yours top top no yeah right view

2240
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:23,960
count yeah view count 3.9 yeah no that's you yeah yeah nasa's forbidden alien wow holy crap wow wow

2241
03:22:25,640 --> 03:22:30,200
that's wild man and you have in your tags and stuff you have like of course yeah no like i said it

2242
03:22:30,200 --> 03:22:34,760
was the number one search result for the first something like two weeks that's so it's crazy to

2243
03:22:34,760 --> 03:22:41,800
see mine number two yeah right well dude i i swear to god no i know the guy youtube literally

2244
03:22:41,800 --> 03:22:46,360
told me this yeah he told you that exactly that mine was like fell off a cliff views wise yeah

2245
03:22:46,360 --> 03:22:51,240
and it went completely invisible went completely invisible yeah and then yes theories they say okay

2246
03:22:51,240 --> 03:22:57,080
this is crazy yes theories they say it's the best stats they have on any video and it's one of their

2247
03:22:57,080 --> 03:23:03,480
lower it's like in the lower 25 viewed videos it only has 1.1 million views which for them is

2248
03:23:03,720 --> 03:23:09,160
2.1.2 or 1.1 million views which for them is extremely low like they have crazy crazy high

2249
03:23:09,160 --> 03:23:15,240
viewed stuff yeah and the stats are like off the charts so like they're also like super

2250
03:23:15,240 --> 03:23:21,640
conspiratorial about them and they're like the most like kid-friendly do-gooder like they're

2251
03:23:21,640 --> 03:23:25,240
like the best vibes like they're not and like they're not breaking rules they're not breaking

2252
03:23:25,240 --> 03:23:28,760
rules and like when they're like yeah we're getting throttled like i'm like oh yeah

2253
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:36,520
yeah people some people are are speculating that the uh the trump thing is gonna do like some sort

2254
03:23:36,520 --> 03:23:41,000
of a trust bust on youtube and and force them to stop regulating this stuff so much and stomping

2255
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:47,800
on content well dude trump made that like misinformation is bullshit like you know it's

2256
03:23:47,800 --> 03:23:52,040
like this like speech or whatever like right when he got elected i loved it to me i

2257
03:23:52,840 --> 03:23:59,480
misinformation is so condescending yes who is the arbiter of misinformation like why are you

2258
03:23:59,480 --> 03:24:06,760
why do you decide you're so wrong you've proven to be so incompetent in the context of the pandemic

2259
03:24:06,760 --> 03:24:11,800
and covid yeah and all these other things like the history of american false flags why are you the

2260
03:24:11,800 --> 03:24:18,920
arbiter well like why bbc trusted news initiative cnn you can say what is misinformation you don't

2261
03:24:18,920 --> 03:24:24,440
think for yourself like it's ridiculous so let everything out and let people decide yeah let

2262
03:24:24,440 --> 03:24:30,040
people decide what they think is bullshit and what they think is real yeah no the the um the

2263
03:24:30,040 --> 03:24:34,360
mike ben stuff really illuminates all that disinformation misinformation stuff and how

2264
03:24:34,360 --> 03:24:38,360
they go to like other countries and like force them to regulate stuff and they basically hold

2265
03:24:38,360 --> 03:24:43,960
the corporations like they pit them against like maintaining their monopolies overseas like okay

2266
03:24:43,960 --> 03:24:47,960
well if you're gonna if you're gonna censor this stuff we'll let you keep your monopoly in europe

2267
03:24:47,960 --> 03:24:53,240
right like dude that stuff is crazy it's crazy and speaking of the that in the context of the ufo

2268
03:24:53,240 --> 03:25:00,600
topic i should say the usaid funded the intercept we know that for sure ken clippenstein

2269
03:25:02,600 --> 03:25:11,160
came out with basically leaked dave grush's uh medical records and uh and that is what like

2270
03:25:11,160 --> 03:25:15,640
kind of marginalized grush for a for a while i mean i think most people don't really like realize

2271
03:25:15,640 --> 03:25:20,760
it's bullshit i mean the dude like it was an afghanistan combat veteran was deployed and like

2272
03:25:20,760 --> 03:25:24,920
his buddy like died next to him was like mortared and stuff like it's just fucked up like it and

2273
03:25:24,920 --> 03:25:30,520
that's what they're in like so like you know when he would drink occasionally he would like go

2274
03:25:30,520 --> 03:25:36,040
through that he would resimulate those feelings for him and ken clippenstein who's working for

2275
03:25:36,040 --> 03:25:42,920
a usaid funded publication is leaking these medical records right after grush testifies

2276
03:25:42,920 --> 03:25:48,280
before congress to discredit him it's just weird man yeah that is super fucking feels really

2277
03:25:48,280 --> 03:25:59,480
coordinated god man yeah the usaid thing is like such a nuclear bomb for the for the government

2278
03:25:59,480 --> 03:26:04,920
yeah like that that stuff is just bananas and how it's like you can't escape it it's too big it's

2279
03:26:04,920 --> 03:26:10,600
too big to to squash we've just been living in managed reality yeah for decades yeah yeah yeah

2280
03:26:10,600 --> 03:26:15,240
spending spending two billion or how many billions of dollars on on trans operas in

2281
03:26:15,240 --> 03:26:20,680
the ukraine and like all this stupid stuff they're funding everywhere like yeah god damn ian carroll

2282
03:26:20,680 --> 03:26:24,840
has been doing a great job of talking about this stuff this he does like crazy deep dives on us

2283
03:26:24,840 --> 03:26:30,520
aid and all this stuff he's awesome yeah he's dope have you have you um are you familiar with

2284
03:26:30,520 --> 03:26:36,760
like the history of google and serguey brin and like google being incubated by the cia and nsa

2285
03:26:36,840 --> 03:26:44,840
you were telling me some stuff here i mean i know that uh men x right was like the darpa

2286
03:26:44,840 --> 03:26:51,320
search engine that kind of dovetailed with google but otherwise i don't you tell me yeah so no

2287
03:26:51,320 --> 03:26:55,400
there's a um i don't know much about it other than this like crazy article i read on it recently

2288
03:26:55,400 --> 03:27:00,520
about this guy forget the guy's named uh it was on substack i think and he wrote um he did like a

2289
03:27:00,520 --> 03:27:09,240
super deep dive and it's all connected to um serguey at stanford was and the guy that he was

2290
03:27:09,240 --> 03:27:18,200
working under were literally funded and visited the whole time and incubated by cia and nsa people

2291
03:27:18,200 --> 03:27:22,360
that were visiting him and like checking in on him with the search with the page rank system

2292
03:27:22,360 --> 03:27:26,760
and all this stuff and giving him stuff that was created by darpa like it's all connected to darpa

2293
03:27:26,760 --> 03:27:34,680
and saic and like all this crazy military industrial complex stuff i say i see was

2294
03:27:34,680 --> 03:27:42,760
you know based in palo alto yeah yeah so like it's a it's so like it basically where did you

2295
03:27:42,760 --> 03:27:47,960
learn all this from these from the stuff that i read wow and it's it the implications of it is

2296
03:27:47,960 --> 03:27:55,640
that google was quite literally funded and created by the cia and darpa so what does that even mean

2297
03:27:55,640 --> 03:28:00,520
like how do you like well you know you know like oracles first contract was with the cia yes and

2298
03:28:00,520 --> 03:28:05,640
like i do think a lot of this stuff gets created in the black right well so it's palant here too

2299
03:28:05,640 --> 03:28:11,480
right like palant like like like i understand that i understand why you would want to create companies

2300
03:28:11,480 --> 03:28:16,360
that you're you're literally you're you're doing it in reverse instead of creating a company and

2301
03:28:16,360 --> 03:28:22,840
finding clients you're you're finding a hole or you're finding a need that the government has

2302
03:28:22,840 --> 03:28:28,200
a government who has billions of dollars in in resources to invest in this stuff find a way to

2303
03:28:28,200 --> 03:28:31,880
do it better and you're basically creating a company that already has a built-in client

2304
03:28:31,880 --> 03:28:35,640
the u.s government which is like essentially what palantir is right or what elon's doing with space

2305
03:28:35,640 --> 03:28:39,800
i think it's what it ended up becoming i think originally it was like around like some of the

2306
03:28:39,800 --> 03:28:44,600
fraud detection stuff they were doing at paypal or whatever dovetailed with the software for

2307
03:28:44,600 --> 03:28:51,240
palantir and then i think the cia became one of the first customers right um but i don't think

2308
03:28:51,240 --> 03:28:57,080
it was created in in conjunction with right but i'm just saying if it was me and i was if i was

2309
03:28:57,080 --> 03:29:01,320
one of these guys that was creating one of these crazy companies right that was doing surveillance

2310
03:29:01,320 --> 03:29:07,320
and and whatever the hell it does like i would say we have a huge opportunity to make millions

2311
03:29:07,320 --> 03:29:10,600
of dollars off the government doing this stuff because we can do it better than they can do it

2312
03:29:10,600 --> 03:29:14,520
right i think if you've even had guys in here like andrew bustamante who have literally said

2313
03:29:14,520 --> 03:29:18,360
palantir is way better than all the stuff that we have at cia like we use palantir

2314
03:29:18,600 --> 03:29:24,280
like it's it's it works way better right right so like right it's a great business proposition

2315
03:29:24,280 --> 03:29:31,640
yeah to create a company like that yeah but like find out who wrote that article about um google

2316
03:29:32,680 --> 03:29:40,280
i think the i think the title of it was um how google how google made or no no it was how the

2317
03:29:40,280 --> 03:29:45,720
cia created google interesting and it's on sub stack i want to give this guy credit there's um

2318
03:29:46,520 --> 03:29:52,680
while you're looking that up there was a project at darpa called life log and it was like you know

2319
03:29:52,680 --> 03:29:59,720
like networking all these people and like their friends and like their friend networks and i think

2320
03:29:59,720 --> 03:30:04,760
it was shut down in 2003 or four right before facebook started so i do find that kind of

2321
03:30:04,760 --> 03:30:09,320
interesting too but i don't i have again i have no idea if there's a connection there yeah but it is

2322
03:30:09,320 --> 03:30:14,360
no this isn't it steve it's uh you don't have to type in um did you type in sub stack after oh yeah

2323
03:30:14,360 --> 03:30:20,280
you did keep going uh i mean medium medium that's it right there yeah that's it i'm sorry i messed

2324
03:30:20,280 --> 03:30:25,320
up this is it oh you can close that close that bottom thing and you'll be able to see who it's

2325
03:30:25,320 --> 03:30:36,520
by at least credit the author how the cia made google by naf nafis ahmed ahmed nafis ahmed dude

2326
03:30:36,520 --> 03:30:42,040
this is mind-blowing it's a two it's a two uh there's two articles like a series of them

2327
03:30:42,040 --> 03:30:47,960
i can't wait to read this but it's great man interesting blew my mind wow well i always found

2328
03:30:47,960 --> 03:30:52,200
it interesting like they were kind of i mean it makes total sense especially with the snowden

2329
03:30:52,200 --> 03:30:58,600
stuff in 2013 like prison bull run all that stuff came out and it's clear that the nsa just had like

2330
03:30:58,600 --> 03:31:03,880
backdoors into like all of these big tech companies and then they had they the nsa had a program i

2331
03:31:03,880 --> 03:31:09,160
think at the time called heartbeat which is like you can like basically query anybody's you know

2332
03:31:09,240 --> 03:31:14,600
data or whatever like in like this like centralized database repository so yeah we know that that was

2333
03:31:14,600 --> 03:31:19,880
a thing at the at the very least but i found it interesting when google like uh as part of

2334
03:31:19,880 --> 03:31:24,920
project maven like wouldn't work with the u.s government and then simultaneously they were

2335
03:31:24,920 --> 03:31:31,000
going into china like that same year and so there's like something i'm like how coordinated is this

2336
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:36,440
stuff and if it is coordinated you know is it are you talking about the thing where recently

2337
03:31:36,440 --> 03:31:39,880
right where google came out publicly and said that we're not going to work with the government

2338
03:31:39,880 --> 03:31:44,760
u.s government to to it was some sort of like a part of some war they basically came out

2339
03:31:44,760 --> 03:31:52,920
publicly 2017 okay yeah 2017 2018 yeah this was like a big public thing that interesting interesting

2340
03:31:52,920 --> 03:31:59,560
well they were the biggest donors to kamala number one donor yeah man corporate donors so yeah dude

2341
03:31:59,560 --> 03:32:04,920
yeah so it's funny like we both you know are so dependent on youtube and i do i'm like it does

2342
03:32:04,920 --> 03:32:10,680
make me occasionally nervous because it's like it does i'm grateful to elon musk man so as you know

2343
03:32:10,680 --> 03:32:17,480
who else was a huge donor to kamala was um what's his name alex carp you know who that is now alex

2344
03:32:17,480 --> 03:32:23,080
carp was the ceo of palantir of palantir yeah that's really interesting really interesting that

2345
03:32:23,080 --> 03:32:27,320
i didn't i wouldn't suspect that he i mean i read that i read there's a new york times piece that

2346
03:32:27,320 --> 03:32:31,800
came out on him really recently that's fast when they're interviewing him about this stuff and he's

2347
03:32:31,800 --> 03:32:37,080
like he donated to kamala yeah he was literally saying in there how he donated millions of dollars

2348
03:32:37,080 --> 03:32:45,800
to um the democrat the democratic party and um he's always described himself as a like left-wing

2349
03:32:45,800 --> 03:32:51,560
guy right yeah he's like super into hagel and like you know very like a almost like a neo-marxist

2350
03:32:51,560 --> 03:32:55,800
or something yeah but then but then it's also peter right they're like really good friends like

2351
03:32:55,800 --> 03:32:59,480
they've known each other forever since college from back in the day yeah that's stanford law i

2352
03:32:59,480 --> 03:33:06,600
believe yeah yeah um yeah so but he's also like he doesn't have any any sort of hesitation in

2353
03:33:07,400 --> 03:33:14,760
in working with the u.s government to advanced american supremacy yeah i think they're like

2354
03:33:15,400 --> 03:33:20,200
mission in many ways just like they they want to protect the free world yeah and uh you know i

2355
03:33:20,200 --> 03:33:27,480
think they are responsible for a lot of uh you know big threats to the u.s uh you know going down

2356
03:33:27,480 --> 03:33:32,840
and i think that's a pretty good thing yeah um yeah i know i know there are a lot of conspiracies

2357
03:33:32,840 --> 03:33:38,200
about them oh there's so many conspiracies bro they're mostly and that's what the other

2358
03:33:38,200 --> 03:33:42,280
people don't understand it's like for me they're mostly a black box like i don't really like

2359
03:33:42,280 --> 03:33:47,960
right interact with right right right too much but yeah yeah i mean i've met like have you heard of

2360
03:33:47,960 --> 03:33:54,040
whitney webb oh yeah yeah she goes deep on the i know on the peter teal stuff she's like dude

2361
03:33:54,040 --> 03:33:59,320
she like frustrates me because she's clearly really smart and showing a ton of courage

2362
03:33:59,320 --> 03:34:04,600
yeah like going deeper on like epstein networks than like anybody else which is epic and then

2363
03:34:05,880 --> 03:34:10,600
now she's like and now it's all you know peter and and palantir whatever it's like

2364
03:34:10,600 --> 03:34:15,560
no it's not and your book is so convoluted it's almost like if you wanted a psyop to throw people

2365
03:34:15,560 --> 03:34:20,280
off the trail for epstein it would be that book like it's so complicated and again i don't want

2366
03:34:20,280 --> 03:34:25,560
to like it's it's an it's an amazing i haven't read it yet i've tried to read it okay and it um

2367
03:34:25,560 --> 03:34:29,560
and it does she makes all sorts of amazing connections it's like a thousand pages long

2368
03:34:29,560 --> 03:34:35,640
yeah it's crazy yeah and she's she's doing an amazing service i think and uh so like very

2369
03:34:35,640 --> 03:34:42,600
net positive whitney webb but like there's certain areas where like it feels like she's just anti like

2370
03:34:42,600 --> 03:34:49,320
anybody who's rich and powerful like anybody like she's anti elon you know with all the stuff he's

2371
03:34:49,320 --> 03:34:54,280
doing around free speech right and the usaid and reading them out of our institutions like who do

2372
03:34:54,280 --> 03:34:58,600
you want to do that you need somebody that powerful to do that yes so who's like ultimately like

2373
03:34:59,560 --> 03:35:03,720
politics like is where like the battleground takes place and like it's a power game

2374
03:35:03,720 --> 03:35:07,640
and you need the people with who are the most powerful like who probably made certain

2375
03:35:07,640 --> 03:35:13,640
expedient alliances to get to where they are yeah like doing things to like get anything done

2376
03:35:13,640 --> 03:35:20,040
and i feel like she's super like if you if you are not yes so cynical and if you are not like

2377
03:35:20,040 --> 03:35:24,600
you don't pass some like crazy purity litmus test you are the devil or whatever and like

2378
03:35:24,600 --> 03:35:28,840
i would just say like look yeah like maybe everybody at the elite strata or whatever has

2379
03:35:28,840 --> 03:35:35,240
like you know had to you know at times make unholy alliances right but like whose side are you on and

2380
03:35:35,240 --> 03:35:40,840
i think i think like some real good is being done in this like new trump admin and with with elon

2381
03:35:40,840 --> 03:35:47,720
and tulsi and like tulsi and rfk like i mean yeah those those two specifically like really

2382
03:35:48,520 --> 03:35:53,000
i think were on the side of truth when it was unpopular specifically rfk jr i mean i love that

2383
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:58,120
guy i think is epic yeah um so yeah i mean i'm a fan of whitney webs but i do think she could just

2384
03:35:58,120 --> 03:36:04,360
be so like ideologically purist at times totally um but yeah i'm glad she exists yeah yeah she's

2385
03:36:04,360 --> 03:36:08,760
definitely she definitely does good work but like yeah that stuff gets the rabbit holes are never

2386
03:36:08,760 --> 03:36:12,200
ending when it comes to that stuff if you don't like you know you have to follow like it's not

2387
03:36:12,200 --> 03:36:18,120
just it's not black and white right like you can't just i guess you can you can you can shred anybody

2388
03:36:18,120 --> 03:36:23,000
you want for anything and find out every bad thing that somebody has done anybody recognize like the

2389
03:36:23,000 --> 03:36:27,800
net positive that people are doing as well 100 anybody at a certain level of power unless it's

2390
03:36:27,800 --> 03:36:34,680
like the cirque du soleil dude who like was like you know started from like with a homeless troop

2391
03:36:34,680 --> 03:36:39,240
of circus people or like the patagonia founder like occasionally you'll meet somebody where it's

2392
03:36:39,240 --> 03:36:46,760
like you got nothing exactly but like anybody in the elite world of business politics government

2393
03:36:46,760 --> 03:36:52,040
yeah i'm sorry i can't name too many people where it's like there aren't certain things that you

2394
03:36:52,040 --> 03:36:58,040
you know had to do you know and so it's it's it's a human nature it is it is unfortunately there's

2395
03:36:58,040 --> 03:37:02,440
a political game that has to be played to get shit done in washington yeah you have to play that

2396
03:37:02,440 --> 03:37:05,960
fucking game there's no way around totally and i i don't want to fucking do i mean i don't want

2397
03:37:05,960 --> 03:37:11,080
to do it either yeah fuck no it's that being in politics now like i grew up actually being like

2398
03:37:11,080 --> 03:37:15,000
maybe i'd want to be in public when i was really little maybe i'm interested in politics it'd be

2399
03:37:15,000 --> 03:37:22,360
cool and then now i'm like it's a selector for the worst people just the worst like just sell outs

2400
03:37:22,360 --> 03:37:29,000
like just spineless but the people who are just obsessed with optics yeah and uh yeah it sucks
