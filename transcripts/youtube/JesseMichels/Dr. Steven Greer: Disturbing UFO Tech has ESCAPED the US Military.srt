1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,900
It's crazy whenever I hear people like you speak about this topic because especially

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:20,740
you, you've been doing this for a long time, you've been around the block and you make

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,460
some wild claims.

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,980
No, I don't make claims.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,220
I make statements based on facts and research.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,220
I'm a scientist.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,320
You say some things that are mind blowing and it seems like you have a lot of access

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,440
to a lot of crazy dark shit and whenever you hear people say that in today's day and age,

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,880
a lot of them are full of shit.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,920
A lot of it is, we've sort of reached a breakout point.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,040
There are a group of people from a few black sites, very highly classified operations with

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:58,340
Aerospace and JSOC, Joint Special Operations Command, who have started coming forward

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,340
that I've been working with for a couple of years and they're beginning to put their

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,500
toe in the water and put some information out and these are guys who've been on the

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,780
crash retrieval teams and they've been working with me clandestinely for about 18 months

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,940
I think, something like that, or 20 months and that team is just starting to come out

17
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:25,360
with a little bit of information but they have an enormous amount more and what they're

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,540
trying to do is get the U.S. government to finally set up the protective mechanisms so

19
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,880
a whole bunch of these high value targets, HVT whistle blowers, can come forward.

20
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,880
So we've been working to set that up through a series of briefings that I've been doing

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,980
for about three years with Senate Intelligence Committee and Senate Armed Services and taking

22
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,980
some of the witnesses.

23
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:57,520
Now remember I have debriefed nearly a thousand top secret guys and in our archive, you can

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:06,180
go to dpiarchive.com, there's about 760-some named, now only 115 you can see their testimony

25
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,260
but we have 115 you can go look at right now.

26
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,100
The others are blackened out because they don't want to be known but we're handing them

27
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:21,580
over to a special access project to look into what they know, the documents they have,

28
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,720
the materials they've seen and try to put together the puzzle.

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,740
So what I liken this to, I call it the disclosure mosaic.

30
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:39,700
So imagine you have a big picture you're trying to create and because of the highly compartmented

31
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,660
nature of top secret special compartment information projects dealing with this, you get a piece

32
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,820
here and a piece here and a piece here.

33
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,580
So what I've tried to do over the past 35 years since 1990 when I started this effort

34
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:01,100
is to put together the mechanism for people to come forward, give us information and testimony,

35
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,580
whistle blower testimony, documents when they can get them out of a secure facility and

36
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,200
then put that whole assessment.

37
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:15,920
So it's called an intelligence assessment and what I discovered back about between 1990

38
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,240
and 95 is that the vast majority of information on the subject is actually very carefully

39
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:28,640
curated disinformation, if I can be blunt it's bullshit and that's been done deliberately

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:37,000
to gaslight the public and Washington officials and the media but it's also been done to create

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,980
the specter of a threat from outer space.

42
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,500
So what you know, Werner von Braun who invented the rocket for Adolf Hitler told his assistant

43
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,000
right before he died who's on our team, Carol Rosin, he said look what we're planning to

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,380
do is to launch a fake alien threat so the world can be united around some sort of dystopian

45
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,100
militaristic totalitarian state and we're real close to that.

46
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,940
I mean a warm up for that was 9-11, a bigger warm up was COVID.

47
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,400
The big one is this and if it's not averted it'll panic the planet into this stupidity.

48
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,480
So you know and this sort of false flag operation has been run since for thousands of years

49
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,900
by powerful people and military people to sort of get their way and rule through fear

50
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,860
and so what you're doing with this is that when you look at the whole body of everything

51
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:34,620
I call the legacy ufology crowd, there's good information out there and then it's

52
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,660
mixed in with nine parts of nonsense and so what most people do and this is why I've

53
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,180
been by 94 I was ready to give up on this, let me be honest with you, most government

54
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:53,220
officials go I'm out because this is such a cacophony, it's such a mixture of fact and

55
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,220
fiction and rumors upon rumors upon rumors, they don't have time for it, I'm an emergency

56
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,980
right so I'm going this is you know crazy stuff so but I've stuck with it to try to

57
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,260
make my way through this vast amount of noise.

58
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,220
That's what I was trying to express to you kind of right before we started was that I've

59
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,900
had so many folks on here talking about this topic from authors to firsthand experiencers,

60
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,040
people that have been tried to be whistleblowers to filmmakers who have talked to all these

61
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,480
witnesses and whistleblowers and all these folks and it's just like this crazy cauldron

62
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:36,800
of disinformation, misinformation, different partitions of the government fighting against

63
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,080
each other and then you have you know just like the strategic deception that goes a lot

64
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,520
it's been going on since the cold war and it's just like I've literally just been out

65
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,320
on the UFO topic for the last probably like almost a year I've just been sick of it because

66
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,760
so much of it is bull and I don't know if you've ever seen that documentary I'm sure

67
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:03,160
you have Mirage Men about Richard Doty and how the Paul Benowitz thing that has been

68
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,680
my basically that I've been looking at this whole topic through that lens for since I

69
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,480
saw that about a year ago and it's it seems like as you were alluding to it seems like

70
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:19,160
that is the predominant it seems like that is about 80% of the information that's coming

71
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:27,920
out is like specifically curated there's like counterintelligence disinformation to poison

72
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,120
the well of information on this topic. But let's unpack that why? So if you look

73
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,720
in our archive we have a top-secret document that was I believe accidentally declassified

74
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:45,720
from Canada in the 1970s it's called the Wilbur Smith document and it's a top-secret document

75
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:53,440
that is from 1950 describing the US-based reverse engineering research projects on

76
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,120
extraterrestrial vehicles that were retrieved in the 40s and it's an authenticated document

77
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,240
and it says a few things number one it says quote flying saucers are real that's what they used

78
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,160
to be called before they made up the fake name UFO UAP those were made up I hate how everyone's

79
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,320
calling it NHI all of a sudden oh yeah that's we'll get into this it's the CIA psychological

80
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,720
warfare division that has the linguistics department yeah all right look I started

81
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,680
briefing the director of the CIA in 1993 I know you did you brought you brought the briefing for

82
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,840
Trump in today right here right here so look at this big stack of documents we got here can you

83
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,840
see that Steve on the camera yeah oh well I mean it is what it is so the big problem became once

84
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,080
they realized what they had right mm-hmm and people were seeing these things because once

85
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,000
we started detonating atomic bombs and then the thermonuclear weapons these civilizations

86
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,760
from out there came in you know like it was like a homing signal and here's why when you

87
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,360
detonate an atomic weapon or a thermonuclear weapon which a hydrogen bomb right a fusion

88
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,920
bomb as opposed to fission what you get is an electromagnetic pulse but embedded in that is

89
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,880
what's called a scalar signal it like Tesla talked about and that is not a wave form like a sine

90
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,360
wave it's a point that goes out in a straight line at multiples of the speed of light it disrupts

91
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,760
interstellar communications and transport so there was it was a bit like kicking a hornet's nest

92
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,880
right because not that they were hostile towards us but they were concerned like what is going on

93
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,360
in this little corner of the cosmos so that was the whole modern era of these although they've

94
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,000
been seen for thousands of years but once we got to the nuclear threshold we crossed the Rubicon

95
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,680
here all right a red line went over and so this is why they're seen all over the place near nuclear

96
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,000
installations and nuclear ships that are carrying that are big carriers that have nuclear weapons

97
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,880
on them yeah I know many officers who had these craft around them checking that out even nuclear

98
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,560
power plants so there's a big danger with that nuclear system and how it pertains to not only

99
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,280
the future of the earth which they have an interest in these these civilizations the ET

100
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:11,600
ones but they also are concerned about what happens when a civilization or a level of social

101
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,880
and spiritual development which ain't great has these kind of technologies and start going out

102
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:24,600
in the space so it coincided shortly within 10 15 years of detonating the first atomic bomb in

103
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,560
1945 by 1957 the Soviets had put Sputnik up right and so we were they knew that we were

104
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,840
coming to be outward looking going into space why do you think these beings are invested in

105
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,400
the future of the earth if they're not from here and they're from another like if we found

106
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,320
another earth if we found if we found another planet inhabitable with life and we were way

107
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,120
more advanced than we then then they were right why would we want to protect them from themselves

108
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:55,920
well I think that what I have found is people evolve I mean let's just say whether you want

109
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:03,920
to call it spiritual or or socially psychologically you develop compassion you develop empathy you

110
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,760
develop a longer range vision than the next quarterly report right in other words you have

111
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,360
a view so you get take on a long-range view and I think those civilizations some of them may

112
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,560
have come our way before and faced near extinction level events or they've seen other civilizations

113
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,000
come and go that have you know blown themselves up or become a problem right so I don't I think

114
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,400
there's a big let's call it cosmic institutional memory out there and there's nothing new under

115
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:42,920
the Sun's this has probably happened before but I also think they see the goodness in humanity the

116
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:51,400
capacity for creativity or exploration for intelligence even very high levels of spiritual

117
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:58,440
consciousness so I it's it's not as if they view us all as so dimly I think they see the promise

118
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,400
but they see right now this little window of time in the last hundred years or so where we're on the

119
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:11,240
one hand technologically advanced enough to destroy ourselves and I'll get to this in a moment

120
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,800
potentially threaten other worlds with technologies that we've developed from reverse

121
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:23,320
engineering extraterrestrial transport systems but we're also not socially and spiritually evolved

122
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:30,280
enough to not blow ourselves to smithereens so that is exactly the sweet spot or let's call it

123
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:37,720
the the dangerous spot of where a civilization could go sideways very badly right all right and

124
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,160
we're there we've been there since you know the mid 20th century do you think there's any chance

125
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,160
that these things are or what do you make of the theory that these are future humans well I think

126
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,880
there have been some encounters that are our descendants from the future so I think we have

127
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:02,040
to be careful here I think of this let's say a species evolves for half a million years and

128
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:09,080
becomes spacefaring evolution doesn't stand still and so they could evolve to something that would

129
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:17,400
look like a non-human being an extraterrestrial being but have been descended but 20 000 generations

130
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,440
ago right and certainly that's possible I think that that's probably what happened at rundlesham

131
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,600
forest spent waters from the you mean 20 000 generations in the future yes from 500 000 years

132
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:35,400
in the future and from the some of the military guys who are there where this object landed

133
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,720
in 19 early 80s in england there's pretty good indication that there was some contact that

134
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,480
happened it was psionic telepathic that they were us from half a million years in the future

135
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:56,120
and it was a pyramid shaped onyx looking black like black onyx looking object very well documented

136
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,640
but the eventually a ministry defense in the united kingdom I went over there and met with

137
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:09,480
them back in 93 and shortly after that they did declassify some of their information on it so my

138
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,960
understanding that might have been but still in the sense they were extraterrestrial but there

139
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:21,960
weren't from this you know particular time space so it gets into how you define that

140
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:29,160
uh but you know my understanding is you know if one of our whistleblowers who's passed away

141
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,880
sergeant stone he was on a retrieval team crash retrieval dealing with this in the 60s and

142
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:42,600
by late 60s he said there were 69 specific non-human extraterrestrial species that they

143
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,520
had cataloged 69 when you think about a successful business you think about a great product a cool

144
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,880
brand and sweet marketing but what you don't think about is the business behind the business

145
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,560
that's making the sales nobody does selling better than shopify it's the number one checkout on the

146
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:06,360
planet used by four million companies and they're not so secret secret shopify's shop pay boosts

147
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,680
conversions up to 50 meaning way less carts will go abandoned with shopify in minutes your store

148
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,720
can go from a blank canvas to a professional storefront that's unique to you and shopify has

sponsoring the show yeah and i'm sure it's way more than that now so that and his information

156
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:07,400
you know we before he passed away we got his archive that's in our archive and also we got

157
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,600
a very extensive interview with him and so there are many people like that who come forward and

158
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,120
told similar accounts now one of one of the problems is if you're in a compartment operation

159
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,200
like that you're not going to be read into or briefed on something of very similar nature

160
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,280
that's in a different base or another compartment operation it's very very compartmentalized is

161
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:36,760
what they call it so what i've tried to do is to see where it syncs up so let's say you have

162
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,200
you know 10 people who've been on crash retrieval teams that i've debriefed i'm

163
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:48,040
just making i was probably more than that where were they what did they see what was their

164
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:55,480
methodology and how much of that is congruent and when you get congruence from people who don't know

165
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,240
who each other are so i'm sort of my project the disclosure projects from the clearinghouse for

166
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,800
hundreds of these guys then you begin to be able to find out where the sweet spot of truth is

167
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,800
and try to put build out this picture so that's what we've tried to do it's been painstaking

168
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:21,800
when it comes to the 69 different variations of non-human life that this gentleman cataloged

169
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,560
the idea of the future humans thing is interesting to me when it comes to these

170
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,400
beings these short little gray alien beings with two legs and two arms

171
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:38,920
because if you if you think about how rare ours we are on homo sapiens on planet earth there's

172
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,640
like over two million cataloged species of animals on planet earth there's out of those two million

173
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:49,240
there's 20 hominids out of the 20 hominids only one of them figured out how to develop technology

174
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:56,920
to get off the planet so we are super rare on this planet alone so now you want to extrapolate

175
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,920
out into the universe and find all the other goldilocks planets that are able to inhabit life

176
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,840
they have different oxygen levels different gravity they have most of them are water worlds

177
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,280
very different atmospheres what are the chances they're also going to evolve

178
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:17,080
that something like us is going to evolve bipedal upright walking two arms two legs and a head that

179
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:22,360
says brain says directly on top of the head it's very high and here's why it's a high probability

180
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,720
that that would happen yes and if you look at the work of rupert shell drake at oxford and

181
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,720
morphogenic field propagation because of quantum entanglement let me explain to the audience what

182
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:41,320
that means quantum entanglement is at that level of quantum physics where every point in space and

183
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:49,480
time is interconnected now the ultimate quantum entangled field is mind or consciousness which

184
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,680
we can get into this this gets into the deep end of the pond very quickly but when something

185
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:03,240
let's say something works in one area and it becomes something that is within that morphogenic

186
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:11,640
field at a quantum entangled level it spontaneously begins to pop up elsewhere and this is known as

187
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,840
field propagation through quantum entanglement so it would make total sense that that'd be the case

188
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,040
now there's certainly be huge variety amongst that say that within that template and there may be

189
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:29,240
other forms as well but i think that form was called you know the form of a universal

190
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,920
person a head two arms two legs is probably pretty consistent now there may be others

191
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:44,600
but and they may have evolved from like we're 98 identical to chimps so take a look i mean some

192
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,720
of us more than others one of my best friends calls me a big eight because i'm muscly and furry

193
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:56,680
but but they you know so we just go okay that's us right but there could be a species that evolved

194
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,800
from the equivalent of a cetacean or a dolphin or a bird like or what have you right so i think

195
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:07,720
there's a huge amount of variation in the cosmos but there's it's not that surprising that there

196
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:14,280
would be this morphogenic field propagation is some people call it the hundredth monkey effect

197
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:20,840
where they studied monkeys on an isolated island and once the troop learned how to do a skill

198
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,040
right spontaneously hundreds of miles away the monkeys on another island started doing it

199
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,320
yeah it was like this entangled field right i understand what you're saying you're talking

200
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,760
more about consciousness but i'm talking like hard biology i am too but you're you're you're

201
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,400
acting like those are separate they're not so this how are they so how are they not separate

202
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,040
like like how like i'm saying like how is it if physically on a planet if the gravity is

203
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,240
different if the atmosphere is different if there's no land if it's all ocean but that's

204
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,640
external so i'm talking about the internal see here's the thing that's very interesting

205
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,080
we're different in every imaginable way but we're the same in a very essential way and that they're

206
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:08,200
sentient and conscious so let's talk about field consciousness and what ermine schrodinger the

207
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:14,600
father of modern particle wave theory in quantum physics in 1908 said the total number of minds

208
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:21,960
in the universe is one that is it is a singularity so i know it sounds very spuckian but this is a

209
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,560
fact actually it's been proven very union yeah it's been proven by dr john at princeton university

210
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,760
who had the princeton you know engineering anomalies research lab and i knew him before

211
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,920
he passed away and they did very accurate studies with random number generators where you just think

212
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,760
to it and it would change it from just equal distribution of zeros and ones to shifting to

213
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:51,080
say ones the digital they're just quantum digital random number generators very well done studies

214
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,920
have been replicated all over the world so what is that so we always think of ourselves as sort

215
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,120
of these islands that are completely separate because of 3d right our bodies the environment

216
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:08,440
but what if there's a level of not only in physics physically what they call quantum entanglement and

217
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:15,320
einstein called the spooky effect but also on a level of consciousness in mind it explains a

218
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:21,640
lot of phenomenon a great deal of the phenomenon so the one good thing before i went to medical

219
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,960
school you're gonna laugh it's such an anachronism now i was a became a meditation teacher and studied

220
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:34,520
sanskrit and the vedas and sort of learned really in depth about the science of consciousness on

221
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:41,400
all of that you're happy when i was i was 19 20 it was great fun yeah you know it was a sort of

222
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,760
you know i finished college when i first went in and i said what am i gonna do now so i said well

223
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:53,960
let's do this so i and that was a consequence of a contact experience i had and then that was a

224
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,160
consequence of having had a near-death experience when i was 17 so it sort of opened up that

225
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:05,400
trajectory into consciousness and the study of that and then where does that intercept with all

226
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,560
this well it's actually some turns out to be essential so you know you have this team of

227
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:17,960
people who've just defected from i can't say which black sites i've been at those black sites and they

228
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:26,680
were using a type of psionic or psychic interface with technology to intercept and bring

229
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,480
craft in and then hit them with electromagnetic pulse weapons right i've been at these sites i

230
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,080
know where they are and i've met some of the operators and it's real i mean it sounds like

231
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,160
science fiction but it didn't no it sounds like stranger things in real life well i mean everything

232
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,040
i mean the science fiction is all ripped out of the things that are real often but this is the

233
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:53,400
real end of it and it's serious but that's why the cia had a remote viewing program 30 years on

234
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,000
i know a lot of those original remote viewing guys and so that whole area where does that have

235
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
to do with ufos though what it has to do with the fact now i wrote about this in a 1991 paper

236
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,440
called the comprehensive assessment of the ufo eti subject extraterrestrial intelligence subject

237
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:19,560
and it describes two related things phenomenon that those civilizations have technology

238
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,840
that assists their consciousness in these capabilities but they also have the ability

239
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:32,120
to have their consciousness augment the technology so they can think to that camera it's like

240
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,000
neural link without the wires you know at the speed of thought ran the speed of electromagnetic

241
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:45,800
field propagation yeah so and that's real and and so civilizations that if they're you know from

242
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,640
the andromeda galaxy right and two and a half million light years from here they're not using

243
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,320
your cell phone at speed of light it would take two and a half million years to say hey how you're

244
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,280
doing right and another two and a half million years for you to return the reply right so the

245
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,800
speed of light ain't going to cut it so when you go what i call super luminal beyond the speed of

246
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:13,240
light super you're going into trans dimensional you're crossing dimensions and within those finer

247
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:20,120
dimensions it becomes more and more preeminent that you're using conscious fields and thought

248
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,600
and it's really strange stuff but it's true and so if you don't understand that you're never going

249
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:33,320
to understand extraterrestrial civilizations how much faster is this conscious super super luminal

250
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,920
instant so if you instant it's instant now not necessarily to transport systems but if

251
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,880
you're communicating it's in real time because there too you're let's say you're here and your

252
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,560
home base is two and a half million light years away it's because it's not going in a straight

253
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:57,080
line forget about the speed of light think again about this interrelated quantum entangled cosmos

254
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,480
at the level of not only thought and consciousness but consciousness but even very refined

255
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,040
electromagnetic systems so then you go boom it's in real time and this is where they've done studies

256
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,560
recently where they have teleported particles and they have the spooky effect where the same

257
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,680
particle can be in two places at once as einstein described so i don't know if i'm boring your

258
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,160
audience at this point but no you're not boring them but so at that point you begin to realize

259
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:31,720
that if you're a very advanced civilization and you want to become interstellar you're not going

260
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,840
to be using the junk that all of us think is so i'll get out from silicon valley i mean that's

261
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,760
rubbish right how did you figure this out this stuff the super luminal consciousness communication

262
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,680
well um well the truth i prefer the truth yeah well that was a bit of a long story but anyway

263
00:25:51,320 --> 00:26:00,440
in 1973 in march i got very sick and i died had near-death experience okay i was raised an atheist

264
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,880
and we didn't believe anything um it didn't fit in a test tube didn't it didn't exist nonsense

265
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:14,040
but i had this amazing beautiful experience actually and i had personally this experience of

266
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,600
my own say drop of my individuality becoming the ocean sort of this expanded

267
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,440
consciousness state um that was infinite it was boundless and it was very beautiful

268
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:32,840
and obviously i didn't die because here i am um but it was a very serious near-death experience

269
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:39,080
and about six months later uh no a couple months later i decided i'm going to learn meditation

270
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,720
because i said i want to get back to that state without getting sick and dying so i learned how

271
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:50,200
to meditate and started studying that and then i was up on a mountain in north carolina

272
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:57,560
upside the little town of boone north carolina and i was uh hiked up there before sunset

273
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:05,480
and i wanted to see uh the sunset and meditate and that was it and just before sunset i saw a

274
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:12,600
perfectly seamless uh disc that appeared uh and i'd seen of almost an identical one when i was

275
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,640
eight or nine in north carolina i grew up in the charlotte area and i went oh they're back

276
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,080
i didn't think anything more about it i just thought well there it is i mean i just accepted

277
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,120
this okay um because i looked into this when i was a kid after i had my sighting

278
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:32,200
but that's all that happened it was there and it didn't move off it just winked out just sort

279
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,200
of like dematerialized or vanished right so i go and i meditate i'm sitting there and it gets dark

280
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:46,600
and um when i open my eyes i have this the whole milky way is up above and i'm about over 5 000

281
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:55,800
feet up there crystal clear october 1973 and uh i had this beautiful thought that entered me i said

282
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:02,200
behold what a beautiful universe god has made and with that i went into that same experience i had

283
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:09,320
when i died it was it was phenomenal but i was in my body so uh i looked over and there was a glow

284
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:15,400
over the edge of the hill mountainside i think was that craft and there was a little there was a

285
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:23,080
person now i as an 18 year old kid i thought it was a deer standing on its hind legs had beautiful

286
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,840
eyes maybe about uh four and a half five feet tall i came over and it touched my right shoulder

287
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:36,920
and i left i just dematerialized for about four hours four hours yeah now i thought it was about

288
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:45,640
30 to 45 minutes something like that because time isn't the same in these dimensions but um so during

289
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:55,560
that encounter i started having this experience of where non-human and extra extraterrestrial

290
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:02,520
in humans where could we connect and it was at this place of non-locality it's called in physics

291
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:09,000
and consciousness so i started practicing this with these ets this episode is brought to you by

292
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,440
true work a clothing company hell bent on bringing you the most technical high performance work wear

293
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,080
on the face of the earth the true work story begins in the colorado mountains where a trade

294
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,120
worker knew there had to be a better solution than the wet heavy gear that was weighing him down and

295
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,280
true work was born i love true work because their clothing is real rugged heavy duty work wear built

296
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,880
for the 20th century and it's not uncomfortable it's better because it's soft comfortable stretchy

297
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,360
and fits better than traditional work wear and my favorite part is that when you're trying to be

298
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,680
agile bend down squat or contort your body in a weird way their jeans won't pinch your balls like

299
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:52,040
traditional skinny jeans that most nerds wear nowadays every true work product is engineered

300
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,080
for maximum efficiency comfort and protection and when you put them on you feel the difference

301
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,360
when i put on traditional cotton or denim pants i can literally feel the 200 year difference in

302
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:08,120
technology true work upgrades traditional classics with fabrics used by elite outdoor athletes

303
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:14,120
soft stretchy sweat wicking soft shell work pants are a huge upgrade over stiff heavy jeans

304
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,200
wind and waterproof shells use intelligently placed insulation for streamlined warmth and lets

305
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,960
you stay mobile and agile true work has over 50 000 five star reviews and countless stories from

306
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,800
trade pros in every state and every job across the country upgrade to true work for a major

307
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,440
change in the way you work true work helps you be your best when your best matters most check out

true works full lineup and get 15 off your first order at true work dot com slash danny that's 15

309
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:51,960
off at t r u e w e r k dot com slash danny it's linked below now back to the show and this

310
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,720
meditation yeah so we have an app called ce5 contact it's probably the most controversial

311
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,320
things i'm doing yeah i've heard of it yeah and it it works and if you look at the movie

312
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:09,480
close encounters of the fifth gun you're gonna go whoa wow um i just sent your producer a picture

313
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,640
of an et that appeared oh yeah you sent the alien can we see the alien that he said no the

314
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,520
aliens are from guatemala okay um these are extraterrestrial biological entities what's the

315
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:24,040
difference i'm just making a joke i know i know we're in florida nobody it's no we can't make

316
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,520
jokes in florida they're way dirtier than that it's impossible so this is where do you see this one

317
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:36,840
so this is in arizona a couple years ago um and we were doing the ce5 contact protocols um and uh

318
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,600
full screener steve yeah you have to do full screen otherwise it's useless yeah um he's learning

319
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:48,200
how to use there you go um so it looks like a beak and it's this round head and you see the

320
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,600
eye socket on the left there's a light source that was not ours coming from his left and uh sort of

321
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,520
a feathery tunic now this was about three feet from me and we had uh david marconi who wrote

322
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:06,440
enemy of the state with will smith had a great nicon camera set up on a tripod with a remote

323
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:14,040
and we had seen what looked like a red orb right between this older gentleman and a member of our

324
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:20,920
team and it was me and and i said take a picture here and he did and here's this this person that

325
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:27,400
we had heard walking around behind us without seeing it with the naked eye uh but it captured

326
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:34,600
this uh this person it's weird it's very unusual like i can't it's hard to make anything well if

327
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,600
oh no i mean the the right eye socket you can see it's a very big head with like a beak like

328
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:47,000
nose yeah and then a tunic and the right hand there i mean this is at night with you know no

329
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,760
illumination by the way we're out there in the middle of the wilderness in pitch black

330
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:58,200
so this by the way this we call this et the healer because he has appeared at other times and the man

331
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,520
right beside him had lost his hearing since he was in uh middle or high school and even with

332
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,640
hearing aids he could barely hear and this wait what is that next is that oh that's just like a

333
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,760
light orb or something right there steve that's just some to the left this thing yeah looks like

334
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,200
a i don't know that's the man that's that older gentleman oh that's a person yeah you know eyes

335
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,280
checked that's a person so it looks like a face floating in the middle of the no no no he's sitting

336
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:29,480
in our we're in chairs in a circle okay yeah we could give you the whole context though but

337
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,000
what's interesting is that he was healed of his hearing loss uh by next morning he woke up wow

338
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,920
totally fixed so it's you know i've been doing this since i was 18 so now i'm 69 so for 51 years

339
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:49,880
and what i find interesting about retail ufology it's always i was abducted and i was and i was

340
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,400
tortured and i was this i'm going yeah that's the cia you mentioned the grays i know who

341
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:01,400
manufactures those you know who manufactures the aliens yes they're not aliens well the gray the

342
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,520
gray beings that like willy streber talks about yeah the the fake ones as they're called so so how

343
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,840
do they get them to abduct people like there's all these stories that john mack has has talked

344
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:16,600
about oh yeah i knew john very well yeah and then he he talked to i think hundreds of people that

345
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,080
explained being abducted by the little grays and taken up into ships and had to sperm and eggs

346
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,480
extracted from them yeah as if how do you explain that about delusions of grandeur like they need

347
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,320
our sperm and eggs um have you heard the theory that they're will the future human theory like

348
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,920
if there was a cataclysmic event in the future like way in the future and they had to come back

349
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:43,080
in time to get our dna to repropagate humanity in the future that oh yeah that's a hypothesis

350
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:50,040
yeah i call it the cosmic noah's arc yeah right yes uh no but i mean there's a mixture of things

351
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:57,480
so here remember this okay october 1954 we mastered gravity control who mastered it

352
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,960
covert programs in the united states aerospace but there was a there was a couple people working

353
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:09,640
on it there was louis witten and no i'm talking about that if you take t towns and browns work

354
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,120
okay t towns and brown and the b phil brown effect all that started in the 20s

355
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,320
and if you look at a film that we released a couple years ago called the lost century it kind

356
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,680
of unpacks all this it's a documentary okay and and and people should look at that it explains

357
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,120
all this in this trajectory of how this evolved and so there were experiments with very high

358
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:37,160
voltage systems that called an electrogravitic effect where things would lift right okay and

359
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,840
that was in the 20s that was 28 29 it was replicated in germany and the houseky frost

360
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:49,000
experiment we have a physics journal we show that in the film okay it's in here and for the briefing

361
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,360
now imagine those early experiments with so-called anti-gravity okay not a good term but those use

362
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:03,000
the pop culture term it's actually electro-gravitics uh and electro-gravitic field propulsion but we're

363
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:09,880
you know it's not a physics class okay so what happened is that this that research combined

364
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:17,640
with a augmentation of that research a big leap forward by studying the extraterrestrial vehicles

365
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:25,800
that we downed right in the mid-40s and 50s right so by the time those two streams combined into a

366
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,160
mighty river of research but it was covert as i was referring to that wilbur smith document most

367
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,760
secret and he said this is the most secret operation in the united states exceeding the

368
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:43,240
secrecy of the hydrogen bomb research now this is 1950 before we detonate the first atom hydrogen

369
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:49,720
bomb so imagine something more classified and secret than the h bomb the ultimate doomsday weapon

370
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:56,120
that's this stuff so you know my uncle i had his whole career at northrop raman uh he worked on the

371
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:03,080
lunar module that land on the moon but those big aerospace companies northrop raman lockheed skunk

372
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:11,000
works and now raytheon e g and g way back then and others they got the portfolio for their special

373
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:19,080
projects to study this material figure out how it worked and then apply it yeah so by 1954

374
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:26,840
we had operational gravity control so that we were building our own ufos and i always tell people

375
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:34,200
if you see something you call a ufo or uap you have to ask yourself it's one of be one of three

376
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:42,440
things it could be an extraterrestrial vehicle or nhi craft it's the pop culture now it can be a

377
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,600
man-made one coming out of one of these big aerospace companies because they've been zipping

378
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,560
around since the late 50s right or it could be not neither of them and it could be some

379
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,280
uh extra-dimensional entity something from another dimension that's not extraterrestrial

380
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,160
so my a way though this is where it gets confusing for people and it's deliberately

381
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,360
been commingled in other words disinformation specialists yeah from the cia and other places

382
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:11,080
like lou elezando his yeah he called you a terrorist yeah i know it's very funny i'm a

383
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:16,040
terrorist for speaking the truth well that's yeah i mean you know as opposed to people who

384
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:22,200
are actually trying to create armageddon which would be his crowd yeah but the problem is is

385
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,400
that if you don't have enough of the information and this information has been in a blackout for

386
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:33,800
70 years you know if you're a if you're a david fravor flying an f-18 chasing one of these things

387
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,000
and you don't you're not read and you're you're a jet pilot you're not read into what's coming out

388
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,040
of the underground facilities at skunkworks out there in the desert yeah so you're gonna

389
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,960
immediately think oh shit i just saw an alien craft no you saw something that was made at

390
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,160
the skunkworks that was moving in a way with no visible means of propulsion i was just trying

391
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:02,680
to clarify earlier on on the on the anti-gravity side of things um jeremy riss alien scientist

392
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:10,360
as a physics historian was explaining to me that um there was two i think two main groups one was

393
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,520
lewis witten and his the people that he was working on it with and then brice dewitt

394
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:21,320
who was working on anti-gravity in like the earlier 50s like before 54 um and he thinks that one of

395
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:26,520
them figured it out and then i guess from my understanding is that went black all of a sudden

396
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:32,280
yeah like we got co-opted by somebody and then like in 50 i think it was 57 there was like a um

397
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,280
what was it there was some big like anti-gravity conference or something right where they were

398
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,240
trying to figure but why would they have that conference in 57 if they had figured it out in

399
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:45,960
54 you know what i mean well because of compartment i mean the left hand doesn't know the right hand

400
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,640
exists i mean i've done i've done briefings for the head of the defense intelligence agency three

401
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,400
serge general and he didn't know anything that's going on with this even though he made inquiries

402
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,000
he was blown off so everyone thinks that they're sort of this you know you're the president or

403
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,480
you're a three or four star general you have an all-access pass you do not uh and that is what

404
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,280
my big coming of age on this and why i started the disclosure project right in 1993 was when i

405
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,920
briefed the director of the cia for bill clinton i learned in two or three hours will see yeah our

406
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,760
james will see who's since flipped on everybody how did he find you by the way one a friend of

407
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:34,840
his that he had been on the board of the the um a think tank pentagon think tank uh knew him and knew

408
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:41,240
was following what we were doing and it was mainly because in 1992 here in pensacola florida near

409
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:48,760
there we had a ce5 contact team and we vectored in four et craft and one of them was on the front

410
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,960
page of the pensacola paper got picked up by the intelligence community and before you know it i

411
00:40:53,960 --> 00:41:00,200
had all kinds of spooks knocking on my door um you know everyone who laughs at that i say yeah

412
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,880
what you're missing is the main part of the secret dude you know you're missing the big picture

413
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:09,080
totally you know you're flat earthers if you say if you think the the universe is 3d flat

414
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:16,760
you know you're a flatter society you know but um anyway so that got on the radar of this think

415
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:23,000
tank that was looking into the subject under a contract with the pentagon and then and and the

416
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,280
director of that think tank and the ci director were friends so once he became director ce cia

417
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,840
he and clinton and some other people webster hubbell at justice were trying to find out about ufos

418
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,600
and they were being gaslit and lied to or deceived and they knew it i mean clinton was smart enough

419
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:47,480
to know he was being zoomed and so they reached out to me to come up and and provide the information

420
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,440
i had now initially i will say if you look in my archive you'll see the the letter the

421
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,960
correspondence about this um i thought they were just trying to pick my brain and there was like

422
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:05,240
you know intel gathering exercise no i mean the director cia and the president had been completely

423
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:10,920
denied access threatened and told nothing and i you know at that time look i'm a 30

424
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:17,240
uh something your mid-30s medical doctor working full-time and as er you know like the show or

425
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:23,320
something never seen the show um but the truth is is that i thought surely they have more

426
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:29,400
information than i do this is nuts so and and they were just lying about what the purpose of

427
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,200
the meeting was right and they were just trying to gather information from me but it wasn't he was

428
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:40,120
shaken uh and they really did and that's when i realized that the organization that's running

429
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:46,680
that's running these covert programs is unconstitutional criminal and has been since

430
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:52,920
the late 1950s since eisenhower kind of lost control of them he was betrayed so there has

431
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,960
been no proper legal constitutional oversight of any of these operations and this is dangerous

432
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:06,360
since at least 1956-7 somewhere in that period yeah yeah and that's where grush came into the

433
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:12,120
picture and he was tasked to track down some of this lost black budget money right and that's

434
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,200
where when all these whistleblowers started to come out recently well not really i mean

435
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:24,280
we that's a late recent event yeah okay so there were more significant events that happened in the

436
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:33,160
90s that uh people don't know about or don't talk about um uh because clinton had set up

437
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:40,920
a military team you know because they used to call it team blue was the regular military

438
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,440
team black were these illegal projects and he set up what's called team red

439
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:51,080
to penetrate those covert illegal programs most of those and i know some of these guys most of

440
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:57,240
those guys were killed or absorbed into team black so some of the whistleblowers just now coming

441
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:04,040
forward some of the older ones had been on team red i can't say which ones but they'll disclose

442
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:11,480
that when they're ready and they got totally pulled into these illegally run operations now

443
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:20,440
remember if you're a 18 20 25 year old delta force guy or green beret you're not read into

444
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,040
the chain of command up above you you just go yes sir and you're going to do what you're going to

445
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:31,080
do right but once they reached a certain level of seniority they realized they were in an illegal

446
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:36,760
criminal operation which is when they reached out to me and they said one of them said thank you

447
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,880
for what you're doing for those of us stuck on the other side meaning stuck in this illegal

448
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:48,600
criminal operation and they want out so the good thing is there's a momentum happening now if we

449
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:53,640
can get whistleblower protections through the congress and executive order from the president

450
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:00,760
where there's a whole damn rate of break of folks like that right that we have who will

451
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:08,920
come forward and with the evidence and this will be begin to be solved it's just the beginning

452
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,200
so that's what we're trying to work on but it way way way predates grow i met with mr grush

453
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,880
when he was still undercover and gave him information and his bosses were people that

454
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,400
were people i had briefed in the skiff the secure compartment information facility

455
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:31,560
so he came out with what he had done but he was secondhand he had not been operational

456
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,320
i'm talking about the first-hand operational people what's interesting if you look at the

457
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,440
house oversight committee hearings it's all been all these secondhand people and i i told

458
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:46,120
congressman bruchette and lunas why don't you subpoena the people that we have here's a list

459
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:51,640
of the top 25 right and these are people like i just described who are operational at the skunk

460
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:58,040
works interestingly they never call those people to a hearing i said don't call me i'm just the

461
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:03,640
doorway i'm the opener right call these guys and here are their name and by the way here's their

462
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:10,680
dd-214 and here's where they're operational so you know you have to wonder why i mean are really

463
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:16,600
people that clueless in washington or something going on there i don't know yeah so your disclosure

464
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:28,280
project has i believe over 400 military witnesses 760 something now 760 yeah and what would you say

465
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:40,040
is the most credible out of all of those witnesses well you know it's that the hole is greater than

466
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,480
the sum of the parts now remember i think these guys just starting to come out who've dealt with

467
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:53,240
the targeting and downing of these craft and how they've done it and the collateral damage

468
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,080
the civilians in private airplanes that have been killed in the process

469
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:03,720
that is one of the biggest stories in american history that's about to come out so private planes

470
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,760
that have come down so let me explain how this works so let's say you're out at some black site

471
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,160
out in the desert out west okay i i won't say which one i was and i've i've been in this

472
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:19,560
special forces guy's chopper that's on the retrieval teams and flown over this area

473
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:26,520
um and seen the equipment and the underground base opening all that um i have pictures and

474
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:32,520
videos of it it's in here it's in your presidential briefing right here yeah and that actually this is

475
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,560
available for people to order now we've sanitized some of the sensitive names out and you can go

476
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:42,520
and order it in a heart this thing right this whole thing there's how do you order it well i

477
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,560
don't know i don't do you know that my assistant will give you guys a link but you everyone

478
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,400
listening can get one and how would they go about doing that they would get the link from

479
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,520
your assistant no well no you can put it up you know i can put a link to it and our drsteven

480
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:02,120
grue dot com there'll be a link to it right raven anyway um i don't do that stuff but and then this

481
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:08,040
is and then what is your plan with with this your briefing this has already been provided to the

482
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:14,440
incoming new president and to some of his senior folks and we're continuing and also to the key

483
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,680
oversight committee senate intelligence armed services and what did they what was their reaction

484
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,680
to it but they well they're just now studying it it's an enormous amount of information and

485
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:29,880
intelligence so um there are some entities that are on the enforcement end of u.s government

486
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:35,080
that are now drilling down heavy on the same methods and sources that are in here

487
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:42,360
the people the witnesses the whistleblowers and the facilities and corporations um probably one

488
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:49,960
of the most significant uh people to come forward if we can protect him is the former chairman of a

489
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,600
fortune 50 company that's been involved with this it's a household name i won't say which one

490
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:00,920
and he wants to come forward he's like 80 years old this year and he deeply regrets what they've

491
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,600
done and you know he's admitted that they have the schematics and the designs to provide free

492
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:12,680
energy quote unquote to the whole world and he he really regrets all this secrecy but at the same

493
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:20,520
time he as soon as he reached out to me through his assistant and friend fortune 50 one of the

494
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,480
top 50 companies yeah it's huge and can we play come on can i guess no i'm not gonna play that

495
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:30,120
game no i don't but i would betray that man's trust because it'd be easy for someone to figure

496
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:36,120
out who it is it wasn't a military contractor though it's a big company that has a lot of

497
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:44,520
fingers and a lot of pies right okay um but uh this man then was threatened and they threatened

498
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:50,680
to kill his whole family and his grandchildren so uh what i'm trying what i'm trying to get

499
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:58,840
and it was you know the senate intelligence committee passed in 2023 unanimously uh the

500
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:05,080
provision to give amnesty or safe harbor to these kind of people right yep but the house in the

501
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:11,640
reconciliation of the bill took it out due to a couple of guys who were i think bad actors there

502
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,680
yeah who were those guys again were those the ohio guys the ohio no yeah mike turner mike turner

503
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:22,280
was chair of senate intelligence and the other mike rogers who is chair of armed services and

504
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:28,360
a few other people gutted that and it will kind of and why why do you think those two guys because

505
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:33,000
i think they receive a lot of funding from the very people there that need to be exposed i mean

506
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,800
you know i think it's not obviously uh they're carrying water for someone

507
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:43,960
which is corruption um but that's washington right i mean who's got the money who's got the

508
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:49,720
blackmail file on you right you know yep people get bribed people get threatened people get killed

509
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:57,880
it's not a conspiracy theory it's a fact um i've had all those games run on me so um but i think

510
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,600
that there's you know someone like that would have you know a lot of the keys to the kingdom

511
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:09,960
but if you're at risk for rico charges right federal racketeering influence corrupt organization

512
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:17,640
charges due to the criminal activity that you oversaw as an executive and maybe worse things

513
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:24,520
but you're also under threat from the organization keeping the secret of having you or your family

514
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,280
killed like this gentleman i don't think he would mind if he got killed but he doesn't want his

515
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:34,040
children and grandchildren killed and what what is his what did he see what is his what is his

516
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,120
connection to this stuff he's a chairman of a massive corporation but he was read into

517
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,600
a very special projects compartmented area dealing with the technology and that's the reason he won't

518
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,720
he doesn't want to come forward publicly because he's he's been threatened his family's been

519
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:54,680
threatened of course yeah and so it's now i know who he is and the people who are going to need

520
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:03,400
to know you know the president the you know attorney general law enforcement and on down

521
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:11,160
the system will know or do know by now so the only question becomes what are they gonna do about it

522
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:18,920
um now you know when i was beginning to tell you about these black sites all right now imagine

523
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:24,520
okay you're out in a desert site remote no access i mean ground sensors you're not going to get in

524
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:37,640
there um easily and underneath the ground out there there is a huge complex of stiffs there's

525
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,560
subterranean facilities and some people are dumb steep underground military bases

526
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:51,080
and in our briefing document you can get it actually has 150 or so of these sites where ufo

527
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:56,760
related operations have been some are key ones some have been incidental or peripheral ones right

528
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,040
and that's available for anyone to look at anyone who wants to look at it can see it okay um and

529
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:08,920
and so i'm in this chopper hovering over one of these and there's the opening from underground

530
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:16,520
where the man-made ufos go up go over a test range and they're hit with electromagnetic weapons

531
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:21,880
to see how hardened they are before they're good to go those are man-made and they're manned with

532
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:27,000
with people and are these similar to like tic tac stuff the tic tac ufos they're all shapes

533
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,320
they're all different shapes eggs they're octagonal they're discs they're the ones that are

534
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:38,920
northrop grumman and raytheon generally not all tend to be triangular or trapezoidal

535
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:47,000
or they're not necessarily equilateral triangles okay you know okay isosceles

536
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:55,640
and many of the ones that are cigar shaped or tic tac shaped or discs or octagonal

537
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:02,440
are locking skunk works e g and g and some others so all the prime contractors that we know of

538
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:08,520
where we have sources are named in the briefing document and i've been building that list for 30

539
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:16,120
years right ever since i was asked to put it together um and you know the problem is and this

540
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:23,720
gets to sort of a gut check here of what are you gonna do about it because let's say you're the

541
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:29,000
president or you're if i was his own patrick beth david show a couple days ago he's a big

542
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:36,600
broadcaster and a great guy and he asked me he said well you know do you think the president is

543
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:43,720
the most powerful man in the world i said well he could be but he isn't he's he showed a clip of

544
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:49,880
mr trump saying he is but he when they realize what they're up against with this

545
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:56,680
the power you're talking about derives from extraordinary technological prowess

546
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:04,280
so to make this real for people i just tell this is a sort of apocryphal but in 1997

547
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:15,160
excuse me i was asked to do a stand-up briefing for and this document leaked a report about this

548
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:23,480
leaked out of egger mitchell's archive when he died but my military advisor will be seen

549
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:30,200
tomorrow who's retired um and i and egger mitchell the six man the walk on the moon and

550
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:39,720
an eisenhower era whistleblower right and my assistant sherry adamak were in attendance but

551
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:46,520
i was asked to do a stand-up briefing for admiral tom wilson who is j2 the head of intelligence

552
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:56,760
joint staff and you know prior to the briefing i'd sent over something similar to this but

553
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,360
different but one of the documents that was in there is in here and it's a national reconnaissance

554
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:07,160
office with nr o which is the big entity that runs all the spy satellites

555
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:16,120
document from area 51 nellis warning of civilians trying to spy on the range where they test

556
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:22,440
and do the research on the man-made ufos right and they didn't want that to get out but in that it's

557
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:28,040
a not been declassified but it's legit and it lists the project code numbers and names right

558
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:35,080
so and it's a 91 document this meeting is in 97 so it wasn't antique right so i give it

559
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:41,800
i have a someone hand deliver it to the admiral prior to the meeting so he starts digging into

560
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:48,280
this and he hits peter he finds a few key offices where this is going on he calls them up and he

561
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:54,360
says hey you know i want to be read into this and he says i'm admiral tom wilson i'm j2 head of

562
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:59,960
intelligence joint staff and they say sir we can't discuss this with you and you don't have a need

563
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,600
to know and of course his reaction was well god damn it i mean i'm the head of intelligence with

564
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,840
the joint chiefs of staff how can i not have a need to know right excuse my language but i mean

565
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:16,440
this is like mind-blowing right all right so then he gets threatened and he's threatened with being

566
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:23,000
demoted where they take a star off your lapel and put you out to pasture with much lower benefits

567
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:30,120
and pay and retirement yeah let's be real 2025 has been all about change and a big change for me

568
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:35,480
is how i've been dealing with the world these mind-blowing guests and general life stress

588
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:22,040
backed off of it but at the meeting at the end of the meeting and it was supposed to be 45 minutes

589
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:28,120
i think it went on for two or three hours he kept canceling appointments i asked him i said we need

590
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:33,720
your help you know i'm just an emergency doctor doing this because i'm interested but it's serious

591
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:39,800
stuff and he asked me who else has had this happen to them i said well the secretary of defense

592
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:45,720
the ci director the president he said well what am i going to do i said yeah but you're here key

593
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:51,800
in the military in the pentagon and he says no here's what i've learned and this is how he said

594
00:59:51,800 --> 01:00:00,040
it he says i've learned that the best thing i have in the normal constitutional government and military

595
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:07,480
is a b2 stealth and that organization have craft that are anti-gravity that can do circles he did

596
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:13,320
like this circles around my b2 still he says it's point set match he said you know we're

597
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:20,200
checkmated because of the technology so now we're into the horns of the dilemma right here because

598
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:27,880
you know i realized going up against corrupt interests that have that level of technology

599
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:34,120
which is very dangerous and when i literally tell people the threat from that organization

600
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:41,080
which is international have these technologies far exceeds the threat of china iran russia

601
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:47,880
terrorism and by order of magnitude and no one's doing anything about it because no one has quite

602
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:53,800
figured out what the threat matrix is what the threat assessment so what we're trying to do

603
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:59,480
not to scare the hell out of these officials but to say here's the problem here's a solution

604
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:08,360
now the solution the best outcome of this that we're recommending is a glide path out

605
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:15,320
that's not kinetic in other words not violent it's not a it's not a a red on black war

606
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:22,520
or something it's giving people who want to come forward a path out and they take it

607
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:30,440
and it unravels that system and it gets transformed into another initiative that those old legacy

608
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:39,240
programs that have been going along without any accountability for 60 plus years those are put out

609
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:45,640
the pasture so and wound down but it's got to happen that way or it's going to be a mess

610
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:55,960
are you saying that these organizations that are in possession of this technology and that

611
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:01,880
control this stuff that are keeping it away from the u.s government are they like their own

612
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:08,120
autonomous government a slash military slash air force that is completely

613
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:13,880
detached from any other world government they're detached and embedded at the same time

614
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:20,040
so and almost and and more arguably more powerful oh way more absolutely way more

615
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,920
this is why you know it's interesting when jimmy carter you know i was asked not to tell this

616
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,600
story he's passed away now so

617
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:36,840
he's adjusting your camera when president carter was some years ago in spain signing guitars

618
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:44,680
it was a classical guitarist who was there told me this who's part of our team and he said that

619
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:49,640
at the words it was a fundraiser for the carter center you know okay and they were auctioning

620
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:56,600
off these guitars right president signed them and at a dinner afterwards there were a few people

621
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:02,280
there and someone asked him they said sir what was it like being the most powerful man in the

622
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:09,000
world and president carter says i wasn't that man and they go what do you mean he says well there

623
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,680
are certain things that i had no control over and i wasn't even allowed to know about and someone

624
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:21,720
giggled or joking well you mean things like ufos and he said yes that and more so

625
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:32,520
that was of course he was president 7680 took off 77 january left in 81 and reagan came in right so

626
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:39,960
once you understand that then you go well who is mining the store here well it's sort of like if

627
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:45,880
you remember a brilliant guy senator ennui of hawaii who did the iran contra hearings right

628
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:52,040
right right and and he said there exists a secret government shadow government with its own air

629
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:57,880
force its own navy its own funding mechanism that's free from the law and above the law itself

630
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:05,640
i'm paraphrasing but that that clip is in our archive and years later after i did the original

631
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:12,360
disclosure project conference in 2001 an attorney on our team who was then an intern

632
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:18,440
undergraduate intern was met with senator ennui and we had just done the national press club event

633
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:27,240
in 2001 right before 9 11 and and this attorney derrick arcia has written an affidavit to this

634
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:32,760
effect he talked to senator ennui he says yes and you know like basically these ufo issues that's

635
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:38,920
the crown jewel of this shadow secret government operation right and it is above the constitution

636
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:45,880
and the law but the kinds of technologies they have i mean we're not talking about a jet aircraft

637
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:52,760
or a rocket you know i tell people rockets were cool and up until 1954 so if you think space x

638
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:59,560
rocket is called get out you're you're only 70 years behind the times bro so but that's fact

639
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:06,840
but this means that you have an organization you know some initial one of the initials on that

640
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:13,640
nr o document was a magic stands for majority joint intelligence committee or magi mha i

641
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:19,800
magi that's fun yeah do you think that any of these witnesses are our strategic disinfo like

642
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:24,440
if i was the secret government that had control of this stuff i would deliberately inject some

643
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:29,480
bullshit into this and put some i would absolutely put some fake whistleblowers out there yep and

644
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:33,880
that's something we have to always we've had this happen a couple times right before we did the

645
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:39,880
meeting for admiral wilson we had a gathering off site for members of congress and the chairman of

646
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:45,880
the house oversight committee was there dan burton and all those people and we found out the night

647
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:52,920
before uh and i don't credit myself with this my military advisor who has to be nameless

648
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:58,040
and egger mitchell another person was sitting at a bar with this guy and he started telling things

649
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:04,680
that they knew were factually not true so i got word of that i was already up in my room i said

650
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:11,320
that person is removed and escorted off the properties immediately and if necessary by force

651
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:16,760
so that person was ejected from the meeting that was happening the next day with these

652
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:22,040
members of congress so yeah of course i mean that that's something we always watch for and you know

653
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:29,480
i'm not 100 but i'm certain that what i'm sharing with you about this is true and i don't rely on

654
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:35,640
one source so in other words if something the crazier the count is the more i want to hear from

655
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:42,280
multiple corroborating witnesses that don't know each other so there's no collusion so that's what

656
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:48,600
we've tried to build with this mosaic this disclosure mosaic to create the picture yes because

657
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:52,600
you could always have two or three people who work with each other that come fabulate the same

658
01:06:52,600 --> 01:07:00,760
nonsense right so it's uh that's something that happened with this recent fella that was just on

659
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:06,680
jesse michaels podcast jake barber i believe his last name is no i know jake very well yeah he

660
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:13,320
mentioned you um fantastic little documentary that jesse michaels put together and um michael

661
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:20,760
herrera i believe yeah and he mentioned during that during that interview that jake and i'm

662
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,000
probably butchering this i don't remember it perfectly but he said that he was a part of some

663
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:31,640
secret black program going to one of your conferences to try to subvert some of your

664
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,840
witnesses a year and a half ago some of your witness oh that was a year and a half ago

665
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:40,920
and then when he heard this guy michael herrera's testimony he said holy shit that's exactly what i

666
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:46,120
was doing yep i think that was a i i saw this with my own eyes and then he said he had some

667
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:51,480
coming to jesus moment where he said oh no i can't do this i have to i have to go against the grain

668
01:07:51,480 --> 01:08:00,040
here no he's legit no he's he's he's i know his cover i know who he worked for i've been at the

669
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:08,680
facilities jake barber and his team and uh fred and and also uh don paul great guys and uh they're

670
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:15,400
not gaslighting anyone now they're not sharing everything either because you know it's dangerous

671
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:21,960
but um now there's some unsavory people that i think have attached themselves to these guys

672
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:27,240
um you know the lou elizando crowd and the whole disinformation nexus of

673
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:31,720
retail yeah i want to get to that i don't i want you to explain that to me later i don't want to

674
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,400
like interject that right now but that's something i would definitely want to put a pin in yeah

675
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:40,680
yeah well it's just wait this way the world works man um in one part information

676
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:47,720
nine parts disinformation right one part truth and by the way the best disinformation false

677
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:54,840
information it's sort of like a poison pill it's coated in real information you swallow it and then

678
01:08:54,840 --> 01:09:02,280
you're done right so this technique of counterintelligence i'm quite versed in

679
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:08,440
and how it operates uh and how the psyops psychological warfare operations run these

680
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:14,120
operations on people who are innocent good people but harrera by the way had approached me some

681
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:19,640
years ago and michael harrera was a marine for people who don't know you can go to our archive

682
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:24,360
and see this account uh and the illustration of what he saw okay can you explain it for people

683
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:33,800
who don't sure so he was it was in i believe 2009 and he was a young marine i think 20 years old

684
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,720
and there was a tsunami an earthquake in indonesia and they were on an expeditionary force a

685
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:45,320
humanitarian mission to go there and help people and out of the pacific they were in the pacific

686
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:52,760
region and he and five of his platoon buddies went off in the direction and in the jungle

687
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:58,840
and there was a clearing and there was a 300 foot diameter man-made ufo

688
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:04,520
basically octagonal he knew this it was man he knew that it was oh he could tell it was man-made

689
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:11,800
and it was manned by special operations guys but in civilian garb they were told you know basically

690
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:18,600
put down your weapons they confiscated their weapons they took their ids they threatened to

691
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:24,520
kill them for having for being seen this and one of the things he saw they're trying to kill their

692
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:30,840
own u.s marines well they're not their own this is this shadow secret government these right right

693
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:35,080
okay i mean those are the real people committing treason and traitors and yes they'll kill their

694
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:40,840
own i mean look at jonathan wygon's testimony when he was in the peruvian bolivian border

695
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:47,080
where we shot down an et craft and he and his guys came across at first and the security people

696
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:51,400
who were in there to retrieve it said you talk about this we'll fill you out of the helicopter

697
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,600
and they'll never find you in the jungle so this happens all the time they do kill their own people

698
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:00,200
but they're not their own people they're americans though right yeah they're americans but it's you

699
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:05,080
know these are people who are running a criminal enterprise the biggest you know think of the mafia

700
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:11,320
it's the largest criminal organization on the planet so you know when the fbi is ready and

701
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:16,760
wants to grow up and be serious they have a real target here with technology that very few

702
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:22,040
human beings can comprehend so the other thing that michael Herrera saw was this crate and it

703
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:29,880
was a it was a it was a and it looked like it had like a little oxygen and hvc mini a portable unit

704
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:36,680
on it and he thought they were running drugs and it turned out because jake was at this conference

705
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:42,680
to try to bump witnesses and see who need to be turned over for either wet works or arrest

706
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:51,240
um he heard this and of course he immediately texted me because he has my number and he we went

707
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:57,480
to the green jake did yeah and his security guy so he knew you oh yeah but he was going to your

708
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:03,560
conference to subvert some of your witnesses well that's what his job was it was to find

709
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:11,480
and stop leaks and find out if i had the panasonic tough book that had been missing out of one of

710
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:16,840
these corporations i know which one it is that had all this intel on it because i receive stuff

711
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:24,280
all the time right and he thought maybe i had it um now i didn't know that's why he was there

712
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:30,760
right and prior to that i'd had a meeting with one of his security people at a bar near langley and

713
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:37,400
near cia tyson's corner in virginia and he gave me a little thumb drive that was like a 10 page

714
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:43,960
description of his involvement what he was doing and he subsequently a month or two later came

715
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:49,960
june uh 2023 to this disclosure project conference and press conference we did

716
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:56,040
where herrera and some other whistleblowers were speaking and but he immediately said i need to see

717
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:04,200
you so i'll go back to the green room and he says that isn't drugs those are people and so what they

718
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:09,800
were doing what they the way they get their psionic and other staff let's call it at these

719
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,480
underground facilities is let's say there's a terrible disaster or war-torn area and people

720
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:21,480
are desperate and they're they're not kidnapped per se but it's under duress they're basically told

721
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:29,160
you can either come with us and be part of our program i'll describe it in a moment or you can

722
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:36,120
stay here and die you choose now i wouldn't call that a very but this is how it is this is brutal

723
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:42,040
stuff right oh yeah and that's what was in those crates these are people and they were people who

724
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:47,480
were candidates for being how do they discern what kind of people they need they were looking for

725
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:54,120
people with a certain demographic that they felt would have a high psionic capability and am i

726
01:13:54,120 --> 01:14:00,200
correct in saying they were children they were children there were women somehow there's a

727
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:07,080
tendency for left-handedness for that ability and gay and bisexual men so that's who they were

728
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:12,520
looking for because it like ingo swan was i knew him very well ingo was and he was a gay guy

729
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:19,160
brilliant remote viewer so and who cares i mean people get hung up on that i said well it was

730
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:23,800
like if you're gay raise your hand if you're left-handed like we need you no no they don't

731
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,320
do it that way i know this might be silly but i mean they will scope out and then they'll say

732
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:32,840
they'll and of course it's a rough uh sort of assessment they're then created up taken to a

733
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:41,080
facility and the ones that pass muster for their psi capabilities psionic psychic capabilities

734
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:46,600
go through a program now a lot of those end up dying because they're put on drugs dopamine

735
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:55,160
electromagnetic enhancement so many end up dying or or put in comas and wait wait hold on man

736
01:14:55,160 --> 01:15:00,680
so so so getting these people so this specific situation michael Herrera was in indonesia after

737
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:05,560
there was an earthquake they essentially you don't want to say kidnapped because it's not a nice way

738
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:10,840
to putting it but it's essentially kidnapped them and taken under some dress i mean come with us or

739
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,680
die right i mean i don't know you can call that whatever you want it sounds like some level of

740
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:23,000
human trafficking um brought these children to the to a secret base secret black site that they

741
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:31,640
control for psychic warfare and and for training to be psionic hijackers of et craft that's just

742
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:38,120
the next part of it and they trained him to be psychic psionic what is so yeah to hijack these

743
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:42,680
crap and you're saying that they put they gave them drugs what kind of drugs do they give them

744
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:46,760
and why do they give them drugs i don't have the whole protocol i just know that they were

745
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:53,720
dopamine related and also there were electromagnetic systems and there were some bad a lot of bad

746
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:58,840
outcomes but the ones who passed through it have an extraordinary capability but it's an enhanced

747
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:05,000
so basically the way they described it to me is that you have the people who are the operators say

748
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:12,440
the regular human covert folks right these people are humans that are sort of machine tools

749
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:20,360
that are then used to then tap into the guidance and control systems of these et craft because

750
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:26,920
they're using what i just described technology assisted consciousness where they're you know you

751
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,880
think to it you see these accounts of the et standing there touching something they just

752
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:36,840
think and it goes there so okay i know this is getting out there but no it's not it's it

753
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:41,000
makes the crazy thing is it makes sense oh it totally makes sense and of course this goes back

754
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:48,280
to my 1973 experience with the et's where i knew this is what they were using so and i believe

755
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:54,040
that's why in 1992 general stubblebine personally offered me two billion dollars to be part of his

756
01:16:54,040 --> 01:17:00,840
little freak show by the way what yeah i said no gracias i mean he offered you two billion dollars

757
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:07,720
in 1992 dollars yeah why did you say no well because i'm not a corrupt person oh my god two

758
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:13,000
billion dollars i saved lives for a living i don't want to be part of a cabal of sociopaths

759
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,200
and psychopaths destroying the planet right what did he say no price two billion i'd be part of

760
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:23,240
his team a senior member of his team because of my abilities and also being a doctor with these

761
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:28,840
capabilities i mean they were going to and who was he exactly he had been i'm not familiar with

762
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:35,720
head of inscom and he was head of army intelligence and general albert stubblebine the third and

763
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:40,680
burt approached me and then i said no i know but hell no and then he went to my wife

764
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:46,360
we're about to have our 46th anniversary and he tried to sweet talk her into this madness

765
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:53,560
and uh she's very thought he was very nice i said no devil speak with forked tongue but what did

766
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:59,240
he do why was he such an evil person oh he was part of that whole group of folks this he was

767
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:04,200
like he's passed away but he was part of the same kind of group that people like colonel alexander

768
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:09,400
and alessandro they're all part of that whole operation they have different roles but his role

769
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:16,840
was to interface from that black illegal program world with the ufo subculture back then this is

770
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:28,520
like 33 years ago right um so so psychological information manipulation trying to trying to

771
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,480
handle the con the perception the public perception of this stuff in the united states

772
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:38,520
is basically what he wanted you to help him do yes but also be part of that operational team is

773
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:44,120
what i think um in terms of these capabilities because he knew that we had done he approached

774
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:50,360
me right after there was proof that our ce5 contact had worked and there are these four et

775
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:58,840
craft that appeared here in florida up outside pensacola so that is when he surfaced uh exactly

776
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:03,320
then now of course everyone makes fun of us for doing that oh it's ouija board stuff i said like

777
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:08,760
the hell it is you think you think these civilizations are using your iphone you know why would they be

778
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:14,840
using 20th century and early 21st century communications technologies they're using stuff

779
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:19,960
like elon would like to do musk would like to do with neural link except without the wires right

780
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:27,880
not the speed of light at speed of thought like that right instant so that program has been in

781
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:34,440
development for decades but it reached the level of success let's call it i mean if you can call

782
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:39,880
hijacking et craft and then blowing them out of the sky with electromagnetic pulse weapons

783
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:46,040
which are illegal by the way i just can't get over two billion dollars you're a better man than me

784
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:50,840
now well i might have been i might have been doing it i would have saluted and been a psyop

785
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,440
fucking head of psyops i'm not interested in that

786
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:00,360
look you know i mean i'm not rich but i'm comfortable as a doctor i don't need that

787
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:04,760
and i've never had aspirations for that yeah and yeah i say i say it all the time

788
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:10,680
whether people in the comments who think think i'm a i'm cia funded podcast if the cia wants to offer

789
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:16,600
me a million bucks i'm sign me up well that's the joke i mean you know i i bootstrapped this whole

790
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:23,400
effort for 35 years with a handful of people and no office and you know a couple you know some

791
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:29,320
volunteers and one and a half staff members and my wife and me so i said oh yeah if i were at

792
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:34,600
you know if i were that guy do you ever i wouldn't be uh i wouldn't be doing this you know do you

793
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:39,000
ever think back like just laying in bed late at night be like god damn it maybe i should have

794
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,440
taken that two billion dollars never never because then you're you're that you're owned

795
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:50,920
you're you're an owned asset i value my freedom i value my freedom or i value all the money on

796
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:55,480
earth did he did he offer in payments or was it like an upfront lump sum no the way he described

797
01:20:55,480 --> 01:21:01,960
is that after the cold war ended and the soviet union was falling apart in the late 80s early

798
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:06,280
90s that they had seized a bunch of assets in eastern europe and they had a slush fund

799
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,520
and that i would have control and access of that and it was a lot of money um and look the kind

800
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:19,080
of black budget money these guys have it's enormous there's another guy who told me in 93

801
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:26,200
a couple months for a brief ci director and he was technically involved with the ufo subculture

802
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:32,840
but he was a tech guy who was embedded with this shadow government and he said look we have given

803
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:39,800
at least 10 000 people 10 million dollars a piece or more to secure their cooperation with what we're

804
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:45,800
doing and then he made another offer to me and this was about a year and a half after general

805
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:51,640
stubble bind so i said no thank you i don't want to go that route i want to stay independent and

806
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:59,400
free but um and i would imagine the disinfo people they probably target media personalities

807
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,600
they probably target podcasts maybe you know if they're still doing if they're still i mean

808
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:06,840
imagine what they were doing with richard doty in like what was it the 70s 80s yeah with paul

809
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:12,360
benowitz and and the level they went to to go to these ufo conferences and try to get these people

810
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:16,520
and say hey i'm going to give you some secrets if you just go out there and get us some intel on

811
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:20,120
these people and meanwhile the secrets they're giving them are like half-baked bullshit have you

812
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:25,320
ever seen the documentary unacknowledged that we did it's had about 800 900 million people i don't

813
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:31,000
think i've seen that one though i watched serious um unacknowledged is the one that prompted them to

814
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:37,400
shove elizando out into the public from his counterintelligence operation at the pentagon

815
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:43,080
it's it's had well over 800 million people see it and in that we interview

816
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:50,040
mr doty and he admits to carrying bags of cash to people oh yes i have seen this i've seen this

817
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:54,280
clip and he also admits that there were abduction programs that we were doing but then he got really

818
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:59,000
scared i said i can't talk about that right but i have multiple people who confirm that now we also

819
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:06,120
have a book in 92 that shock valet wrote who's a very you know well-known researcher on this

820
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:13,080
he's an astronomer astrophysicist i think and he admits to having a document from the cia from

821
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:20,600
1985 shock valet and go look at it this is in the briefing where he admits that this document he

822
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:25,480
has he won't release that i think he's been threatened and it talks about the agency the

823
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:33,640
cia going down to argentina and brazil abducting peasants making it look like aliens were abducting

824
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:40,120
them using these advanced technology systems for it's and i'm quoting their psychological warfare

825
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:48,760
value so imagine how easy it's like taking candy from a baby in the amateur ufo research subculture

826
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:54,520
to stage this stuff and get everyone to twitter talking about how the aliens did x y and z and

827
01:23:54,520 --> 01:24:00,040
there's staging it's called stagecraft i know what the technologies are i've i have debriefed

828
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:06,440
people who are operational on the man-made ufos doing it the cattle mutilations have nothing to

829
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:13,240
do with ets it's all yes that we can prove so the project gasbury or something were they were they

830
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:20,360
detonated in the 70s they detonated a subterranean nuke and they had uh helicopters going out and

831
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,280
basically is this is correct where they were mutilating cattle and they were trying to

832
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:28,200
they were doing surgical operations and taking out certain parts of the cattle the tongue

833
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:35,640
the glands and trying to determine whether they had been infected with this sort of radiation

834
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:40,040
whether the food and the crops and the cattle had been infected with this stuff well that's one

835
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:44,760
operation there's another operation to get substrate material biological growth material

836
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:51,400
right for their little weird gray and other reptilian looking the man-made ets right

837
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:57,160
because some of them are not just robotic some are but the more advanced ones are sort of what

838
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:02,920
they call a bio nano machine so they have a biological and a technological component but

839
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:10,120
they're man-made um and people go this is sounds too far out i said but wait imagine what kind of

840
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:16,600
you know if you have that kind of mad scientist mentality it's like dr strangelove and you've got

841
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:23,720
the virtually limitless funding black budget and otherwise criminal organ drug running everything

842
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:30,680
yeah and you've got et technologies that you're studying for decades you're going to come be able

843
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:36,920
to come out with a whole constellation of dirty tricks right people it's so interesting to detangle

844
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:41,720
this stuff well that's my job it's to try to make sense out of this madness and from my

845
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:46,120
understanding of the cattle mutilation is the atomic energy commission like when they when they

846
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:51,320
did that um i think it was in 67 where they detonated the subterranean nuke to find natural

847
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:59,480
gas reserves in dulce new mexico um what they did was they the cattle mutilation was like a

848
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:04,920
monitoring program to assess radiation leakage in the ecosystem or whatever and at the same time

849
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:10,120
they were doing they were testing some of this exotic aircraft over the same location the people

850
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:15,240
started to think oh my god these aircraft are are doing this to the cattle it's aliens so they said

851
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:18,920
oh the people are saying that we're going to keep flying our aircraft over those cattle testing

852
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:25,560
mutilation the deals so that was like to an insane level of well that's public perception

853
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:30,840
but that's common and then all you have to do is have someone write you know an alien harvest like

854
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:38,280
you have people write abduction books and what's interesting the very people who are setting this up

855
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:44,360
will guide those victims and they are victims i'm not saying these abduction people aren't real they

856
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:51,320
have been victimized but they haven't been taken by extraterrestrials they've been taken by covert

857
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:59,400
human special operations made to look alien right so it's a look-alike right so those programs uh

858
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:06,760
uh they sell and the media which is as corrupt as anything you can imagine the legacy media

859
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:12,440
uh you know a lot of those people they're you know like i will be absolutely not only shadow

860
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:17,320
banned but banned to tell the truth on a lot of media whereas if you're going forward telling a

861
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:24,600
lie boom you're on 60 minutes boom you're on that's true because the big media is i think

862
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:30,200
probably more corrupt than any other institution in the united states or the world yeah and being

863
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:35,000
controlled by these interests yeah but how do they i understand how the media is controlled

864
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,320
by advertising dollars but how are how do you think they're controlled by these

865
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:46,440
rogue military aerospace companies money and control pay their back door and money to them

866
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:52,360
they're knocks they're they have a non-official cover you know by day and public persona they're

867
01:27:52,360 --> 01:28:00,520
a media person they're actually working with the agency or some other entity that's part of this

868
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:06,040
compartmented shadow government and you know i know people like that i mean probably if i had

869
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:11,720
taken the money i would have been one of those guys right yeah so um you know that's how that

870
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:19,080
works and it makes one of the problems with washington is everyone's so busy doing a million

871
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:24,680
different things you know they have 99 things to do every day and and this thing as you pointed

872
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:31,560
out the beginning and you're right is a it's a such a confusing mess of conflicting information

873
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:37,240
yeah that they just go i don't want to hear it is too complicated right but that is part of the

874
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:42,040
reason they've made it complicated it's obfuscating it hides it yeah exactly by making it just

875
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:46,600
incomprehensible it's impossible to know what's real so we have to make it understandable and

876
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,200
i liken this to like you know the epiphany moment in the wizard of oz when darthi and

877
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:57,240
whoever the scarecrow and they pull back the curtain and there's this old crud mudgeon pulling

878
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:02,040
the levers right yeah that's what this is so you know part of what we have to do is not just say

879
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:09,400
here's the evidence for nhi craft and people extraterrestrial craft and people but here's

880
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:15,080
the other part of it here's the dominant information disinformation that's out in

881
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:21,320
ufology in the media in documentaries in films and books has actually been staged by the very

882
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:27,240
people trying to keep it secret yeah so that you're looking over here and not the truth yeah and

883
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:32,680
they're very good at doing this danny they're extremely good at one of my favorite stories

884
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:37,640
was from annie jacobson in her area 51 book where she interviewed the cia pilots who are test flying

885
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:42,680
the first jet planes over the air force base and they said they they purposely brought gorilla

886
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:47,880
masks in the cockpit for in the chance that they flew by a civilian aircraft they put the gorilla

887
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:52,440
mask on so that they're just they're poisoning that story already so if the guy goes to the bar

888
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:58,680
later because dude i saw a monkey flying a jet plane well and and the early abductions in the

889
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:06,520
late 50s early 60s they had the man-made ufos that and they had some guys very short stature

890
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:10,920
were not quite looking normal and they're kind of like hollywood you can make a guy look like

891
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:17,560
darth vader or whatever that they had that stagecraft and it was incredibly convincing

892
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:22,760
because even now now you look at one of our witness witnesses who whistleblowers who came

893
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:31,080
forward a year and a half ago steven digna he was at fort irwin california in 2000 and he was

894
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:36,040
called out by some raytheon guys to look at some objects that were out over the range and they had

895
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:41,880
to cancel their live fire exercises because of this and it was a triangular not quite

896
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:49,720
equilateral more of a pointed triangular craft and they didn't know he picked up a pair of night

897
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:55,640
vision scopes and he looked at it he saw the detail on it and then he saw that there were

898
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:02,360
several others that were holographic projections of the real one and so it looked like there was a

899
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:08,200
fleet of them yeah and this is how you stage a fake alien attack yeah they they had this this

900
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:12,760
was all part of that declassified northwoods thing where they were trying to stage a fake invasion

901
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:19,160
over cuba well no this was a separate incident but it's very similar to that it's very similar and

902
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:26,280
and so they were very upset that he figured that out right and the raytheon guys few days later

903
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:32,840
abducted him and his wife on coming back from a movie back to the base on this road out in

904
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:39,640
california remote road and if anyone who would have seen that craft and what happened would have

905
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:48,440
sworn it was a alien vehicle and his raytheon now he suffered terrible damages he's very damaged he's

906
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:57,000
very sick so you know that is what happens if you get too close to the truth and he's an incredibly

907
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:02,200
sweet man very courageous he's totally telling the truth but i would say if you took a million

908
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:08,520
people on earth and showed them that craft that that raytheon object craft in 2000 is 25 years

909
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:13,640
ago right right i don't think one person would think that it was man-made and this is a problem

910
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:19,400
for the national security council and the president because everyone assumes

911
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:27,000
that what i'm telling you they know they don't if you've seen the documentary unacknowledged

912
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:32,600
you know more about this subject than virtually anyone in the u.s congress except the bad apples

913
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:37,080
who are on the payroll of the shadow secret government right well so so this is a problem

914
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:43,720
i mean if you want to live in a in a free society in a democracy you can't have something this

915
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:50,440
important you know completely ignored by your elected officials right and also the benefit

916
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:54,840
of having so much bullshit out there is is if the truth does get out it doesn't fucking matter

917
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:58,520
because there's what's the what are the chances that they're going to pick that as being the truth

918
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:03,640
well that's that's now you're very smart because you just hit the nail in the coffin what keeps me

919
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:09,560
up at night um is and that's why i don't trust any of these whistleblowers because i don't i

920
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:16,840
don't think well i i know the ones i know and and uh now here's someone like like mr grush

921
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:22,760
he was telling 100 the truth until he started telling tall tales that were being fed to him

922
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:29,320
by lou alazando right about how the aliens had blown up villages and i don't know south america

923
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:35,000
or someplace that was alazando told him that yeah so he fell into that disinformation trap

924
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:41,160
along with the information trap but a lot of people do that and why because those guys will

925
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:48,280
say hey i can get you a 10 million dollar book or movie deal and i i can get you on 60 minutes so

926
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:55,720
you know there are advantages to going with those folks as opposed to doing it let's call it clean

927
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:01,880
because doing it clean is a hard path i mean you know i you know it's been a big struggle for me

928
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:10,440
and my family and you know you have all kinds of problems because of it but i don't regret it

929
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:17,640
i mean i wouldn't do anything different at all but it's a dangerous and it's very ungratifying

930
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
from a personal point of view nobody would do it except i feel that this is something

931
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:29,960
if this doesn't get resolved properly what verner von brown warned about right he said look the whole

932
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:36,280
plan is to stage an alien threat so we can unite the world around this sort of fascist

933
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:42,520
totalitarian militaristic sort of thing it's like the movie independence day right and we'll say

934
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:48,840
let's go kick alien butt you see the arabs and everybody in the world united to fight the aliens

935
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:55,960
so that's all right at a cia psyops scripting and guess what 99 percent of legacy ufology

936
01:34:55,960 --> 01:35:01,400
that's the narrative there are the good aliens and the bad ones and the so star wars right it's

937
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:07,240
it's all that narrative and i go you at least members of congress are saying look if these

938
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:12,440
civilizations were hostile given that their technologies are hundreds of thousands of

939
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:17,560
years more advanced than ours we'd be gone we'd be a charcoal briquette floating through space

940
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:25,240
now do they have this is not to say i'm not naive this is not to say that those civilizations

941
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:32,040
don't have some self-interest because what would you think i mean just put yourself in the shoes

942
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:41,320
and through the eyes of an et you come across this planet and in a few decades it goes from

943
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:48,280
you know muskets and machine guns to thermonuclear weapons to the heads of each other to very

944
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:54,600
advanced electromagnetic weapons including the so-called scalar ones that are knocking et craft

945
01:35:54,600 --> 01:36:01,560
now and then the same group going off the reservation of any controls reverse engineers

946
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:09,160
your et technologies and start using it against you got it that's the crisis that no one's talking

947
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:14,760
about because and and you know jake and people like him will say you know it's at the point now

948
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:22,840
where they just say at the advanced technologies humans have to most people on earth would be

949
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:29,560
indistinguishable from an et vehicle or nhi craft and there's a big risk there because number one

950
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:36,440
they could stage a false flag attack and everyone think it was alien which is what their plan is

951
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:40,040
that's what the drones were all about by the way i mean mr trump got that wrong

952
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:44,760
when his press secretary commented on that we we know what that was that was that was that was a

953
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:52,360
psyop it was a psyop hundred percent by coordinated by who by the same people who are trying to be

954
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:59,800
sure that when this comes out this year and next that it's done in a with the specter of fear

955
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:04,520
we don't know people look at the skies oh i'm afraid they look just like hobby drones like

956
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:09,000
they looked like they weren't they weren't moving crazy at all no i have no i know a team that was

957
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:15,000
under contract with lockheed martin that has some images of some of this stuff and some of them are

958
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:22,760
pretty amazing and some of the daytime ones that they've captured now they're not extraterrestrial

959
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:29,640
they're our advanced stuff but again and some have said well these are originated from china

960
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:36,680
but that's a misnomer because this shadow government entity is transnational

961
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:42,200
you can label whatever country you want it doesn't matter it operates you know when i was the first

962
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:48,760
time i went to meet with this the latest efforts about three years ago at the senate intelligence

963
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:55,000
committee skiff and i went in there and i said see that map of the world erase all the geopolitical

964
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:00,440
boundaries like the boundary between canada united states or mongolia and china or whatever

965
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:08,840
yeah this organization the world is their oyster they they don't care about that so now the truth

966
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:14,680
is people like jake barber and his guys are patriots who got stuck in that system as i said

967
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:23,160
and they deserve a clean path out a safe path out and that's what has to happen that's got to

968
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:29,960
happen from the congress and from the president's executive orders which i've seen some drafts of

969
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:35,320
those and and so yeah and they're and they're in here their recommendations are in here

970
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:40,280
for for what those need to be and they need to be done yesterday we kind of just got really

971
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:45,160
sidetracked down a crazy rabbit hole after we started talking about jake and michael

972
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:50,680
Herrera's situation where they were extracting these people out yeah and he's the only guy who

973
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:57,080
i've ever heard about who saw something like that and was not killed really only survived his guys

974
01:38:57,080 --> 01:39:03,640
yes absolutely it's a miracle he wasn't killed i told him that i said you have no idea how rare

975
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:09,480
it is for someone like you a kid 20 years old seeing something like that for them not to just

976
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:16,040
erase you you know so yeah i remember from that story jake was like saying the guys were saying

977
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:19,480
should we smoke these guys should we smoke these guys blah blah and they ended up not doing that

978
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,840
so they're taking these children from foreign countries these underdeveloped places

979
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:34,440
and adults and adults but the the primary reason is because they are out of a civilized

980
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:40,200
they're not in like a metropolitan city they're not around technology all the time

981
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:46,520
they're in a completely native environment and they're eating i don't know maybe unprocessed

982
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:51,320
foods natural foods so they're more connected to nature somehow and that somehow makes them more

983
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:56,760
in tuned to this psychic consciousness the psionic stuff that he's talking about and

984
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:02,760
they put them in this program give them dopamine drugs and hook them up to all kinds of technology

985
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:09,800
and use them to summon these eggs this is what he said summon the eggs well not just the eggs

986
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:15,560
it's all different types of craft and but it's not it's more than just summon okay so let me

987
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:21,320
be a little let me unpack this a little more okay years ago you heard about this weird looking drone

988
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:26,120
that kind of looked like a ufo that the iranians were able to break into its guidance system and

989
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:31,640
land and then study to reverse engineer it i never heard about this oh it's all in the media so but

990
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:37,560
if you look into that now maybe you can find it what year i can't remember iranian iranian drone

991
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:43,080
that was caught that was no hours that they intercepted and hijacked it basically by wire

992
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:48,920
iran did yes and landed it at a base in iran and then studied the reverse engineer you gotta find

993
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:55,160
this shit dude yeah but that it it was a drone it was not a ufo right it was looked weird it was a

994
01:40:55,160 --> 01:41:03,160
very unusual shape and uh now imagine being able to do that with this instead of guide by wire

995
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:08,200
right right there u.s drone recovered by iran 2011 i'm sure there have been multiple here we go

996
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:15,160
yeah see what a strange looking one sophisticated spy planes u.s intelligence is spying intensely

997
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:20,440
on iranian sites believed to be developing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles

998
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:27,640
bob oar tells us an unmanned u.s drone did vanish over the weekend the secret stealth drone

999
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:32,600
nicknamed the beast of kandahar is one of america's most sophisticated intelligence tools

1000
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:38,920
for the past four years the rq-170 has flown high altitude surveillance missions over the

1001
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:45,160
battlefields in afghanistan okay so here's my point in this is that this is this sort of nonsense

1002
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:54,280
happens all the time yeah um what my point of it is they were able to break into the encrypted

1003
01:41:54,280 --> 01:42:00,680
hardened guidance system because these are all flown a lot of them out of nellis from a or bases

1004
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:04,840
out in the desert underground and they're unmanned but they're on the other side of the world

1005
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:10,920
so but they were able to break into that system yeah the command and control guidance and land it

1006
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:14,840
they didn't crash now did they do that with this consciousness stuff no no they didn't i'm using

1007
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:20,680
this as an analogy if i can get through my sentence so that's an analogy now imagine having an

1008
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:27,720
interstellar vehicle an hi craft and their technologies are consciousness thought interfacing

1009
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:34,520
so you train these people to basically hack into their guidance system when no one's looking and

1010
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:41,240
you hijack it instead of landing it you bring it over to an area sometimes you can land the et craft

1011
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:47,240
but often what they do is they hit it with an electromagnetic pulse weapon and it either is

1012
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:53,320
disabled and falls to the ground or it's blown to pieces now what i was getting ready to tell you is

1013
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:59,960
that in these same areas they'll put up a tfr which is basically a you know a temporary flight

1014
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:09,720
restriction area over an area of space airspace if there is a civilian aircraft that strays into

1015
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:15,960
that and they're wanting and they're using these electromagnetic pulse weapons they will blow the

1016
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:24,840
innocent civilian cessna out of the sky and i know this for a fact sometimes the electromagnetic

1017
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:32,840
pulse goes outside the tfr and hits a totally a aircraft that was trying to stay out of the tfr

1018
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:39,240
so now we have over at continental united states a real threat to air traffic which are always

1019
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:45,800
blaming it on the aliens no the real threat to air traffic are the man-made ufos and these

1020
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:51,400
sort of operations that work because these are not always done over permanent flight restriction

1021
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:57,080
areas like a top secret air force base they're done in these other places right so this is a

1022
01:43:57,080 --> 01:44:02,200
real problem i brought it up to officials in washington and what's astounding to me i want to

1023
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:09,800
vent a little bit here you know i've been blowing the whistle on this nonsense since 93 and you

1024
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:17,800
always wonder i think we have something called the fbi or law enforcement now we can prove through

1025
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:28,040
our direct witnesses kidnapping murder treason killing innocent civilians like i just described

1026
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:34,040
embezzlement of u.s federal dollars into black projects without oversight and oversight of the

1027
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:41,320
president or congress on and on half the federal penal code has been is being violated by this

1028
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:48,360
organization and it's precisely where is the congress and the white house and the fbi so now

1029
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:52,760
that we have a new administration and a new congress and this is all beginning to come out

1030
01:44:53,720 --> 01:45:00,600
i think that the public listening either contact their senators and house member and and the white

1031
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:06,040
house and say look we need to get this resolved but you need to enforce the law and protect

1032
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:13,160
you know the american democracy but also the american public and that's not happening yet

1033
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:20,280
and so that group goes unchecked while these terrible atrocities keep going now what i would

1034
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:27,720
like to see happen is that those operations get wound down peacefully because there's a as i

1035
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:34,520
mentioned earlier a glide path out to basically transform that mess into something that's forward

1036
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:39,880
looking and i think all the whistleblowers i know that's what they want to see you know because

1037
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:45,720
an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind and if you go kinetic if you go into a violent

1038
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:54,600
confrontation with an organization that have assets that are way beyond anything as adamor

1039
01:45:54,600 --> 01:46:01,080
wilson said that they can deploy it's not going to be good yeah because you're like like it's a

1040
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:05,880
suicide mission what would it be like to go to war with one of these i know exactly and now i'm

1041
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:13,000
advising a group that has been asked to do exactly that if it comes to it and and i don't want to

1042
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:18,440
talk about detail operational details about it a military a u.s military group i won't talk about

1043
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:25,560
what agency or what entity it is okay but it's a sap it's tsci top secret special compartment

1044
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:31,320
information and i've been asked to provide everything i can and i will and i have been i've

1045
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:37,240
been doing this for 30 some years but now we have a critical mass of people who have details i mean

1046
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:43,720
talked about some of the whistleblowers that are still behind the curtain that could be brought in

1047
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:50,600
and who who know of multiple places there was one gentleman who was about to come forward and

1048
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:56,600
he got threatened but he was read into 18 unacknowledged special access projects dealing

1049
01:46:56,600 --> 01:47:04,200
with this he had baseline clearance across 18 of them in a top secret pentagon office so

1050
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:10,120
we have people like that they're living they need to be protected he's afraid of not only being

1051
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:16,120
killed but his pension being erased because he signed an 80-year nondisclosure agreement

1052
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:22,440
that said that if he ever discussed any of this that he would lose his freedom but also his pension

1053
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:30,440
and he's getting up in years he has some more injuries he's a hero and i can't you know what i

1054
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:36,520
never do is just shove someone like that out i mean i am a doctor so it's like a doctor patient

1055
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:43,720
confidentiality but at a certain point the people who can protect people like him have a

1056
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:51,960
legal obligation i will say that given what is in here that the unredacted part what people can get

1057
01:47:51,960 --> 01:48:00,520
is the has redacted like this guy's name's redacted but there is a dereliction of duty here if they

1058
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:05,640
don't deal with this and i think the american public they need to hear i've had so many members

1059
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:09,720
of congress in the senate say we really need to hear from our constituents on this right

1060
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:14,760
now people are so apathetic they just think everything happens by itself no it doesn't

1061
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:19,880
you got to create a movement so i'm sort of an activist that way you got to have people say look

1062
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:27,080
we want this resolved we want this fixed yesterday but we also want to bring out the technologies

1063
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:32,280
that would save the biosphere and eliminate poverty so imagine i don't think the things

1064
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:36,920
that are flying at 200 000 miles per hour should come out right now that are man-made because

1065
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:41,880
that's a missile delivery system you don't want every terrorist in mogadishu having that to boom

1066
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:48,680
do something in over downtown la but the things that would sit on your table here and run this

1067
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:53,960
building from what's called the zero point or quantum vacuum energy that needs to come out

1068
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:59,480
and that would then give us a civilization without pollution and without poverty within

1069
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:04,760
and certainly your lifetime maybe not mine because i'm almost 70 in june but

1070
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:10,840
there would be an amazing leap forward and so i think my four daughters and 12 grandkids would

1071
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:17,880
actually have a planet to live on instead of it just being ruined by these 1800s technologies

1072
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:24,280
we're using you know so that is the big piece of it and let's call that the big piece dividend of

1073
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:30,520
this all coming out danny is that imagine a civilization without pollution and where your

1074
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:36,760
energy needs are met without cost once you have a be like a heat pump or something smaller right

1075
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:42,680
provide all the energy for your car or your business or your house and with no bill no

1076
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:47,400
electric bill the the problem with that this is what patrick david said the other day to me he

1077
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:53,160
said no one wants that to come out because there goes trillions of dollars in assets right all the

1078
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:58,840
public utilities don't need them all the oil gas coal nuclear power don't need them right an electric

1079
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:04,840
plug-in car like a tesla don't need it sure so well you could use the electric motor part but

1080
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:09,720
those you know 900 pounds of lithium ion batteries so the idea is like don't need it right right

1081
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:15,320
conventional transportation and petroleum industries that prop up our economy are going

1082
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:21,000
to be all of a sudden irrelevant if we have some crazy zero point anti-gravity technology

1083
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,080
well again the anti-gravity technology really can't come out right yet but the other can

1084
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:30,840
zero point energy zero point what i call the station the basically a power plant that generates

1085
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:36,280
energy but you don't want something that's flying at that kind of maneuverability in the hands of

1086
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:41,960
unstable failed states and whatnot now i always point out to people the worst people in the world

1087
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:48,200
have that technology now because these are rogue shadow government operators that are doing all

1088
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:52,680
these terrible things and i think they have more terrible things they're planning to do

1089
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:58,040
which i don't want to go into but i think we ain't seen nothing yet from that crowd

1090
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:04,920
i wanted to ask you about roswell specifically because i've talked to annie jacobson about

1091
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:07,560
roswell and she wrote about it in her book i'm sure you're familiar with what she said there

1092
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:13,320
was an e g and g engineer that was a source for her and he told her that it was a craft

1093
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:22,920
piloted by remote-controlled by the soviet union and it had deformed children in there that were

1094
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:30,520
surgically altered by mengele or the nazi mengela mengela yeah and it was crashed here to basically

1095
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:35,960
sow chaos and she asked him she's like why the hell wouldn't you say this this would make them

1096
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:40,440
look terrible and it would be great for us if we you know were able to expose this and they would

1097
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:47,000
be completely humiliated on the world stage and he said because we started doing the same exact

1098
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:52,680
thing that they were doing well i'm not so sure of that because we have interviewed people who

1099
01:51:52,680 --> 01:52:01,080
are now deceased who handle the bodies and they most certainly were not that so now have there

1100
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:07,000
been events like that yes and we've confirmed that russia and probably china have these same

1101
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:13,560
technologies and have they done stagecraft and hoax things very likely but see a one source

1102
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:19,800
account i know the e g and g folks one of the g's is greer i'm not related just on the record

1103
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:24,040
but you know i you know again a one source

1104
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:32,360
no but you know and if you look at the the the people who were there at the

1105
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:40,280
retrieval site of the one that was not blown to smithereens that was no man-made object but

1106
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:46,040
you know and in 1947 the only thing we had that would have been

1107
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:54,520
electro-gravitic were ones that were unstable so the the what was called the disc that we brought

1108
01:52:54,520 --> 01:53:01,240
over from nazi germany at the end of the war that was not stable and if you look at some of the old

1109
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:08,120
home movies and you see it looks like they're like falling like a leaf like this those are early

1110
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:13,240
man-made ones that had didn't have the gyro let's say or the stable they had not mastered the

1111
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:23,480
gravity control that was 54 late 1954 so those craft would it would be very not that stable

1112
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:27,720
but they were man-made but if you look on the inside of them you know like the what's called

1113
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:33,080
the arv that brad sorensen saw yeah and mark mccandless who's passed away

1114
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:43,800
illustrated for us and got the sort of good concept of the schematics all the interior

1115
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:52,360
components and this is late 50s early 60s were mercury era components when you looked at it

1116
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:56,200
now it was electro-gravitic it had gone out in the space before we land on the moon

1117
01:53:56,840 --> 01:54:02,760
but it wasn't interstellar and certainly if it came to ground it would be obvious it was man-made

1118
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:10,600
components like right away so i point out to people one of the big confusions here is and

1119
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:18,280
it makes it easy once you understand there's the man-made and there's the non-human et but if you

1120
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:25,160
don't and in here is a number of craft that are illustrated and they're side by side where you see

1121
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:31,560
a man-made one versus an et one yeah but i will say can i see that one well it's i'd have to flow

1122
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:38,120
we'd be flipping around but was so was roswell man-made or was it et that the one that's the

1123
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:45,080
famous case and i think there may have been some cover cases that are mixed up the 1945 white sands

1124
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:51,880
event and that roswell event were et there were obviously if you're out in that area this is where

1125
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:57,960
you would be testing your prototype so if we already had remember the b phil brown effect from

1126
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:05,320
the 1920s to 40s and then we get the nazi disc that was brought over by the billionaire paul

1127
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:13,160
melon and general patten and alan dullis and it was a lot more advanced anything we had in terms

1128
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:21,240
of gravity stability so and that's 45 so you can imagine in the 40s into the early 50s there had

1129
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:26,120
been a number of these that would malfunction go down they wouldn't want people to know that we're

1130
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:32,040
working on that technology and they would be loved for people to think it was alien or et right so i

1131
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:38,520
think that again when you start getting into this sort of puzzle palace of of information disinformation

1132
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:43,400
you have to first have a sort of a guidebook you know i liken this to being a doctor and having

1133
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:50,280
what we call differential diagnosis so you know someone comes in with chest pain so a stupid

1134
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:54,280
doctor is gonna say oh it's automatically a heart attack when it could be dozens of things it could

1135
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:59,080
be a dissecting thoracic aneurysm it could be pleurisy it could be a pulmonary embolus it could

1136
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:06,600
be a strain muscle so i i think what's happening with the with the ufo subculture they try to make

1137
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:12,920
everything one thing and it isn't it's several things going on simultaneously and being mixed

1138
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:18,920
up deliberately by very masterful counterintelligence and disinformation folks

1139
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:25,240
yeah and they're very good at it i want to talk about the disinformation stuff and the

1140
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:29,080
elizabeth stuff i got to get leak real quick so we'll pause real quick yeah we'll be right back

1141
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:31,960
absolutely all right we're back um

1142
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:39,880
sorry i can't let we gotta i gotta ask you that again you we were just talking about um with the

1143
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:46,120
quiet zone in west virginia and how you do the ce5 protocols and you said you let the ets know

1144
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:52,440
that the earth is armed right one of the protocols if you if you get the app it's ce5 contact app

1145
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:57,960
i can get it uh in part of the training and when we're doing these sort of

1146
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:05,560
sai remote viewing contact we let them know that they should only appear in any way that is safe

1147
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:12,440
and appropriate for that time place and group and that the earth has a lot of systems that

1148
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:18,120
can pick them up when they come out of let's call it transdimensional space time into 3d

1149
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:24,120
so if you're an uh let's say you're an et craft you could be totally invisible to all sensors

1150
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:30,840
because you're you can shift let's say the resonant frequency uh of that whole craft

1151
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:37,800
and everyone i can shift out of this dimension into a very higher frequency so it's not 3d but

1152
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:41,720
then it can pop into 3d this is why people see them materialize and dematerialize

1153
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:50,440
and when they're in the non-3d form so they're not solid yeah you're not going to be able to

1154
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:55,960
strike them and down them as easily right this is why we have so many weird phenomenon you know

1155
01:57:55,960 --> 01:58:03,320
it's funny the cia has a term wsfm it stands for weird science and freaking magic an engineer

1156
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:08,840
knew it norther grumman just calls it pure fucking magic pfm and so when you start getting into

1157
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:14,840
either the high end of the electronics that are man-made or the interstellar extraterrestrial

1158
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:20,920
manifestations and phenomenon you're dealing with some very strange stuff right and you would

1159
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:27,800
expect that but it's not what people expect uh when they usually get introduced to this idea so

1160
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:33,960
we tell we make it very clear to these visitors that you know there are satellites that have what

1161
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:40,280
are called neutrino light detectors on them that started in the 70s uh they can pick them up when

1162
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:47,320
they drop out of let's call it transdimensional higher frequency yeah into 3d yeah boom it's a

1163
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:54,040
signature so there's a neutrino light scatter that happens and there are earth-based sensors

1164
01:58:54,040 --> 01:59:00,280
they're space-based and aircraft and so they'll pick these objects up and then they'll then

1165
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:07,720
triangulate them and hit them with one of these electromagnetic or scalar weapons so because we're

1166
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:12,520
doing this it's very different from what was going on that jake barber talked about yeah we're not

1167
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:18,520
luring them over so we can hit them and kill them and reverse engineer their stuff we're doing it as

1168
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:25,960
sort of a uh ambassadors as it will as civilian ambassadors from humans to them so for peaceful

1169
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:32,840
contact we're not doing it to get rich quick and make another widget so are there beings inside

1170
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:40,360
these things yes not all of them i mean some are unmanned and some have the equivalent of a android

1171
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:47,320
drone uh that's et because you know they know how dangerous earth is and don't like

1172
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:57,720
my brain just thinks like wouldn't these beings that are so advanced transdimensional ets don't

1173
01:59:57,720 --> 02:00:03,160
they have better things to do than to interface with a couple people that are meditating in the

1174
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:08,840
middle of nowhere no they don't because if they're assigned to do something about the situation here

1175
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:13,480
they need a point of contact right i mean stop for a minute the reason i started this whole

1176
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:19,160
project in 1990 was not the disclosure project that was an accidental outgrowth right of the

1177
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:25,400
main project started with ce5 it started with ce5 contact and the reason for that was that i realized

1178
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:31,160
that it was either in complete denial our society our media our most people in the government

1179
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:38,280
or we were targeting them and killing them there was no one on the earth setting up let's call it

1180
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:45,480
a peaceful outreach that would be let's say an ambassador level where you're just willing to be

1181
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:53,960
someone who does this out of goodwill to establish the beginnings of a relationship between humans

1182
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:59,480
and these other civilizations and i realized no one was doing that and so that's why i started

1183
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:05,000
this whole organization in 1990 it was not to do the disclosure project i kind of got dragged

1184
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:13,160
kicking and screaming into that once i realized that you know like most people they think that

1185
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:16,920
the president and the congress are in control of all these covert programs and they know what's

1186
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:23,400
going on when i realized that how dangerous this organization is that was had gone completely off

1187
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:28,920
the leash of any oversight that's when i started doing the disclosure project but that's not what

1188
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:34,840
i was mainly interested yeah but you have to warn these trans-dimensional ets that that they have

1189
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:40,920
to be careful for people beaming them out of the sky right well we just do it as just a reminder

1190
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:48,440
because we don't want to be responsible for the loss of life whether it be human or or et so

1191
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:54,040
you know i'm a doctor so above all do no harm right i mean you know the saying that doctors

1192
02:01:54,040 --> 02:02:00,120
supposed to live up to so we don't want to set up a situation and so it's not to say we think

1193
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:05,880
they're they're they're not monitoring this it's just to remind them and also don't be so willing

1194
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:12,600
to do something in this dimension because we're wanting this right because humans are really

1195
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:18,280
wanting the ones that come on these events with me they really want to make there are a lot of

1196
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:23,560
people who are very pure-hearted about it they're not all just jerks right out there we have wonderful

1197
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:29,000
people millions of people who have been doing ce5 now i mean william shatner got it and then

1198
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:34,760
went up in that space thing and all these people and so what we're wanting to do is show these

1199
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:41,080
civilizations there's another side of humanity that isn't a warmongering bunch of jerks wanting

1200
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:48,600
to blow them out of the sky right but who is doing that the state department the un no so i liken this

1201
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:54,520
to back in the cold war when there were physicians for social responsibility who were doctors going

1202
02:02:54,520 --> 02:03:01,240
over to the old soviet union to try to create a rapprochement and a dialogue right this just take

1203
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:08,280
this on cosmic level to where there should be humans reaching out to these civilizations

1204
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:14,760
for not some ulterior motive to get their goodies and get rich or turn them into a weapon system

1205
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:21,800
or blow them out of the sky but because there's an opportunity coming up for humans to be part of

1206
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:27,800
a larger cosmic family or whatever you want to call it so what kind of communication are

1207
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:32,680
you having when you're summoning these beings we don't summon them you see the king of england

1208
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:38,840
would summon a valet what do you call i know jake uses that term and it's appalling you should never

1209
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:44,840
use that what do you use we invite them okay you summon of your you summon your uber driver

1210
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:51,480
right i mean this is disrespectful it's completely disrespectful okay well look look words matter

1211
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:59,240
sure right yes they do matter i agree all right so what are words words are expressions verbally

1212
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:05,320
of the thought and the thought is expression of the consciousness behind it so we do not call or

1213
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:13,080
summon them we invite them with a sense of the equality that exists between all intelligent life

1214
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:18,520
in other words even if they're very different from us they may have much higher iqs more advanced

1215
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:25,880
technologically but at the level of what erwin schrodinger talked about the singularity of mind

1216
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:34,520
of consciousness and that's a universal of constant on that level they're awake we're awake

1217
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:40,280
and so the light of awareness from my eyes yours and ets it's the same because they've done studies

1218
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:45,320
consciousness is in fact a singularity it's not divisible sure we divide it by our egos

1219
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:50,840
right yeah and in reality on a higher level of understanding it's a singularity so that is where

1220
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:58,120
we come together is why our motto is one universe one people that within the universe at that level

1221
02:04:58,120 --> 02:05:03,640
of consciousness and mind we're all one people and so that's why i don't like the term alien

1222
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:09,160
which means foreign right i like the term you know people people say what do you call i saw

1223
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:15,800
they're non-human people they're extraterrestrial people now the trick here and this is where it

1224
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:20,920
gets very complicated for some people is that a lot of people will do something like that

1225
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:29,160
and they'll bump into something from another dimension right like an angel or a demon or

1226
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:34,040
whatever but that's not an extraterrestrial so this is where you get into this you know tucker

1227
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:42,440
carlson oh yeah he got he got gaslit by a lot of these intel folks who told them that the aliens

1228
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:50,840
are demons well the reason he was gaslit was because they were praying on his valid you know

1229
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:57,320
christian beliefs i'm not questioning that at all but this sort of cosmology that is known within

1230
02:05:57,400 --> 02:06:03,960
many traditional circles they wanted to conflate that with alien and it's easy to do because

1231
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:11,880
that is another special operations capability and that is to use very powerful electromagnetic

1232
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:17,800
systems to create phenomenon like you see at skinwalker or bradshaw ranch we know how they're

1233
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:24,040
doing it i know who's doing it i know what the electronics are now there's an innate phenomenon

1234
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:29,080
that was there but then those both sides were taken over by covert human black operations

1235
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:36,200
so this aliens and demons narrative that it seems to be everywhere where is that coming from and

1236
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:41,400
what is the purpose behind it what is the motive of it it is literally to demonize non-human

1237
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:46,840
existence so we can have war see everything tracks at the fear factor yeah right everything

1238
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:54,680
tracks back to how do you are you you're sorry how do you create an enemy right right all right

1239
02:06:54,680 --> 02:07:02,280
so if you're wanting to aggrandize the military industrial super complex on a on a you know

1240
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:08,280
international level the card that has to be eventually played which is what vernon brown

1241
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:13,640
warned about will be this alien threat card and so you can do it in a lot of way if you're talking

1242
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:18,520
to someone who's religious relate it to demons if you're talking to someone who's conventional

1243
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:24,600
geopolitical they're a national security threat or air safety threat right if you want to relate it

1244
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:32,680
whatever it is so they have scripts and narratives to sort of affect and what they do is they do an

1245
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:39,800
analysis of your own psychology and belief system and they target it so and which it was interesting

1246
02:07:40,040 --> 02:07:45,400
i was at the vatican there's a flavor of psy up for everyone yes and it's curated it's tailored

1247
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:50,920
for that um you're at the vatican and i was when i was at the vatican some years ago when pope john

1248
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:55,800
paul was the pope i met with him on senior balduci you may have heard of him he was a

1249
02:07:56,440 --> 02:08:03,720
senior theologian to the pope and very interested in this issue of the ets and ufos and

1250
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:10,440
ironically he was also a demonologist at the vatican he was an exorcist in here a couple

1251
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:14,280
days yeah i mean it was interesting and of course you know not my cup of tea and whatever if i

1252
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:21,400
whatever fires your rockets but uh but i was at his apartments overlooking you know st peters

1253
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:27,560
yeah and he's turned to me he says you know neither demons nor angels require flying saucers

1254
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:35,000
and it was such a quaint succinct way of putting it and i go yeah of course so he was talking about

1255
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:41,640
all this disinformation and fear mongering because that's how you control a populace you have a you

1256
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:48,520
have to create fear yeah and a narrative and then you get people to buy into it two things one have

1257
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:54,520
you seen the shit chris bledsoe does with the with the orbs i've heard of it i'm not that familiar

1258
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:59,400
with it i know he summons orbs the sub summons a bad word he invites the he invites the orbs

1259
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:05,240
yes but he's also been intercepted by jim semivan who's a ci operative exactly this is another thing

1260
02:09:05,240 --> 02:09:10,840
this is crazy there's so many layers to this i know right i i know that he has been the crazy

1261
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:17,960
thing about this guy i had him on the podcast over a year ago and he is somehow able to invite

1262
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:23,160
these orbs which i've personally witnessed with him on the beach a mile away from here me and

1263
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:32,600
steve both we filmed it i have the video he it's it's real but at the same time there's cia in all

1264
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:37,400
row nasa people coming and visiting him and befriending him and going to his kids baseball

1265
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:45,480
game or football games yeah i know and and literally it is almost exactly like the paul

1266
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:53,880
benoist story i agree and and here's the problem anything that is of an extraterrestrial phenomenon

1267
02:09:53,880 --> 02:10:02,760
can be simulated by these covert humans and so all of it the orbs the craft all men are

1268
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:09,800
phenomenon so people are grossly underestimating covert human capabilities which is why

1269
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:17,000
we we go out and when we're doing ce5 contact with a high index of suspicion and skepticism

1270
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:26,040
it's it's like is that et or is that stagecraft because i i know in great detail what those

1271
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:32,680
capabilities are so when and and so someone who hasn't studied that and i have the advantage of

1272
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:36,920
having to brief nearly a thousand of these whistleblowers right been in corporation so

1273
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:41,960
but i think this is why i'm trying to share this with the public as succinctly as i can even

1274
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:46,440
though it's a complicated what my marine buddies call a clusterfuck of of stuff

1275
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:53,320
but it's something that really needs to be unpacked and understood so that people aren't

1276
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:59,400
tricked right so the so any event that happens i always go well you have to have in your

1277
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:05,720
differential diagnosis or in your comparison you know was it something from another dimension

1278
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:12,920
that's not extraterrestrial extraterrestrial or a man-made or a little more complicated subset

1279
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:20,520
man-made extradimensional where you know you could set up a stimulation by a man-made

1280
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:28,040
electronic system that per let's say tickles some other dimension and brings something into

1281
02:11:28,040 --> 02:11:33,640
this dimension humans can do that human covert physicists that i've worked with have done that

1282
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:40,120
so how do you explain this guy being able to bring these light balls around him and bring them

1283
02:11:40,120 --> 02:11:44,280
around and like i was sat on the beach with him and his daughter for like two hours i mean steve

1284
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:50,360
saw this thing that was not a plane out of the came out of the horizon right went that way back

1285
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:54,520
that way and then just fizzled out into nowhere right and he posted he posts these all over his

1286
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:59,240
instagram all the time like that like i understand i don't know see i haven't been with him to be

1287
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:04,040
able to discern yeah you know it's like the old commercials at real or is it memorax but

1288
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:10,520
from their memory steps you know is it it is it endogenous et in other words original et

1289
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:20,840
or is it originating from somebody piggybacking on him right or using that i don't know and so

1290
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:25,480
i don't know the gentleman i'm just saying have you i like have you ever heard anything similar

1291
02:12:25,480 --> 02:12:34,040
to that sure we've had very in fact i was up on our land in virginia near hot springs virginia

1292
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:41,640
i believe it was october and or november and we were up at about three thousand feet and

1293
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:47,480
i was there we had a buddy we made a campfire and i was doing a little meditation and there were

1294
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:54,280
exactly what you described about 15 or 20 of them that emerged and came over and below the crest

1295
02:12:54,920 --> 02:13:00,760
in about a 40 minute period or 30 40 minute period there were more than a dozen

1296
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:07,080
and i'm okay i'm going oh my god they just kept coming but so yeah we have very similar phenomenon

1297
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:14,600
happen yeah but i also know that you can stagecraft that if you're a a special operations

1298
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:19,800
group with with technologies and this is not to try to discourage people from doing ce5 contact

1299
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:26,280
i'm just saying there has to be a higher level of education and understanding we're actually

1300
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:33,560
we're doing a cruise in the caribbean april 6th to the 12th where it's for there's 200 people

1301
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:37,880
be up on this big deck out in the middle of the ocean for a number of nights we're going to

1302
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:43,960
webinar if people want to tune in and we're going to do this whole ce5 contact oh yeah i've never

1303
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:47,720
done it i've always wanted to do it in the middle of the ocean what island oh we're going all over

1304
02:13:47,720 --> 02:13:53,000
it's it's some big cruise liner that we're reserving legit cruise ship yes like 3100 people

1305
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:57,240
but we have 200 and we're going to have the upper deck cordoned off we'll be doing this late at

1306
02:13:57,240 --> 02:14:02,360
night wow it'd be way fun i've never done it it's an experiment we'll see what happens so

1307
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:09,800
i still have so many questions that are still on this topic um number one why do you think

1308
02:14:09,880 --> 02:14:18,280
so many spooks are so interested in him and trying to push this idea encourage him

1309
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:24,840
i honestly don't know i mean i i'm not an expert in that case i don't know the man or his family

1310
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:29,160
well just let's hypothetically let's let's let's say it's somebody else right somebody else who has

1311
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:35,400
some crazy ability right why would those specific people be so interested in a person like that

1312
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:41,560
well because it's the same reason why the psionic operation teams are interested in people who have

1313
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:46,920
the innate capability okay and they want to see what they're doing how they're doing it

1314
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:53,640
they may want to intercept what they're doing and confuse the picture by staging some hoaxed

1315
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:58,440
events with real ones it's not like either or you have to think about how these guys would think

1316
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:05,080
and what that motivation ultimately is i have no idea i just know there's some very bad actors

1317
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:10,120
swirling around the gentleman i'm going to write the name down on this ipad i'm going to show it

1318
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:13,560
to you because i don't want to say this guy's name on the podcast because it'll get this podcast

1319
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:20,040
shadow band and i want to see if you know who he is steve blur it out or don't show it

1320
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:24,360
i can't see it

1321
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:34,360
no you don't know that name no okay no anyway i get shadow banned all the time yeah i know

1322
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:39,480
although you know it's funny i was on a on a conference called a bunch of tech people say oh

1323
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:43,880
that's a myth nobody gets shadow man i said oh it definitely happened it's ridiculous yeah

1324
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:49,160
definitely happens and it happens to the ufo topic which is very odd yeah oh no it's not at all i

1325
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:56,040
mean if you if you think about go back to that 1950 documents the biggest secret in the history

1326
02:15:56,040 --> 02:16:02,360
of the united states exceeding the secrecy of the development the hydrogen bomb so you know the idea

1327
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:09,160
that the high end of the intelligence community trying to keep this secret wouldn't sanitize

1328
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:16,680
information or and the other naivete about most people now is that those interests

1329
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:21,800
are not only penetrating the tech companies in many cases they control those tech companies

1330
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:29,640
that's right think of the corporate nexus it's crazy think about black rock think about well

1331
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:37,720
all right google i don't go too far into google was literally funded and incubated by the cia the

1332
02:16:37,720 --> 02:16:45,240
nsa and darpa that's i know that and so is microsoft crazy yeah completely batshit nuts

1333
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:51,080
when you think of when you go and you realize that sergue had cia nsa people visiting him like

1334
02:16:51,080 --> 02:16:56,760
monthly sure and the technology came straight from darpa like it's like it sounds like such a

1335
02:16:56,760 --> 02:17:01,640
crazy conspiracy no i read this no it makes total sense though yeah no it does it makes total sense

1336
02:17:01,640 --> 02:17:08,520
because if you can have keystroke by keystroke surveillance of everyone right um that's what

1337
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:13,160
they wanted that's what they wanted with microsoft that's what they wanted with the big tech companies

1338
02:17:13,160 --> 02:17:19,160
and ironically the technology for doing that from all accounts much of it was reverse engineered

1339
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:25,640
from et materials but they didn't let out the energy systems that would eliminate poverty and

1340
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:32,520
human suffering and save the biosphere they let the things out that would enable them to have the

1341
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:39,880
uber surveillance state we have today mostly through the private sector and you know if people

1342
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:45,480
said the government were doing these things but instead you click on an i agree on all your tech

1343
02:17:45,480 --> 02:17:52,040
platforms and you're giving the corporate titans who are interfacing with the intelligence community

1344
02:17:52,760 --> 02:17:58,760
carte blanche everything it's like a cutout it is a cutout yeah yeah it's you know it's to anyone

1345
02:17:58,760 --> 02:18:05,240
who really analyzes this it's obvious um and and that's another question about you know our

1346
02:18:05,240 --> 02:18:11,640
freedoms and privacy and much of the constitutional protections right and i keep coming back to that

1347
02:18:11,640 --> 02:18:17,400
because whether it's here or anywhere else in the world if we don't have the rule of law then we're

1348
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:23,560
in the jungle and on this issue that then has sort of infiltrated many other sectors of our society

1349
02:18:24,360 --> 02:18:29,800
we don't have freedom and the rule of law i always tell people they brag about us having a free

1350
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:35,880
market economy i go really when the most important breakthroughs the last 100 years in science and

1351
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:41,880
technology that would completely turn this planet into a paradise of with free energy

1352
02:18:42,360 --> 02:18:47,080
and all kinds of technologies have been ruthlessly suppressed up to and including

1353
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:52,520
killing people right no we don't have a free market we have a managed economy

1354
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:59,640
right um but so what what the public needs to understand is we need to evolve out of that

1355
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:07,000
100 years of nonsense and to this whole transformative new golden age i mean the

1356
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:11,880
new president's calling that well you're not going to do just a golden age based purely on

1357
02:19:11,880 --> 02:19:18,200
drilling more oil out of the ground you've got to create a golden age by letting our society advance

1358
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:26,680
both uh technologically but also uh in our understanding of consciousness and spirituality

1359
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:32,600
and that we're not alone in the universe and do it in a way that doesn't cause everyone to go

1360
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:36,600
running for the door and jumping off bridges because we're being invaded by aliens i would

1361
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:42,760
love to see trump do one of your ce5 uh oh that'd be great yeah maybe well i want to see you

1362
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:48,760
meditate and kind of communicate with these yeah with these beings i think look you know i i'm

1363
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:53,080
completely non-partisan because i have to be i've worked through many administrations and members

1364
02:19:53,080 --> 02:20:00,600
of congress luckily on this issue in the congress it's very non-partisan currently the people who

1365
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:05,640
are interested which is interesting yeah and it should be that way because it's not just the

1366
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:10,760
united states i'm dealing with countries all over the world and leaders all over the world on this

1367
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:16,760
frankly i won't say which ones but it needs to be a global understanding that transcends

1368
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:23,480
the usual idiotic fracture lines of murderous monkeys fighting over every little division we

1369
02:20:23,480 --> 02:20:29,560
can find right i think we have to go beyond that in our in our thinking and on something like this

1370
02:20:29,640 --> 02:20:36,120
it can't just be a partisan or even just an american issue it really needs to be a global

1371
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:41,800
issue and that that's never happened there have been attempts you know the original disclosure

1372
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:49,400
project of that was supposed to happen at the u.n general assembly in 2001 and the u.n secretary

1373
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:55,080
general was threatened kofi Annan he was absolutely three says if you do this there'll be no more

1374
02:20:55,080 --> 02:21:00,600
funding for the united nations so we had to do at the national press club and his right hand guy

1375
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:07,720
called me up says dr greer we cannot do it here at the u.n so whoa that was 24 years ago in may

1376
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:15,240
so um we got off track again we were talking about ce5 and i wanted to i was asking you

1377
02:21:16,040 --> 02:21:24,840
when you're inviting these extraterrestrials into the space in in your meditation and you're

1378
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:32,520
interfacing with them what is the what is the communication go it runs the gamut um almost

1379
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:39,320
almost any weird thing you can imagine has happened um we've had fully materialized craft appear

1380
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:47,480
and disappear we've had like that one et that appeared between two people uh and then vanish

1381
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:55,640
we've had unusual electromagnetic signals come through our electronic sensor systems

1382
02:21:56,200 --> 02:22:01,560
so like we'll have uh magnetometers and other equipment out there and they will override the

1383
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:08,200
circuitry and start communicating through them very strange and some of its very repeatable

1384
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:14,680
sequences that we've recorded almost like um ericebo without the billion dollar telescopes

1385
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:21,480
you know it's just a repeatable how like like a sequence a pattern that that repeats repeats

1386
02:22:21,480 --> 02:22:28,280
that you know would not naturally occur or would not happen from a man-made source um and and of

1387
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:34,360
course many people have it will be deep in meditation and get a an override vision of a

1388
02:22:34,360 --> 02:22:40,040
craft or a person and say oh there's i'm sensing something in the northwest sky at 60 degrees

1389
02:22:40,600 --> 02:22:44,920
five minutes later craft appears there and moves and comes over so there's a lot of

1390
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:51,320
precognitive capabilities that develop when you develop the consciousness any like direct

1391
02:22:51,320 --> 02:22:58,440
telepathic communication yes all the time yeah and what is the context of it it runs to gamut but

1392
02:22:58,440 --> 02:23:06,520
it's it's oh for many people who i know this is my experience is that they're making it quite clear

1393
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:12,920
they're here for very good reason uh but there a lot of it is also laden with some warning

1394
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:18,520
of where we are and that our civilization is at a point where it needs to either

1395
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:25,800
you know change directions or it's going to face some really terrible outcomes and it's not a

1396
02:23:25,800 --> 02:23:31,560
threat it's it's just like this is where you are and it's sort of like the hopi prophecy where

1397
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:36,040
you know one line terminates and the other one goes on forever if you know the hopi prophecy

1398
02:23:37,240 --> 02:23:43,400
right it's sort of like that that that is a theme that comes up a lot and i think we are at that

1399
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:48,680
point where we're going to have to transition if we continue to think in the same paradigm of

1400
02:23:48,680 --> 02:23:53,880
division and war and conflict you know it sounds like we're using machine guns and tanks you know

1401
02:23:53,880 --> 02:23:59,960
we have not only thermonuclear but these other technologies that are covert it's not sustainable

1402
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:06,280
to live like this uh and nor is it sustainable for the earth's biosphere to have eight billion

1403
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:13,480
people living like we did in the 1800s burning stuff right so these there's a very frequently

1404
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:21,480
a sort of earth-based environmental message that comes through about the dangers not only

1405
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:26,280
geopolitically of endless war with these technologies but also what we're doing to the

1406
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:32,680
oceans and the atmosphere and genetic mutations and cancer rates yeah then all of this is a

1407
02:24:32,680 --> 02:24:38,920
consequence of having suppressed for 100 years breakthroughs in technology that would have moved

1408
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:43,000
us onto another path right so that's what we call the documentary the lost century

1409
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:49,880
because there's a lost century of social and technological evolution but also with that

1410
02:24:50,680 --> 02:24:57,320
uh sort of spiritual evolution because what happens when a world no longer is in want and

1411
02:24:57,320 --> 02:25:03,400
fighting over scarce resources i think the work week will drop to 10 or 15 hours a week

1412
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:08,600
people have extraordinary amount of time for creative pursuits and the pursuit of higher

1413
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:12,680
states of consciousness and meditative and what have you hopefully not everyone's spending all

1414
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:18,120
their time on youtube looking at kitty cats playing the piano but that might happen too but

1415
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:22,520
i think there's two main drivers there's fear of death and i think there's um

1416
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:29,480
sex i think those are the two main drivers of of our civilization the way we're going

1417
02:25:29,480 --> 02:25:34,600
right now there's this there's that there's a famous a great quote uh from this show west

1418
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:40,680
world where he's saying um the human intellect is like peacock feathers the human psyche is

1419
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:46,520
like peacock feathers it's an elaborate mating call everything from the mona lisa to the eiffel

1420
02:25:46,520 --> 02:25:52,920
tower to the brooklyn bridge the statue of david all it is is is an elaborate mating call some of

1421
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:58,520
the best creations and pieces of artwork in human history and that's sort of what drives our

1422
02:25:58,520 --> 02:26:05,080
innovation and our our our part of our drive to make more money to get better things to drive

1423
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:11,960
a nicer car to have a bigger house um and it seems like if we didn't have that if we were

1424
02:26:11,960 --> 02:26:18,920
genderless and we didn't have if we didn't fuck each other to reproduce then maybe that wouldn't

1425
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:23,720
be maybe we would be on a different trajectory well i don't think it's either or either i mean

1426
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:31,320
i think you can have a body and a planet that's physical and also pursue higher states of consciousness

1427
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:37,480
and and spirituality i don't think the setazism is the way i don't i don't think you deny the one

1428
02:26:37,480 --> 02:26:43,160
but you add to that a higher conscious understanding and spirituality and there's an

1429
02:26:43,160 --> 02:26:49,640
i think that is the balance there's sort of like these inherent tensions and contradictions that

1430
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:56,360
that exists in the modern era and has for many many times but one of the features you mentioned

1431
02:26:56,360 --> 02:27:03,080
earlier of the p3 or psionic operators it when you mentioned that some of these areas that we

1432
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:08,040
would call primitive but they're living more in touch with nature have this innate ability it

1433
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:14,040
harkens back to the aboriginals in australia that had what was called dream time and they would

1434
02:27:14,040 --> 02:27:21,240
literally have lucid dreams at night communicate with each other and have meetups with no telephones

1435
02:27:21,240 --> 02:27:26,840
or smoke signals or anything and so in many civilizations that we would dismiss as primitive

1436
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:33,640
that was just net part of the natural order western civilization coming into

1437
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:41,400
science and and through the scientific revolution and also rejecting the superstitions and excesses

1438
02:27:41,400 --> 02:27:46,840
of the middle ages and whatnot sort of threw the baby out with the bath water so i see a time where

1439
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:51,960
we'll go forward as a high tech civilization but at the same time an increasingly conscious and

1440
02:27:52,040 --> 02:27:59,720
enlightened civilization both and i think that's the sort of balance where you become a very

1441
02:27:59,720 --> 02:28:07,080
advanced civilization because primacy is with your conscious evolution you know the world is as you

1442
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:13,320
are as it says in the vedas the world we see as a reflection of what our level of consciousness

1443
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:18,760
and thoughts are and so i think that can evolve there's no reason why we have to be stuck in the

1444
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:25,960
current state of things now change is difficult most people don't like change or adventures i

1445
02:28:25,960 --> 02:28:33,800
love adventures and change but it's something that if we stay you know there's like the old chinese

1446
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:40,120
saying unless we change directions we're likely to end up where we're going and i say look where are

1447
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:46,040
we going you're going to hell in a hand basket right now not just geopolitically but in terms

1448
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:52,200
of tensions and wars but also with the earth and the environment and and poverty do you know there

1449
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:58,680
the economists last couple years ago had an article three billion people on earth don't even have

1450
02:28:58,680 --> 02:29:04,600
energy to cook their food so they're cutting out the brush and making deserts appear and cutting

1451
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:10,840
down the rainforest three billion of the eight billion so there's no way to have a peaceful world

1452
02:29:10,840 --> 02:29:16,680
or a just world with the zero-sum game of the current energy system this becomes very clear

1453
02:29:18,120 --> 02:29:23,640
but as patrick david told me the other day if you bring these out there are so many powerful

1454
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:29,480
interests you're talking about hundreds of trillions of dollars in aggregate impact so

1455
02:29:30,040 --> 02:29:36,520
and that was the mistake of a hundred years ago if these technologies had been brought out when

1456
02:29:36,520 --> 02:29:40,760
there were only two and a half billion people on the earth and very few of those people had

1457
02:29:40,760 --> 02:29:48,280
electricity and cars it would have been a natural evolution now we're either headed towards a very

1458
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:53,720
bad situation globally geopolitically and environmentally geophysically or we have to

1459
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:59,000
bring these out which will be admittedly very disruptive you know talk about a disruptive

1460
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:04,600
technology so how do we do that what's going to have to be very smart and very managed

1461
02:30:05,560 --> 02:30:10,200
and so these are the complexities that to be honest with you world leaders and the president

1462
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:16,920
and the national security council need to be discussing urgently and what i'm concerned

1463
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:24,120
about is that it seems that in the next year or two this is all going to get disclosed and

1464
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:30,680
when i meet with senior government officials which i do quite often they don't know anything

1465
02:30:30,680 --> 02:30:35,480
about the subject or what they do know has been some blended false information

1466
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:41,720
that has led them gas lit them in the wrong path and this frightens me i mean because

1467
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:47,960
knowledge is power and if you don't have it you're going to be manipulated into all the wrong

1468
02:30:47,960 --> 02:30:55,320
decisions and i think we need to have our leaders here and abroad brought up the speed on this in a

1469
02:30:55,320 --> 02:31:03,160
serious way which is i mean what i should be doing and i'm trying to do what i really ought

1470
02:31:03,160 --> 02:31:10,760
to do is retire but i'm tired and i'm getting old but go relax on those 600 acres oh we do

1471
02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:16,040
i take time for that i work out a lot and you know i was almost killed in an accident

1472
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:21,880
about 15 months ago and oh shit oh yeah what happened i don't talk about it it was a mess

1473
02:31:22,440 --> 02:31:27,320
someone saw through the seat on my bicycle mountain bike and it snapped what and my left

1474
02:31:27,320 --> 02:31:31,720
leg came up my left foot came off the bones were in the air this shoulder was ripped off

1475
02:31:31,720 --> 02:31:37,960
my abdomen split open i had four surges oh yeah i even believe the things i've had happen to me

1476
02:31:37,960 --> 02:31:44,120
holy shit it was bad it was the worst i've had um and you know in the 90s had three people my team

1477
02:31:44,200 --> 02:31:52,200
killed a two by electronically induced cancers and the former ci director bill colby who was

1478
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:57,320
going to help us bring these energy technologies out they just wet worked him in the river south

1479
02:31:57,320 --> 02:32:02,680
of dc made it look like an accident so you know this is serious stuff

1480
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:10,440
they literally tried to stay tried to kill you on your bike oh i think it was more of a speed bump

1481
02:32:10,440 --> 02:32:15,240
slow me down it was three weeks after i got back from the black site and the chopper

1482
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:21,240
where i filmed the underground opening yeah uh where some of the lockheed objects come up from

1483
02:32:21,240 --> 02:32:25,320
an underground facility and are tested and i handed that over to the senate intelligence you gotta

1484
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:31,560
be so paranoid man no i'm not not at all no no if you've all these people that you've worked with

1485
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:38,440
have been whacked no no no your paranoid implies that you'd be afraid of all this

1486
02:32:39,240 --> 02:32:45,880
but i think the saving grace even though i was raised an agnostic atheist of having had that

1487
02:32:45,880 --> 02:32:51,800
near-death experience when i was 17 not afraid of death i'm not afraid of that because now i don't

1488
02:32:51,800 --> 02:32:56,520
like being tortured i don't want to be injured i don't want to have a life of misery which is

1489
02:32:57,080 --> 02:33:03,240
what they've made my life a miserable thing um but you know no i mean being uh without this

1490
02:33:03,560 --> 02:33:11,800
uh you know physical body and being in the worlds of the conscious light that i've experienced no

1491
02:33:11,800 --> 02:33:16,360
that's a beautiful thing i don't have a death wish but i'm also not afraid i mean it's sort of

1492
02:33:16,360 --> 02:33:22,440
like the old shambhala warriors of old you know they were spirit warriors why haven't they i mean

1493
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:26,120
i would imagine like all this stuff that you're doing and you've been doing this for so freaking

1494
02:33:26,120 --> 02:33:31,800
long yeah i can't believe they haven't tried to take you out yet well i mean other than the

1495
02:33:31,800 --> 02:33:38,200
bicycle incident oh i've had other i had metastatic malignant melanoma at the same month that a member

1496
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:45,240
of congress in my right hand assistant got cancers i almost died that was in 96 seven something like

1497
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:55,960
that but um yeah i think colby was killed 95 96 bill colby the ci director but how was he killed

1498
02:33:56,600 --> 02:34:02,600
well he allegedly was out canoeing on yeah i've read the story but his his son thought he

1499
02:34:02,600 --> 02:34:09,480
committed suicide but he was working with a colonel and with a member of my team to hand over

1500
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:17,160
one of these zero point quantum generators with about uh 50 million dollars in seed money so we

1501
02:34:17,160 --> 02:34:23,000
could get it out open source it and get it out to the public and um the week he was going to meet

1502
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:28,760
with a member of my board they found him floating down the potomac but it's an unsolved

1503
02:34:28,760 --> 02:34:34,520
murder but we know what happened his best friend came to my friend's funeral sherry's funeral and

1504
02:34:34,520 --> 02:34:43,720
said we both have had terrible losses but can't look back um going back to the angels and demons

1505
02:34:43,720 --> 02:34:49,960
stuff have you heard of the virginia brazil uh incident yes i have that thing smelled like

1506
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:55,640
sulfur and in the bible it talks about demons smelling like sulfur well here's the other

1507
02:34:55,640 --> 02:35:04,200
problem i don't i'm not an expert on that case the question is was it et was it human induced

1508
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:13,800
was it or was it from another dimension um and have you ever seen anything like that you you

1509
02:35:13,800 --> 02:35:18,280
know all about the alien species right you you know all about the catalogue the guy said there's

1510
02:35:18,280 --> 02:35:23,560
69 different oh yeah there's and our our team has had experiences with a huge variety and you've

1511
02:35:23,560 --> 02:35:29,000
never seen anything like that one with the red eyes the virginia one no no and one of the questions

1512
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:40,520
i always have is given what i know about what human electromagnetic field experimentation is done

1513
02:35:40,520 --> 02:35:46,920
there's a physicist i'm working with uh he's down near the redstone arsenal huntsville yeah space

1514
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:52,440
flight center marshal space flight center he has his own skiff i've been in um and his lower level

1515
02:35:52,440 --> 02:35:58,600
his house is also a skiff a secure compartment information facility and uh i mean these guys

1516
02:35:58,600 --> 02:36:06,040
have created like toroidal electromagnetic systems where they will tap into the ninth ring of hell or

1517
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:12,840
whatever and some creature will be 3d running around the lab what and it sounds absolutely

1518
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:20,680
batshit crazy and it is but it's true so what i whatever you can imagine you know ben rich

1519
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:27,560
the week he died was talking to a friend of mine jim goodall who's a well-known aerospace historian

1520
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:34,520
and said and he and jim was pushing on this issue about while lockheed skunk works had he says he

1521
02:36:34,520 --> 02:36:41,640
said well anything you can imagine that you've seen on star trek we've already done at the lockheed

1522
02:36:41,640 --> 02:36:47,480
skunk works and it's not at area 51 it's out in the desert underground and that is true and i've

1523
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:55,480
been over that facility i mean not longer right before i was critically injured but um so there

1524
02:36:55,480 --> 02:37:02,600
are people who have surfaced describing some of those what does that mean uh it means that

1525
02:37:02,600 --> 02:37:09,240
the capabilities of these covert human group could stage anything and this is why people say

1526
02:37:09,240 --> 02:37:14,040
we are the biggest skeptic i ever heard you don't believe that i said well you know i'm not saying

1527
02:37:14,040 --> 02:37:21,800
there aren't genuine uh extraterrestrial non-human intelligence but there's all this other stuff

1528
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:28,920
and all this other stuff gets really complicated and it makes sense once you unpack 70 or 80 years

1529
02:37:28,920 --> 02:37:37,160
of super advanced uh engineering and science and technology from studying this area of physics

1530
02:37:37,800 --> 02:37:44,840
um and one of the big mistakes everyone makes is they don't give enough credit to the genius

1531
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:50,440
of the people who worked on those programs like this gentleman i just referred to he's in he's

1532
02:37:50,440 --> 02:37:55,400
redacted in in the what we're making available to the public but he's not redacted for some other

1533
02:37:55,400 --> 02:38:02,200
folks highest iq one of the highest iqs of anyone i've ever met on earth and what i have found is

1534
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:07,560
that people have very high capabilities they're tapped either right out of college or in high

1535
02:38:07,560 --> 02:38:13,560
school even and brought in because they have such amazing aptitude and there is a process for

1536
02:38:13,560 --> 02:38:21,240
screening for that and it's a real process and uh and they're looking for people with

1537
02:38:21,240 --> 02:38:26,840
extraordinary talents and iqs and abilities so i always tell people the smartest people i've

1538
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:34,520
ever met are not at harvard mit caltech or whatever they're in covert uh operations and

1539
02:38:34,520 --> 02:38:40,600
corporate and some government and those guys are are amazingly brilliant and they're highly

1540
02:38:40,600 --> 02:38:46,600
incentivized to study this and figure out different applications and i think people

1541
02:38:47,240 --> 02:38:52,040
grossly underestimate that and because they underestimate it they're constantly being

1542
02:38:52,040 --> 02:39:00,280
deceived and tricked by human phenomenon human events and and weird stuff and thinking it's

1543
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:05,720
something that isn't uh and that's what happened with the skinwalker ranch there was an innate

1544
02:39:05,720 --> 02:39:10,840
phenomenon there i don't think it was extraterrestrial i think it was extra-dimensional

1545
02:39:11,480 --> 02:39:19,800
and a bunch of guys operating with robert bigelow and and the intelligence community

1546
02:39:20,520 --> 02:39:26,600
set up some electronics that ran the rancher off so they forcibly bought it virtually and then they

1547
02:39:26,600 --> 02:39:31,800
set up all these weird electromagnetic phenomenon there and i know how they did it and i have

1548
02:39:31,800 --> 02:39:37,320
someone who was embedded in that team has described it same thing with the bradshaw ranch near sedona

1549
02:39:37,960 --> 02:39:41,880
you know recently there was someone who works with elizandro on a podcast talking about yeah

1550
02:39:41,880 --> 02:39:47,000
that's an alien but i've had my people scouted out there guys all dressed in black down below a hill

1551
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:53,240
and it's a complete black site i don't know if it's cia or corporate but you know so this happens

1552
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:59,720
all the time if you have an area that has an innate someone say a portal but an innate phenomenon

1553
02:39:59,720 --> 02:40:07,480
going on those will get taken over and turned into a black site that's human and then the public gets

1554
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:15,000
gaslit and deceived about all the phenomenon there so uh so they'll it's a trick it's more trickery

1555
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:19,240
you're saying that they will deliberately use their tricks to make it seem like there's some

1556
02:40:19,240 --> 02:40:23,240
crazy fuckery going on there and it's some sort of interdimensional portals with witches and all

1557
02:40:23,240 --> 02:40:29,160
this stuff and then that will force the ranchers to get rid of to flee and they can buy it terrifying

1558
02:40:29,160 --> 02:40:33,720
and they can keep doing that stuff they ran off the people in the bradshaw ranch same thing with

1559
02:40:33,720 --> 02:40:38,760
skimwalker now there's a new owner i don't know him but i knew the people who got it after the

1560
02:40:38,760 --> 02:40:44,680
rancher was terrified and run off and they can do things through normal electric wires you know

1561
02:40:44,680 --> 02:40:50,440
power lines that they can put a signal down and all of a sudden some creepy thing happens and

1562
02:40:50,440 --> 02:41:00,200
apparition appear and disappear so you know this is the high end of uh what we call the stagecraft

1563
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:09,240
or tradecraft stagecraft yeah staging things and one of the problems with ufology and with

1564
02:41:09,240 --> 02:41:17,720
this whole subject is that you really can't begin to uh even make a judgment call on what

1565
02:41:17,720 --> 02:41:23,240
you're looking at right unless you unpack what the human capabilities are and then you can begin to

1566
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:28,040
put it into the categories and and get some discernment and but it's a very difficult

1567
02:41:28,040 --> 02:41:37,000
thing to do and you know in 1991 i was at a conference and a cia guy old guy he looked

1568
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:43,240
like the cigarette man in the what's that show x-files because they've got some of those episodes

1569
02:41:43,240 --> 02:41:49,640
they took from my early work and we were walking along and he said let's walk along the beach

1570
02:41:50,360 --> 02:41:57,480
and he said look the truth is so much stranger than any fiction we can sell the fiction and

1571
02:41:57,480 --> 02:42:02,840
people will believe it but if you tell people the truth they won't believe it and it's less

1572
02:42:02,840 --> 02:42:10,920
believable than the fiction and it is so that's been a real conundrum fiction has to make sense

1573
02:42:10,920 --> 02:42:17,080
truth doesn't yeah exactly and the truth on this is such a tangled web and it's been done

1574
02:42:17,080 --> 02:42:23,720
deliberately because it has the ability to then confuse the picture but also create the specter

1575
02:42:23,720 --> 02:42:31,560
of fear where the long-term goals can be fulfilled my concern is that disclosure i wrote a paper in

1576
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:38,840
1999 called this on our website when disclosure serves secrecy meaning the secret government

1577
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:47,160
operations and if this issue gets disclosed the way it currently is on track to be it'll be a war

1578
02:42:47,160 --> 02:42:53,240
of the world's panic in the aisle it'll be a thousand times worse than covet the way it's

1579
02:42:53,240 --> 02:43:00,680
on track to be disclosed yes where you have the people who have or keep going up to congress and

1580
02:43:00,680 --> 02:43:08,920
the white house and other places and conflating man-made frightening things like abductions and

1581
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:15,480
villages being blown up with extraterrestrial threat or nhi threat and they're deliberately

1582
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:22,760
co-mingling no one is making this discernment between a bunch of psyops and covert technologies

1583
02:43:22,760 --> 02:43:29,400
masquerading as et there's no one is doing that in fact the dominant paradigm

1584
02:43:30,040 --> 02:43:37,320
is to call all of it one thing and in that calling it one thing it makes people conclude

1585
02:43:37,320 --> 02:43:43,880
there is a threat and we need to fight it so let's go to defcon one let's go to independence day the

1586
02:43:43,880 --> 02:43:51,000
movie let's go to war of the world so i think this manipulation is 99 percent of what people hear

1587
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:57,080
and i don't really honestly right now if you were to put me under a sodium pen a truth serum

1588
02:43:57,960 --> 02:44:05,000
i don't so do you oh good go for it steve lock the doors all right i really don't see

1589
02:44:05,560 --> 02:44:13,240
that right now as things stand as of this moment that there is a critical mass of people

1590
02:44:13,480 --> 02:44:20,440
who are able to come forward and not be captured let's call it by that narrative

1591
02:44:21,320 --> 02:44:26,360
you know trapped by that narrative now it's even gets more spooky when you start dealing with senior

1592
02:44:26,360 --> 02:44:33,480
people in government who have not been read into this who who are brand new to this and we'll go

1593
02:44:33,480 --> 02:44:39,480
in with information and then right after us will be a disinformation team that goes in yeah like

1594
02:44:40,120 --> 02:44:46,200
like clockwork so and i'm a private civilian and those people going with credentials from

1595
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:52,840
the pentagon right or some intelligence agency so you know it's a it's daunting but

1596
02:44:53,560 --> 02:44:58,280
i'm not no i don't think we should give up on getting the truth out and exposing the lies and

1597
02:44:58,280 --> 02:45:04,280
the cover-up but also the trickery but i don't see right now there's a lot of

1598
02:45:05,240 --> 02:45:11,960
bandwidth let's just say so um you were alluding to earlier when you were mentioning elizondo he

1599
02:45:11,960 --> 02:45:18,600
is behind this whole threat narrative it's mixed i mean he's actually evolving a little bit off

1600
02:45:18,600 --> 02:45:26,280
of that because he needs to and and that's been exposed but i think one of the the reason you

1601
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:34,360
initially emerged was to be sure that two or three major false narratives came out one was

1602
02:45:35,320 --> 02:45:41,000
we don't have anything that's man-made that could be this when 80% of what people are saying are

1603
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:45,960
man-made covert okay okay that was one message the other was that it's a threat to the national

1604
02:45:45,960 --> 02:45:55,000
security which it is but not from out there in space it's the threat is within i mean right but

1605
02:45:55,000 --> 02:46:01,000
he was the rogue secret government organization is the threat it's treasonous it's traitorous

1606
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:10,280
it's murderous it's unconstitutional it's criminal so that narrative uh it is to say

1607
02:46:10,280 --> 02:46:15,720
what i just described when disclosure serves secrecy yes this is real it's all coming out the

1608
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:23,160
ufos are real which everybody's known forever um but they're a threat and we don't have anything

1609
02:46:23,160 --> 02:46:29,000
that can fly like that now luckily in the last two or three years does elizando say that that

1610
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:33,080
we don't have anything like this yes he did initially not anymore not anymore and neither

1611
02:46:33,080 --> 02:46:39,000
neither is grush and neither is fravor and others but that was something that i was forcefully

1612
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:44,360
in the public saying that is a falsehood and i would go to senators and congressmen say

1613
02:46:44,360 --> 02:46:50,040
no that is wrong and that is a lie and a damnable lie because if you believe that

1614
02:46:50,680 --> 02:46:56,440
then a priori you have to think that all the horrible things that have happened have also

1615
02:46:56,440 --> 02:47:02,120
been at the hands of the ets when they've been at the hands of a cia special operations team

1616
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:08,440
right or so special operators right so i think that that was the thing that concerned me the most

1617
02:47:08,440 --> 02:47:15,400
now i'm hoping you know i mean i look i don't have any grievance against any individual honestly

1618
02:47:16,120 --> 02:47:22,200
i mean mostly i don't know them i'm more concerned about the human future and human

1619
02:47:22,200 --> 02:47:29,000
consciousness being polluted with a false narrative that leads us into this dystopian future of

1620
02:47:29,640 --> 02:47:35,000
endless war and expanded war into space and all this stuff because that's how you get the

1621
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:41,320
armageddon that's how you get to a catastrophic conclusion so that's my big concern and i think

1622
02:47:41,320 --> 02:47:47,000
this is why i don't care who you are um i'm going to speak the truth about it there's an

1623
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:53,800
old saying i speak the truth whether it gives you counsel or offense um so that's the er doc in me

1624
02:47:53,800 --> 02:47:59,160
you know if you've got a brain tumor i'm not going to tell you have a migraine right so that's just

1625
02:47:59,160 --> 02:48:05,720
me but you know and it makes me very controversial and very unlikable which i don't care i'm not

1626
02:48:05,720 --> 02:48:12,520
running for mayor of crazy town ufology either so i couldn't care about that sure i care about

1627
02:48:12,520 --> 02:48:19,000
what the truth is but also how the truth is articulated that doesn't result in some just

1628
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:24,680
furtherance of the agenda of the secret group because what would be i mean this is their dream

1629
02:48:25,400 --> 02:48:31,960
is to let this come out and pivot the whole world onto a path of needing big brother to run endless

1630
02:48:31,960 --> 02:48:41,160
war in offensive and defensive operations against nhi right that that's been the plan and and i you

1631
02:48:41,160 --> 02:48:48,760
know right now i will say that the weight of the thrust of how this is being brought forward if

1632
02:48:48,760 --> 02:48:55,320
you'll get media reports social media that is the thrust of what's happening we're trying to bend the

1633
02:48:55,320 --> 02:49:02,200
curve towards something truthful but also a positive outcome for humanity and for the

1634
02:49:02,200 --> 02:49:07,880
united states because the united states is to crown jewel in these covert secret programs and

1635
02:49:09,240 --> 02:49:15,480
many of our big corporations are tied into these in a compartmented special projects divisions and

1636
02:49:16,280 --> 02:49:22,440
a lot of them so i think we we have to figure out how to do this but you know this needs to come out

1637
02:49:22,440 --> 02:49:27,720
where it's and i basically in here there's a you're gonna laugh it's a draft speech for the

1638
02:49:27,720 --> 02:49:32,920
president or other world leaders to give that i've written why would i laugh about that no

1639
02:49:32,920 --> 02:49:40,600
because people go really it's kind of i said but it has to be this coming out you cannot speak about

1640
02:49:40,600 --> 02:49:46,520
this with well let's just blow them out of the sky you know right that kind of thing so you know

1641
02:49:46,520 --> 02:49:51,960
this is dangerous the kind of talk that attends the disclosure discussions

1642
02:49:53,800 --> 02:50:00,680
leads to a catastrophic outcome for the earth and humanity and there's one other risk it's a

1643
02:50:00,680 --> 02:50:09,080
little bit more ominous and that is there are three different people i'm working with they don't know

1644
02:50:09,080 --> 02:50:13,480
each other that have been in comm centers communication centers where somehow they have

1645
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:24,760
intercepted communications from nhi direction terrestrials yeah that they're getting quite

1646
02:50:24,760 --> 02:50:32,040
fed up with the fact that we're taking their technologies and using it against them and that

1647
02:50:32,040 --> 02:50:38,840
that has reached the point where we are a threat not just to ourselves but out there so people

1648
02:50:38,840 --> 02:50:47,800
are grossly underestimating how those covert programs are threatening earth because not that

1649
02:50:47,800 --> 02:50:54,680
these civilizations are hostile but they certainly are not going to let a rogue group of psychopaths

1650
02:50:54,680 --> 02:51:00,520
threaten other worlds so if we don't get this under control it'll have to be brought under control

1651
02:51:00,520 --> 02:51:04,840
but the worst case scenario is why don't the aliens just fix this i said that would be the

1652
02:51:04,840 --> 02:51:12,120
worst case scenario because if that happens it'll be portrayed as an alien invasion wouldn't those

1653
02:51:12,120 --> 02:51:16,360
wouldn't the aliens just too smart for that yeah the aliens are smart they're way smarter than us

1654
02:51:16,360 --> 02:51:22,200
they have to be iq's 400 north of 400 so why wouldn't they just quietly go after those people

1655
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:26,280
and just shut them down there would be no way to do that without it also being portrayed by their

1656
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:32,760
lackeys in government in the media as an alien invasion so i'm saying quietly do it so no one

1657
02:51:32,760 --> 02:51:38,280
no way to quietly do this my friend i mean do you if you start looking at the map in here

1658
02:51:39,400 --> 02:51:45,720
and the list of corporations sites facilities the trillions of dollars involved with this

1659
02:51:46,840 --> 02:51:52,600
that ain't gonna happen where it wouldn't be noticed now humans can get our here's what i

1660
02:51:52,600 --> 02:51:59,720
think is the one of the messages is that we need to fix our own mess here and there's no reason we

1661
02:51:59,720 --> 02:52:07,240
can't i think it's sort of a weird cosmic codependency to think that someone from out

1662
02:52:07,240 --> 02:52:11,400
there and he's going to land here and fix our problems i mean how well did that work in

1663
02:52:11,400 --> 02:52:16,840
afghanistan right oh we're going to go in and nation build and they're right back to warlords

1664
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:23,160
and nonsense it's got to come from the people right now i don't necessarily say the leaders the

1665
02:52:23,160 --> 02:52:27,960
people they know that the people will lead the leaders will have to follow but we become very

1666
02:52:27,960 --> 02:52:35,000
passive people and i think we have to not be so passive i think the people need to

1667
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:41,720
speak up stand up articulate and hopefully exhort our leaders to do the right thing

1668
02:52:43,720 --> 02:52:49,320
you know i grew up in the i was born 1955 so i remember i grew up in the south report

1669
02:52:50,040 --> 02:52:57,960
and you know my my my grandmother's Cherokee my father was half native and they were called half

1670
02:52:57,960 --> 02:53:06,520
breeds and uh i have a twin sister looks very native and but you know the at that time there

1671
02:53:06,520 --> 02:53:14,040
was jim crow in the south there was still segregated water fountains all that and uh and i

1672
02:53:14,520 --> 02:53:19,720
remember how weird that was i mean i was four five six and i'd go to a water fountain where

1673
02:53:19,720 --> 02:53:23,720
there was no line and a little old lady would grab me and say don't drink out of that one

1674
02:53:24,280 --> 02:53:28,920
that's for i think they said colored people or something like that yeah and i went because i

1675
02:53:28,920 --> 02:53:34,680
was in it my parents were not all racist i went well is the water different is it it was like

1676
02:53:34,680 --> 02:53:42,600
this magical system this racist system and i saw that evolve and i had an african american

1677
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:48,600
girlfriend in high school i almost got run over by a bunch of racists who did not like that and

1678
02:53:49,320 --> 02:53:56,600
you know but that all changed not because the president and congress changed it it happened

1679
02:53:56,600 --> 02:54:02,600
because of baird rustin and martin luther king and there was a movement that made that happen

1680
02:54:02,600 --> 02:54:10,680
right so i think people forget that big changes in society rarely come from the top down it comes

1681
02:54:10,680 --> 02:54:16,520
from the people up sure and this is uh not that lesson is lost in most people today because

1682
02:54:17,240 --> 02:54:23,080
most people just sit around looking at their phones and don't do anything but uh i remember

1683
02:54:23,080 --> 02:54:27,720
that era and i remember how different i mean things aren't perfect now with race relations

1684
02:54:27,720 --> 02:54:33,960
but boy it's a big difference from the 50s and 60s when i was a kid and imagine having an african

1685
02:54:34,040 --> 02:54:41,000
american girlfriend in north carolina in 72 or three you know so i think that you know progress

1686
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:46,920
can happen but it's a lot of hard work and a lot of sacrifice and people have to stand up and be

1687
02:54:46,920 --> 02:54:54,360
heard and uh that's part of what the whole disclosure movement has been about that that i

1688
02:54:54,360 --> 02:54:58,760
when i started people don't realize that we started the whole disclosure movement in the 90s

1689
02:54:59,320 --> 02:55:03,480
it's now the even the word disclosure is used by the new york times but that was

1690
02:55:03,480 --> 02:55:11,560
we started that in in the mid the late 90s yeah right now obviously i think you've said it before

1691
02:55:11,560 --> 02:55:16,920
but you believe that people organizations whether i don't know if it's if you're talking about the

1692
02:55:16,920 --> 02:55:23,160
government or if you're talking about these rogue groups have possession or captive alien bodies

1693
02:55:23,720 --> 02:55:27,800
you know they have living ones as well they have living ones and who and who is this that is this

1694
02:55:27,800 --> 02:55:31,480
is this the government or is this this rogue rogue organization that's the rogue government

1695
02:55:31,480 --> 02:55:36,040
it's the secret government and those are in places that need to be let's call liberated and

1696
02:55:36,760 --> 02:55:43,640
do you know where they are not precisely i have a very good idea so one of the things we have mapped

1697
02:55:43,640 --> 02:55:51,000
are the underground entry points and then we're in the connectivity say you have the edwards

1698
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:56,360
complex and then you have east of there what's called the ant hill and those are entry points

1699
02:55:56,360 --> 02:56:04,440
into underground subterranean facilities or bases but they connect underground to nellis

1700
02:56:04,440 --> 02:56:10,200
and out to the northern net so it's an underground that's what they call it an ant hill if you go to

1701
02:56:10,200 --> 02:56:15,880
an ant there's tunnels you go in and there are all these connections right so we we have a very good

1702
02:56:15,880 --> 02:56:22,360
idea of where those are and some of the whistleblowers we're working with know even more and that needs to

1703
02:56:22,360 --> 02:56:28,280
be provided to people in the u.s government so that they can get control of those and

1704
02:56:28,280 --> 02:56:32,600
there are some very brave men i'm working with who have been special forces guys

1705
02:56:33,240 --> 02:56:40,040
who are prepared to go in and get those facilities under control and also to liberate those people

1706
02:56:40,040 --> 02:56:44,280
that's crazy too if these things are so smart and so advanced how are they going to let

1707
02:56:44,280 --> 02:56:50,360
one of their own be captive by by us well you know that's a lot of people say that but

1708
02:56:50,360 --> 02:56:57,160
just because you're advanced doesn't mean terrible things don't happen i mean you know it technically

1709
02:56:57,160 --> 02:57:02,680
you could throw a bunch of spears by cavemen into the rotors of a sikorsky helicopter and

1710
02:57:02,680 --> 02:57:09,800
jam it up and have it crash so you know bad things happen you know of course being a trauma guy i

1711
02:57:09,800 --> 02:57:14,600
mean i you just see the weirdest things happen so just because they're very advanced people

1712
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:19,720
conflate that with being infallible right well i think god's infallible but certainly no

1713
02:57:19,720 --> 02:57:24,920
individual person or civilization is infallible so this concept it just because they're extremely

1714
02:57:24,920 --> 02:57:30,360
high tech and bright mean they're infallible no uh now is it that often that it happens

1715
02:57:30,920 --> 02:57:37,960
no it doesn't the one site i was over um i was told there are one or two et craft per year downed

1716
02:57:38,920 --> 02:57:45,240
and i went over two black sites and so you know two to four a year over a big area of that part

1717
02:57:45,240 --> 02:57:50,840
of the desert um so it's not like they're dropping out the sky like flies is what i'm saying uh it's

1718
02:57:50,840 --> 02:57:57,240
still terrible uh but then remember we have sites like that all over the world out back up australia

1719
02:57:57,240 --> 02:58:04,920
south america all around and it's still tragic and it shouldn't be happening and when there are

1720
02:58:04,920 --> 02:58:10,440
ones that are living they just don't flat out kill them they would prefer to interrogate them

1721
02:58:10,440 --> 02:58:15,640
and keep them and so they're my understanding is that there are a number of et's that are in

1722
02:58:15,640 --> 02:58:21,960
captivity and are still living one guy euphemistically called them refugees i think not

1723
02:58:21,960 --> 02:58:30,280
they're prisoners but uh you know so i think that is another you know humanitarian effort that should

1724
02:58:30,280 --> 02:58:37,640
happen at some point where they're uh they're freed and how many different versions or species

1725
02:58:37,640 --> 02:58:43,000
of these things do you think we have and have you ever seen any of them in person i'm not seen living

1726
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:50,920
ones in captivity on those bases no i've seen et's and but um they're not to my knowledge i've

1727
02:58:50,920 --> 02:58:55,800
never heard anyone describe the variety of them i know that in the crash retrievals now we have

1728
02:58:55,800 --> 02:59:04,520
122 documented crash retrieval events that are in part of them are in here but in our archive dpi

1729
02:59:04,520 --> 02:59:11,720
archive.com all of them are in there um and they range from ones that are a foot foot and a half

1730
02:59:11,720 --> 02:59:20,920
tall to some that are eight ten feet tall and all kinds of different we just say you know genetic

1731
02:59:20,920 --> 02:59:27,000
expressions but they seem to all have a head two arms and two legs but interesting but beyond that

1732
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:33,880
there's just an infinite variety uh what about the mantis ones well that one that was the healer

1733
02:59:34,680 --> 02:59:41,720
when you see him and they is sort of a triangular head and they're known as really extraordinary

1734
02:59:41,720 --> 02:59:46,520
healers i mean they have some amazing healing capabilities that one right there this guy that's

1735
02:59:46,520 --> 02:59:53,400
a mantis yeah what some people would call a sort of triangular head uh you can see in a sort of uh

1736
02:59:53,400 --> 02:59:59,160
you can outline it if i had my cursor i could do it but um remember this is in complete darkness

1737
02:59:59,160 --> 03:00:05,640
in the wilderness up on a mountain in arizona this was actually in uh oracle ironic o-r-a-c like

1738
03:00:05,640 --> 03:00:12,360
oh really or oracle arizona interesting yeah a couple years ago and um so that's uh you know

1739
03:00:12,360 --> 03:00:19,480
and we love doing that that's my real passion is going out in the experimentation and uh using

1740
03:00:19,480 --> 03:00:24,600
consciousness and remote viewing to make contact and see what happens and a lot of it varies on the

1741
03:00:24,600 --> 03:00:30,360
group because if there's someone not on the page or someone there who's filled with superstition

1742
03:00:30,360 --> 03:00:36,440
and fear they won't show up uh because they don't want to be around dumb people who haven't figured

1743
03:00:37,320 --> 03:00:42,440
now what sorry but um you know if you haven't figured that out they're going why are you out

1744
03:00:42,440 --> 03:00:47,400
there with us you know go home yeah and go look at uh stranger things or something

1745
03:00:49,320 --> 03:00:56,520
what how far have you gotten in your investigation into those beings that you talked about and studied

1746
03:00:56,520 --> 03:01:02,600
in your serious documentary the small beings and i think you talked about gary nolan worked with

1747
03:01:02,600 --> 03:01:08,760
you on that yeah gary nolan received a lot of money right after we gave him that genetic sample

1748
03:01:09,400 --> 03:01:14,360
and he altered the results of it so we don't know what that creature is he he received a lot of money

1749
03:01:14,360 --> 03:01:22,280
yeah i think it was 3.4 million from the pentagon and uh and then so he is now contracting with the

1750
03:01:22,280 --> 03:01:29,400
intelligence community to show uap injuries which is just a psyop it's a yes of course i mean the

1751
03:01:29,400 --> 03:01:34,040
uap injuries are all man-made but of course you get someone like him man-made it's the man-made

1752
03:01:34,040 --> 03:01:40,840
reverse engineered of course and of course but you you put this uh the stink on the ets when

1753
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:47,320
it's something we've done right so uh unfortunately you know i think that went sideways very badly so

1754
03:01:48,040 --> 03:01:52,760
to this day we don't know what that thing was now he published a report saying it was a deformed

1755
03:01:52,760 --> 03:02:01,640
fetus even though the top uh geneticist or a doctor who deals with bone malformations said

1756
03:02:01,640 --> 03:02:08,200
no way because it was global it had growth plates uh consistent equivalent of a six-year-old human

1757
03:02:08,200 --> 03:02:13,560
but it was only about six inches tall and so we don't know what it was it could have been something

1758
03:02:13,560 --> 03:02:18,920
that is a completely unknown species on earth it could have been something that's a result of

1759
03:02:19,480 --> 03:02:26,920
both earth and non-human interactions that are ancient in that part of the Atacama desert and

1760
03:02:26,920 --> 03:02:32,680
Shelly yeah there are accounts of these ufos being seen and these small creatures the adult

1761
03:02:32,680 --> 03:02:38,040
ones are like a foot and a half tall but to this day we actually don't know what it is i mean i

1762
03:02:38,040 --> 03:02:42,840
never said it was et i said we don't know what it is but it's most certainly not human so what was

1763
03:02:42,840 --> 03:02:50,120
published by gary nolan and those guys and i've had the top geneticists in the world tear apart

1764
03:02:50,120 --> 03:02:57,560
their data so it's totally hoaxed it's totally academic fraud really yes but this happened you

1765
03:02:57,560 --> 03:03:02,280
know this and this is why you asked about being paranoid i'm careful but i'm not paranoid because

1766
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:09,640
i've had so many people who could go on the path of finding the truth and they either get blackmailed

1767
03:03:09,640 --> 03:03:16,920
and or both bribed given a lot of money and the next thing you know there everything goes

1768
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:23,320
sideways and so you know i've seen that dozens hundreds of times in 35 years the way you know

1769
03:03:23,320 --> 03:03:30,680
you know it makes you a little bit cynical i guess they are skeptical so but no no he i mean he

1770
03:03:30,680 --> 03:03:38,440
completely started out as an honest person i know that and and when we first met in 2012 i think

1771
03:03:39,640 --> 03:03:45,400
but at this point man that's got to be cleaned up it's a mess what about those mummies that were

1772
03:03:46,760 --> 03:03:53,480
the or in peru the the mummies that were shown to mexican congress by by jamie a heime muson

1773
03:03:53,480 --> 03:04:03,960
those those were actually from peru and from a cave and we know i know the researchers the

1774
03:04:03,960 --> 03:04:11,080
scientists who looked into that i've never been down there but um it was handled like you would

1775
03:04:11,080 --> 03:04:19,080
handle there's a lot of buffoonery that goes on with the ufo subculture it was handled in a poor

1776
03:04:19,080 --> 03:04:29,400
way but i actually think the the actual mummies are legitimate a very old thousands of years old

1777
03:04:29,640 --> 03:04:36,840
uh non-human species now how they got there where they're originally from but these are not

1778
03:04:36,840 --> 03:04:44,280
hoaxes i've seen the cross sections i've seen the cat scans but unfortunately i was going to go down

1779
03:04:44,280 --> 03:04:51,560
there with the team this past spring last year and try to do a scientific expedition but there was

1780
03:04:51,560 --> 03:04:56,920
too much interference from other people and i i pulled out of that but there needs to be a whole

1781
03:04:56,920 --> 03:05:03,240
series you have to do ancient dna right which you mean is different from dna you pull on a live

1782
03:05:03,240 --> 03:05:09,400
person and it's a whole different technique you need to have really good forensic dissections

1783
03:05:09,400 --> 03:05:15,080
partial dissections and you need to have every one of them cat scanned and then the metal objects

1784
03:05:15,080 --> 03:05:21,640
on them have to go through a very sophisticated and expensive analysis to see if the atomic

1785
03:05:22,360 --> 03:05:28,440
uh let's just say whether it was of earth origin metal or from out there and you can do that but

1786
03:05:28,440 --> 03:05:35,480
this is a very um complex and expensive and time-consuming endeavor that would run into

1787
03:05:36,200 --> 03:05:42,440
the hundreds of thousands to a couple million bucks to do right properly now there's never

1788
03:05:42,440 --> 03:05:47,160
that kind of the only funding like that in the ufo subculture is to fund things that are

1789
03:05:47,160 --> 03:05:54,520
disinformation operations um fact so that has not happened yet i maybe it will at some point

1790
03:05:56,840 --> 03:06:03,560
but my assessment of i actually visited a man in utah who had acquired several of these but they

1791
03:06:03,560 --> 03:06:10,680
were still in peru and he gave me a lot of information that i when i saw it and he was

1792
03:06:10,680 --> 03:06:19,640
scientist and i went yeah these are real now their origins i don't know you know and uh no

1793
03:06:19,640 --> 03:06:25,720
one's to my knowledge done a proper dna someone attempted to i think it was a russian archaeologist

1794
03:06:25,720 --> 03:06:30,920
but it was not done properly i don't have faith in it because it's very different when you take

1795
03:06:30,920 --> 03:06:37,800
dna from either someone recently deceased or living sure how you run that is very different

1796
03:06:37,800 --> 03:06:44,280
than what's called ancient dna an ancient could be even 30 years old because it anyway it breaks

1797
03:06:44,280 --> 03:06:50,920
down in a way that to get a correct genetic code read on it is a completely esoteric and you in

1798
03:06:50,920 --> 03:06:57,400
specialized area of genetic sequencing it isn't like regular genetic sequencing so you know i

1799
03:06:57,400 --> 03:07:01,560
would know how to direct that scientific project i haven't had time and then when we were going

1800
03:07:01,560 --> 03:07:07,640
to go down there was all kinds of nonsense and theatrics and trickery and i said i'm out of here

1801
03:07:07,640 --> 03:07:15,000
until this gets cleaned up yeah so what's on the horizon for you as far as like your whistleblowers

1802
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:21,480
and what like what do you think is going to happen and in what time frame as far as getting these

1803
03:07:21,480 --> 03:07:28,120
people like jake in front of congress and getting this stuff actually not going into a skiff and then

1804
03:07:28,120 --> 03:07:33,800
disappearing and actually seeing something happen something tangible take place and and guide this

1805
03:07:33,800 --> 03:07:38,920
whole thing in the right direction well you make a good point the worst one of my concerns is

1806
03:07:39,640 --> 03:07:44,760
this comes out and gets spun as a threat like i was talking about or it simply goes back into

1807
03:07:44,760 --> 03:07:49,560
the black pit of calcutta you know in other words it just gets put back into a black project it

1808
03:07:49,560 --> 03:07:57,160
begins to surface it gets slammed back down again both could happen hopefully it neither do but so

1809
03:07:57,160 --> 03:08:04,360
what i'm continuing to do i'm going from from here back up to well i'm actually given a lecture

1810
03:08:04,360 --> 03:08:11,080
here in st petersburg oh really and then i'm going to be going back to dc for some meetings

1811
03:08:11,080 --> 03:08:20,840
with congress folks and then i'll be back down here to meet with anyway a general oh really who

1812
03:08:20,840 --> 03:08:30,120
is yes and who had been at one point the national security advisor for a president so you know we're

1813
03:08:30,120 --> 03:08:37,480
trying to still work the system and get the the more important trajectory i think is going to be

1814
03:08:38,760 --> 03:08:46,200
empowered people through an executive order to take all these whistleblowers we have

1815
03:08:46,280 --> 03:08:54,920
protect them and then get their information and then get those old legacy corrupt programs

1816
03:08:54,920 --> 03:09:00,840
under control and that's the real plan you know and whether we can make it happen we're going to

1817
03:09:01,480 --> 03:09:08,760
give it the all-out effort this year and and i think it can i actually i think there are people

1818
03:09:08,760 --> 03:09:14,280
in the new administration very open to this i don't think they have much information i mean i've met

1819
03:09:14,280 --> 03:09:24,440
with some of the incoming prospective cabinet members already and but what what's i don't think

1820
03:09:24,440 --> 03:09:29,960
there's yet a consensus on the path to take and unfortunately a lot of them have been targeted

1821
03:09:29,960 --> 03:09:36,200
with false information so it's complicated just like members of congress have had that happen

1822
03:09:37,160 --> 03:09:41,640
the best i can do is give the information the evidence and the advice and

1823
03:09:43,720 --> 03:09:47,960
and then see how they carry the ball in the meanwhile i actually think that they need to

1824
03:09:47,960 --> 03:09:52,280
be hearing from the public you know the public can get this and say oh these recommendations these

1825
03:09:52,280 --> 03:09:57,400
executive orders and what kind do it you know just write a letter you know to your members and a lot

1826
03:09:57,400 --> 03:10:01,160
of people don't do that they may as very old-fashioned but i mentioned this earlier

1827
03:10:01,160 --> 03:10:05,400
i've heard from so many people in washington who are elected representatives and they go

1828
03:10:05,400 --> 03:10:10,360
we really want to hear from our constituents on this but most people they just this is

1829
03:10:10,360 --> 03:10:15,160
entertainment for people right it's just yeah that's the other thing about it that we haven't

1830
03:10:15,160 --> 03:10:19,480
talked about we've been talking about the the psyop within a psyop angle of this whole thing

1831
03:10:19,480 --> 03:10:23,960
the whole time and the counterintelligence disinformation and strategic deception but like

1832
03:10:23,960 --> 03:10:30,200
you have to layer on top of that this whole this whole subject is a business for people too

1833
03:10:30,200 --> 03:10:37,800
yep people that build their careers off talking about this stuff and doing all kinds of crazy

1834
03:10:37,800 --> 03:10:44,520
shit i lost my career over it but yeah i've given up 15 or 20 million dollars i mean careers i mean

1835
03:10:44,520 --> 03:10:50,040
careers based on the topic itself oh of course and the scarier and more false it is the more

1836
03:10:50,040 --> 03:10:55,160
money there is yeah because they're going to open every door to a book publisher or a big movie deal

1837
03:10:55,240 --> 03:11:01,640
if the information is bs right but it's scary so that's the other thing i discovered is that

1838
03:11:02,600 --> 03:11:05,320
you know we'll put something like this out of print on demand

1839
03:11:05,880 --> 03:11:10,760
but harper collins will give someone a million dollar contract to put out a book this full of

1840
03:11:10,760 --> 03:11:15,880
nonsense and sure disinformation designed to scare the hell out of people gee i wonder how

1841
03:11:15,880 --> 03:11:21,960
that happens yeah so i you know this is something i just accept is the way things are right now it

1842
03:11:21,960 --> 03:11:26,680
might change who knows well and we've started our own podcast by the way oh yeah i was gonna say

1843
03:11:26,680 --> 03:11:29,960
i was gonna say tell people uh where they can learn more about what you're doing and

1844
03:11:29,960 --> 03:11:35,640
yeah you know your your uh your website and all that stuff yeah so uh you'll be able to get this

1845
03:11:35,640 --> 03:11:41,880
now on you know our site the briefing document material we have a podcast uh that we've started

1846
03:11:41,880 --> 03:11:47,080
we've only done i think four or five episodes they're not fancy like this they're very homemade

1847
03:11:47,080 --> 03:11:51,880
but that's that's our bandwidth the homemade ones are the best yeah it's quite primitive

1848
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:57,560
but it it's to get the information out and as all this begins to break i want to be able to

1849
03:11:57,560 --> 03:12:04,840
on a weekly basis comment on it um and then uh if you want to sort of be part of the ce5

1853
03:12:24,040 --> 03:12:28,680
and put it up but it'll still be a fun experience you'll really learn a lot because you'll be part
