1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
But here's the thing, Jesse.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,720
I don't really care about the inner person.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,680
Buckle up and brace for impact because our next guest

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,800
is cultural commentator, mathematician,

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,240
and brain masseuse, Eric Weinstein.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,120
Hello, you ready to get some burgers?

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,920
How are you?

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,680
How you doing?

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,880
If the ideas in GU are wrong, then they're just wrong.

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,120
When I first met Eric, it was three years ago,

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,480
and he had just started a movement

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,360
called the Intellectual Dark Web.

13
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,640
The movement is not as ominous as it sounds.

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,680
In fact, it's just a bunch of pro-reason, pro-democracy

15
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,200
centrist intellectuals.

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,840
Other members of the group included Joe Rogan, Jordan

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,160
Peterson, Sam Harris, and last but not least,

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,000
Eric's brother, Brett Weinstein,

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,720
badass evolutionary biologist perennially

20
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,600
on YouTube's Most Wanted list.

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,160
So I thought more people should be aware of Eric and his ideas.

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,880
Thus began a year and a half of me

23
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,160
hounding him to start a podcast in effort

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,680
that eventually became The Portal.

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,720
Hello and welcome.

26
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
You found The Portal.

27
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,320
I brought my producer, Jesse Michaels, here.

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,400
I was a pain in the ass to this guy.

29
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,160
I did not return his phone calls.

30
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,280
I get messages from you that would be like,

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,800
well, it's three days later, and you still don't have a podcast.

32
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,000
The way I describe Eric to people who might not know who he is

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,440
is if Stephen Hawking and Christopher Hitchens

34
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,640
had a baby while listening to A Whole Lot of Love by Led Zeppelin.

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,480
Eric is a complete polymath.

36
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,960
He knows multiple languages.

37
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,400
He plays multiple instruments.

38
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,240
He can go toe to toe with the top physicists in the country.

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,040
His brain is a rare mutation.

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,320
What is an American tradition?

41
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,080
What is it?

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,720
Something a baby boomer did twice.

43
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,240
We discuss Eric's theory of everything in physics,

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,360
the institutional and economic headwinds facing young people

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,000
in this country, artificial general intelligence,

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,680
and even UFOs.

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,800
What was that?

48
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,400
Please enjoy this special long-form interview

49
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,400
with the love of my work life, the bane of my existence,

50
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,400
and this week's American alchemist, Eric Weinstein.

51
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,400
So let's just get right into it.

52
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,640
It's a very strange time that we're living in.

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,360
I was just trying to measure that, actually.

54
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,760
How strange this morning.

55
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,360
Let's give people a little history.

56
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,000
So gain-of-function research is basically

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,160
creating, trying to look around the corner on maybe

58
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,600
what the next pathogen or virus will be,

59
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,480
creating it in an artificial lab setting

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,000
so that you can then come up with the cure.

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,480
Obama actually sunsets it because he

62
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,480
thinks that it's too dangerous.

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,280
Fauci kind of takes advantage of the chaos

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,720
of the Trump administration and restarts

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,200
the gain-of-function funding that the NIH is doing in 2017.

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,760
And we're now giving money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

67
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,520
which is a lab with a poor safety record.

68
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,640
A lot of what this has to do with is bio warfare

69
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,320
being something that we're uncomfortable with,

70
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,200
just the way it's like doing chemistry.

71
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,600
Just the way it's like doing chemical weapons research.

72
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,200
You have to do the research in a defensive capacity.

73
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,400
Everything has a dual role.

74
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,760
My point is that you're listening to Colonel Jessup.

75
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,960
You snotty little bastard.

76
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,680
You may find my existence repugnant,

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,400
but you want me on that wall.

78
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,280
You want me on that post.

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,120
And the fact that you can't stomach what it is.

80
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,200
You may have an idea that it's really important

81
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,320
that we be good, kind stewards of the planet,

82
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,360
but you want your burger, don't you?

83
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,680
And somebody's got to kill that cow and take the organs out

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,040
and serve it up so you can pretend

85
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,520
that that little piece of protein

86
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,680
came from a protein factory, which it didn't.

87
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,400
Well, that's what Anthony Fauci thinks.

88
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,560
It's like, for whatever reason, I'm

89
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,360
the guy that you've put in this position

90
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,960
to handle this really terrible portfolio of things

91
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,320
we're not supposed to be doing, but we have to be doing.

92
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,680
Not gain-of-function.

93
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,920
But if you think about it, we do this with our military.

94
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,000
We tell the military what it can and cannot do,

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,960
and then we find out that it uses contractors,

96
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,040
because they may not be covered under what

97
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,560
you can ask the military to do.

98
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,600
For example, you might put your secrets inside

99
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,600
of an aerospace company, because you don't want to hold them

100
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,720
inside of government, because inside of government,

101
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,440
they're vulnerable.

102
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,840
Boyer requests and scrutiny.

103
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,480
Likewise, tyranny of censorship.

104
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,520
You want that done through private corporations,

105
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,960
because the government is under all sorts of requirements

106
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,440
not to do that.

107
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,880
So when people say things like, well, it's a private company.

108
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,120
It can do whatever it wants.

109
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,840
Well, not really.

110
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,920
You ever tried to produce food and not

111
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,320
say what the ingredient list is?

112
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,880
It's pretty tough to sell food.

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,440
Right.

114
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,400
Right?

115
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:30,880
OK.

116
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,760
Why don't I know what the ingredient list is

117
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,880
in the algorithms that mutate my conversations?

118
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,080
I can't see a thing.

119
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,400
And at some level, we farmed out tyranny to private companies.

120
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,440
Let's talk about what COVID exposed

121
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,800
as far as the dynamic between the US and China for a second.

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,960
So very broadly and crudely speaking,

123
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,080
we've moved away from a manufacturing economy

124
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,920
towards more of a kind of service-based economy.

125
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,520
And we've become dependent on supply chains

126
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,880
abroad for all sorts of essential goods and services.

127
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,560
We've basically outsourced our sort of self-sufficiency.

128
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,400
And so what do we do?

129
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,800
It feels like we've done nothing as far as.

130
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,640
We don't exist.

131
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,360
I think you're thinking too small.

132
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,000
OK.

133
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,160
I don't think, when you say the US and China,

134
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,840
that you're talking about two countries.

135
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,680
You're talking about a country that exists, which is China,

136
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
and a country that has existed in the past that

137
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,240
does not exist now.

138
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,880
And that what happened in World War II

139
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,520
is that we had such a coherence that it took a very long time

140
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,360
for the decay function to eradicate

141
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,480
the ability of that country to do things.

142
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,240
And now we've gotten to that point

143
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,160
where we're looking for a disaster to call us

144
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,480
into being a country again.

145
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,000
That's right.

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,080
And our elites are inherently transnational.

147
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,920
We don't have any.

148
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,040
So the elites aren't.

149
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,760
Sitting in an elite chair does not

150
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,480
make you elite any more than sitting

151
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,440
in a pilot seat in a plane gives you the ability to fly it.

152
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,840
Somebody once asked George Burns, do you play the violin?

153
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,640
He says, I don't know, I never tried.

154
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,600
You want an elite surgeon for your child's heart operation.

155
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,960
You want elite commandos to go in and take the bad guys out

156
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,480
without hurting anybody else.

157
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,240
But we don't want an elite anywhere else,

158
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,280
because we keep hearing about the elite, the elite, the elite.

159
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,800
Well, they aren't.

160
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,400
Is it safe to say that Wall Street consulting and big tech

161
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,280
are all good examples where the incentives

162
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,120
around protecting America, those are after self-enrichment?

163
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,920
You've picked three really interesting, weird examples.

164
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,480
Because these are like the only places where

165
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,840
smart college graduates can reliably

166
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,120
go to earn six figures if they're willing to work themselves

167
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,520
to a crisp.

168
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,680
And that's the only way to not have debt, basically,

169
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,120
is to do one of those three things.

170
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,880
Well, you didn't mention porn or cannabis.

171
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,280
That was also possible new creation.

172
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,760
Well, look, I did this program with Sugar Baby University.

173
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,440
And I tried to shock the boomers and say,

174
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,840
you do realize that you're selling your daughters

175
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,440
into gray area prostitution through sugar dating.

176
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,640
And they don't even hear it.

177
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,880
You ask your kids going to college campuses,

178
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,760
how many people are sugaring in order

179
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,000
to make sure that they graduate without debt.

180
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,800
And it's an open secret among the kids.

181
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,480
There's not much of anything left, Jesse.

182
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,720
What we're doing is we're watching the decay of things

183
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,400
that were built by previous generations.

184
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,960
And we're not excited to get up off the couch.

185
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,160
Is there any way to reboot any of these institutions?

186
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,680
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

187
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,240
How do we do that?

188
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Well, first of all, you have to pick one.

189
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,200
We don't know which one.

190
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,640
We don't know how.

191
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,880
But assume that you could take back one.

192
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,800
And you gave it the ability to say no.

193
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,360
It'd be very easy, for example, to endow a university

194
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,040
to just insulate it.

195
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,600
We're going to take the most dangerous safe thinkers, who

196
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,240
actually have new ideas that are reasonable and not

197
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,320
mean-spirited.

198
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,320
And we're going to make sure that they're not

199
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,800
subject to market forces.

200
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,960
So they can do whatever they want and protect them.

201
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,360
But you have individuals who are still not dead.

202
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,520
That's a great segue into you've attempted to almost

203
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,200
do the impossible, which is to coalesce these sort of

204
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,760
atomized truth-teller gadflies, where sometimes small

205
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,920
disagreements between the students and the students

206
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,520
sometimes small disagreements between them make it hard to

207
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,280
create a coherent unit.

208
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,560
And I think if I were to create one sort of pin for all

209
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,720
of it, you might be it.

210
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,880
How do you do that?

211
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,000
We try it.

212
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,360
It works vaguely.

213
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,000
But you need brick and mortar.

214
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,520
And you need people who are empowered.

215
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,920
And you need people with stakes in the game.

216
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,800
I get very bored of saying this, because it doesn't do

217
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,320
good things for me.

218
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,880
Yes, I am trying to coalesce people.

219
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,080
But let's be honest, nobody wants to put FU money into

220
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,960
people who actually say FU.

221
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,840
You're not comfortable with actual heroes.

222
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,480
I think that's right.

223
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,840
I mean, your line on it is Charles Lindbergh is our last

224
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,600
hero.

225
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,960
Well, he was a scoundrel.

226
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,560
He was a scoundrel.

227
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,080
He was a scoundrel.

228
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,760
He didn't like our people.

229
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,440
He did not.

230
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,400
But the point was, he was a national hero who had the

231
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,960
power to lead the country out of a war orientation and say

232
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,880
this is a Jewish-British problem, America first.

233
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,800
And the idea that an individual would amass that

234
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,000
kind of power was something I think that we, the

235
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,080
government, we officialdom, learned we can't have anymore.

236
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,160
And it feels like there's a general malaise among my

237
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,400
generation and Gen Z to some extent.

238
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,760
Millennials own 4.8% of the wealth in this country.

239
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,000
Look at a city like LA, real wages have basically

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,920
stagnated, maybe risen slightly.

241
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,760
And then cost of living has 20 to 30x if you just take real

242
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,080
estate or something like that.

243
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,440
Doesn't fucking make any sense anymore.

244
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,160
And you guys need to fall in love with each other and get

245
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,560
each other pregnant and deal with the responsibility of the

246
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,960
consequences of those actions.

247
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,880
And you're not equipped.

248
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,040
And as I'm fond of saying, I love you guys not as much as I

249
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,840
love Gen Z.

250
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,720
Gen Z is my children, right?

251
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,560
So you guys are my audience, but Gen Z is my kids.

252
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,480
So I love you, but not as much as Gen Z.

253
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,320
Your parents don't love you as much as I love you guys, and

254
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,560
that's what kills me.

255
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,720
All of that is basically algorithmic, and it's the

256
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,880
algorithms that break your heart.

257
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,440
You don't realize that Pachelbel is emotional because

258
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,680
it's not even music.

259
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,920
It's math.

260
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,880
So the reason that it's your parents' wedding song is that

261
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,800
your parents wanted people to feel.

262
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,440
So they chose an algorithm.

263
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,680
Let's talk about boomer neglect.

264
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,480
Who understands these people?

265
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,640
No one.

266
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,760
You had to go through what they went through to understand

267
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,720
their crazy mindset.

268
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,600
And I don't mean to say that individually, we don't have

269
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,360
lovely relationships with them.

270
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,200
We do.

271
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,440
But they went through something.

272
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,680
What did they go?

273
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,480
Because it feels like, in some sense, they

274
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,400
went through nothing.

275
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,600
They benefited from massive growth post-World War II.

276
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,320
46 through 64 is the rough sort of range.

277
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,760
And so that, I feel like, creates all sorts of weird

278
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,640
psychological dynamics where you're given, if you were to

279
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,400
buy real estate between the 50s and the 80s and on the

280
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,720
coasts, the amount of wealth you accrue just through that.

281
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,280
Right.

282
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,040
Our whole story is off.

283
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,120
One, the greatest generation, which supposedly won World War

284
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,160
II by fighting the Germans hand-to-hand and blocking the

285
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,880
tube, by fighting the Germans hand-to-hand and blah, blah,

286
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,840
blah, always ignores that the Soviets did a ton, and the

287
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,000
physicists finished it off in Japan.

288
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,840
So yeah, we took casualties.

289
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,240
And people went through things, and they saw things.

290
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,880
But we didn't go through Stalingrad.

291
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,080
So first of all, you have this problem that a lot of GIs came

292
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,040
back home as the conquering heroes who didn't see the kind

293
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,680
of action, let's say, that the Soviets saw.

294
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,600
Then you have the silent generation that follows the

295
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,920
greatest generation, which actually, Joe Biden comes from

296
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,680
that generation.

297
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,080
We've gone backwards from boomers into the silence now.

298
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,280
And they sort of grow up with this post-World War II

299
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,160
prosperity that they can't get to work.

300
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,760
So Joe Biden begins as a 29-year-old senator in 1972.

301
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,680
And then the boomers are like after this, and they're set to

302
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,160
be the first generation that can't get the

303
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,040
American dream to work.

304
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,640
And because of the culture of personal responsibility, the

305
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,440
idea of just failing at the American dream,

306
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,200
it's like not an option.

307
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,440
So China becomes the source of the American dream.

308
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,960
It's really the Chinese dream of getting wealthy Americans to

309
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,920
sell things off to China so that they can pretend to live

310
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,680
better than their parents in a weird way.

311
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,920
So then what's Gen X?

312
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,360
We're the jet-washed generation.

313
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,160
We follow the boomers and the silence.

314
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,520
We get a chance to see the world that they sort of saw.

315
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,600
We're the last ones to have any vision of

316
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,040
functional journalism.

317
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,800
I remember functional journalism from when I was

318
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,120
five in Vietnam.

319
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,000
And we grow up in a 75-year peace bubble.

320
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,200
So we don't know reality.

321
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
You guys know less about reality because you didn't

322
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,000
even see the tail end of functional society.

323
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,080
And Gen Z is looking at all of us and saying, are you all just

324
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,840
effing crazy?

325
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,760
So if something close to 40% of the wealth that millennials

326
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,520
hold is in one set of hands of a guy who's on a hydrofoil with

327
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,160
an American flag for July 4th saying, hey, we've got a

328
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,320
terrible labor shortage.

329
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,360
Please give me all the visas so I don't actually have to

330
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,680
pay my workers, no.

331
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,560
You can't do that.

332
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,120
Because that's an advertisement for

333
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,640
redistribution of wealth.

334
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,640
If you want an unequal society as I do, where different

335
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,480
levels of ability and different levels of drive and

336
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,800
risk management are rewarded at different levels, it can't

337
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,600
be this dumb.

338
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
This is an argument for communism.

339
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,360
Our current capitalism is an argument for communism.

340
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,800
We need a capitalism that is an argument for capitalism.

341
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,320
Is there a point at which if you're a burgeoning tech

342
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,800
entrepreneur and you start to scale and you start to make

343
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,920
money and you start to connect with people at high levels of

344
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,960
society, you just sort of become co-opted and all of

345
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,440
your ideas go out the window?

346
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,720
Nobody plans for what success is going to do to them.

347
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,520
We talked about this earlier on the car ride over.

348
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,400
It's sort of a scilla and charybdis a

349
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,280
young person has to face.

350
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,480
And on the one hand, it's work on scholarly academic things

351
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,160
but don't get any support.

352
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,920
You can't really do too many interesting things.

353
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,400
Or it's go into commercial activity, try to make as much

354
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,360
money as possible, but lose the plot.

355
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,440
But what are you doing?

356
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,240
I'm attempting to marry the two.

357
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,080
And it's a tightrope act.

358
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,200
And I don't know if I'm going to pull it off.

359
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,520
That's why I'm here.

360
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,160
Thank you, Eric.

361
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,080
No, because this is an amazing idea.

362
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,840
If you can not get sucked in to doing cool stuff that gets

363
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,000
you clicks, and keep in mind, you're going to get captured

364
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,840
by your audience.

365
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,560
If you confuse these two things, then you can

366
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,320
potentially do something financial that creates the

367
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,320
monetary input to allow you to do something scholarly that

368
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,280
allows you to gain insight to inform your ability to make

369
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,760
more money.

370
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,720
If you can get that figure eight thing going, that's the

371
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,840
holy grail.

372
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,560
Let's talk about another example of this in Elon Musk.

373
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,920
I think you both have the same premise but then come to

374
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,840
almost vastly different conclusions as to what to do

375
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,800
about that premise.

376
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,720
He seems to think that we need to get off this earth with

377
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,080
physical rockets.

378
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,320
He thinks that we need to get off this earth.

379
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,280
Let's start there.

380
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Yes.

381
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,120
Same premise.

382
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,040
The same premise.

383
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,680
We don't know if he thinks that it's with rockets or rockets

384
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,320
is the best he can do.

385
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,640
If you believe that humans have to diversify because a

386
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,280
single planetary surface effectively creates one

387
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,960
synchronized experiment, you'd have to ask how many

388
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,240
different ways are there of getting off of this planet.

389
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,760
And there's getting off with the chemistry and physics that

390
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,120
we know, which is rockets.

391
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,200
And we know that that's good enough for the moon.

392
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,080
And marginally, it may be good enough for Mars.

393
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,720
Super tough to imagine that working, but OK.

394
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,360
You can imagine a space station or two.

395
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,600
You can even go crazier and imagine Titan around Saturn.

396
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,240
But Elon's a physics guy.

397
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,480
He's got a physics background.

398
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,240
The other great option is to say Einstein recovered Newton

399
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,680
in a limit.

400
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,040
You may be able to evade faster than light problems

401
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,680
because faster than light is about space time.

402
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,520
That's an Einsteinian concept.

403
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:14,280
GU is intended to say, here are some extra parameters that

404
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,560
you've never had access to that can

405
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,960
recover relativity theory.

406
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,000
Relativity might live within something broader.

407
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,440
Right.

408
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,640
And in GU, you can say exactly where it lives.

409
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,560
Now, that's an insanely exciting prospect.

410
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,120
And you went on Joe Rogan and presented this to the world.

411
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,360
This is all very hard for the average person to follow.

412
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,440
But I think it's incredibly valuable

413
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,280
to just release it for the average.

414
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,200
I'm sorry to everybody.

415
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,840
And this is my cursory understanding.

416
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,200
But it feels like there are, what, five people on Earth

417
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,480
or something who can even try to read this stuff.

418
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,920
Maybe there are no people on Earth.

419
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,640
I don't know.

420
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,560
How do you get this stuff out?

421
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,480
People don't understand what I did or why I did it.

422
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,080
Because it's different enough and it was weird enough

423
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,280
that they didn't grasp it.

424
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,720
It wasn't about teaching Joe Rogan physics inside of a show.

425
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,840
It's about the fact that there is no way now

426
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:25,200
to go back and take that theory away because there's

427
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,360
a record of when it happened.

428
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,400
And the reason that Joe Rogan's program is so important

429
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,880
is it has so many eyeballs on it.

430
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,800
So I think that there's a famous scene in one

431
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,320
of the Mission Impossible movies where Tom Cruise has to meet

432
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,200
with people who want him dead.

433
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,840
And he chooses to meet in a public square.

434
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,320
And he's got the only copy of the information

435
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
inside of his head so that killing him

436
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,120
will destroy the information.

437
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,240
In essence, that's the sort of a problem.

438
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,680
Academics has become so poisonous,

439
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,480
so focused on enforcing the rules that nobody

440
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,680
can afford to think.

441
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,160
In order to get things right, you have to get things wrong.

442
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,000
And we won't allow people to get things wrong

443
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,160
unless it's part of a program that's been blessed.

444
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,240
So that was a time stamped ubiquitously scene.

445
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,160
That was the point of it.

446
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,320
People didn't understand it.

447
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,120
The other thing is that there are no protections

448
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,120
inside of science for taking somebody else's work

449
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,120
and putting another person's name on it.

450
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,280
This was a good protection.

451
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,520
Well, and I put something saying that I

452
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,600
choose to be an entertainer rather than a scientist.

453
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,280
And therefore, it has copyright protection.

454
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,120
Where do we go from here on GU in terms of?

455
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:46,160
Somebody is going to have to actually grasp

456
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,400
the ideas inside of GU.

457
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,640
But here's the thing, Jesse.

458
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,000
I don't really care about the interpersonal.

459
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,240
I want a nice life.

460
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,720
I want my family left alone.

461
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,600
And I want to be insulated, so I don't need to worry every day.

462
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,080
But it's the ideas.

463
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,400
If the ideas in GU are wrong, then they're just wrong.

464
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,200
If the GU ideas are right, but there are small errors,

465
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,480
as there have been every time anybody's accomplished anything

466
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,840
in this kind of a way, fine.

467
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,600
Not a big deal.

468
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Let's fix some errors.

469
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,320
But people have these weird things that they want to do.

470
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,720
They want to turn this into drama.

471
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,280
So for example, Einstein and Hilbert.

472
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,560
Supposedly, Hilbert almost scooped Einstein,

473
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,640
but Einstein pulled it out of the, no.

474
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,920
Nothing like this remotely happened.

475
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,840
Einstein and Grossman were on general relativity.

476
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,240
Hilbert did something.

477
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,200
Even if Hilbert had gotten there first, it wouldn't have

478
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,000
mattered, the ideas were from Einstein.

479
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,160
We want to create moronic horse races because it's exciting.

480
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,960
You have like eight different frames.

481
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,760
Like you can go, yeah, you could talk to a biologist.

482
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,560
You can talk to a physicist.

483
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,960
You can talk math.

484
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,120
You're a cultural commentator.

485
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,480
And so I might have annoyed the shit out of you in the

486
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,360
process of trying to get you to start the portal.

487
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,120
No, the issue is I didn't want to become famous.

488
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,840
I wanted my ideas to become famous, and I wanted to be the

489
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,520
owner of those ideas.

490
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,400
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't know that the problem

491
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,280
isn't getting the ideas out there.

492
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,520
You can get the ideas out there.

493
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,080
The problem now is that the ideas are like seeds that need

494
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,320
to find soil and rain and the proper temperature.

495
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,720
We don't have that at the moment.

496
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,680
We have a world in which you can teach a person to fish.

497
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,520
You're not even giving them fish.

498
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,160
You can teach them to fish, and they will starve for lack

499
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,560
of, like they won't understand that when you're gone, they

500
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,440
have to go fish.

501
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,400
We don't have culture that's proper.

502
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,040
It's really important to understand how

503
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,160
counterintuitive the US, where we live, is as an

504
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,800
intellectual system.

505
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,760
We expect you to not take advantage of all of the

506
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,880
freedoms that we give you.

507
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,480
The purpose of freedom is not understood by people.

508
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,080
I often compare it to things like freedom,

509
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,040
potential, and sperm.

510
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,640
You're not supposed to use all of it.

511
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,320
So you have potential.

512
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
You could do anything in your life.

513
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,840
But you're not going to both become an opera singer and a

514
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:41,480
Formula One driver and a nutrient company CEO, and

515
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

516
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,720
You're not going to get to do everything.

517
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,600
Every life is about the forgoing of opportunity.

518
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,080
There's something about the hard choice thing that seems

519
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,920
lost on my generation.

520
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,200
We seem to all have an illusion of omnipossibility.

521
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,280
And that's all you've been given.

522
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,400
You've been given your future because you're not being

523
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,080
given your present.

524
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,280
And the future that you're being given is

525
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,400
largely illusory.

526
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,880
And that thing is making me crazy, because I would rather

527
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,040
deal you guys in on a future that's real.

528
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,280
My favorite tweet that I let off recently was something

529
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,800
about, for all of you who decided to have a kid during

530
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
coming, I have to be careful not to tear up on camera, but

531
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,680
people started sending me ultrasounds.

532
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,760
We've got two in the oven.

533
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,000
We have to thank you for telling us to have kids.

534
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,280
And I realized, nobody's yelling at you guys, get

535
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,840
married, have the babies.

536
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,600
Yes, it all sucks.

537
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,320
You don't have the money.

538
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,240
Don't waste your fertility windows.

539
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,960
Don't waste your ability to form families.

540
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,440
Yes, it's tough.

541
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,880
And there is divorce, and things go wrong, and people

542
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,720
come to hate each other.

543
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,800
But you know what?

544
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,960
A lot of those dysfunctional families are still families.

545
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,920
Family is barely doable, but it is barely doable.

546
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,640
And quite honestly, I want to see you guys dealt in.

547
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:14,520
And for me, the thing I like least about being famous is

548
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,760
having a family, because you can't protect your, there's

549
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,880
so many psychopaths in the world.

550
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,640
And it doesn't mean that there's like tens of thousands

551
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,080
of psychopaths, but it just takes a small

552
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,840
amount of psychopathy to get you to really come to look at

553
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,080
this fame question differently.

554
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,840
I think it's very interesting to think about media as sort

555
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,680
of, not a loss leader, maybe it's a loss leader, maybe it's

556
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,080
break even, but you're creating a lighthouse for

557
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,800
really young, high agency people.

558
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,720
And then you invest in them.

559
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,600
And venture economics might be riskier, but they're a whole

560
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,280
lot better than ads and the BuzzFeed model.

561
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,520
And so is the media company of the future actually media as

562
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,920
kind of the front, and then the back end is investing?

563
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,760
Well, that's the funnel theory.

564
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,400
And my belief about this was there's clearly a roll up play

565
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,680
where you take the people that people want to listen to, and

566
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,720
you put them inside a container, and then you let

567
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,520
the rest of the system hate on it.

568
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,320
And it's not Fox News because it's not conservative.

569
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,560
It's an easy play.

570
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,720
I don't know why it doesn't happen.

571
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,080
They don't understand where we are.

572
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,000
I just don't know the people who want to do it.

573
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,840
We should do it.

574
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,400
Let's do it.

575
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,800
OK.

576
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,680
I want to talk about UFOs, a subject which, if I brought

577
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,000
this up with you three years ago, you probably would have

578
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,680
said, Jesse, shut the hell up.

579
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,800
Well, you did try to bring it up.

580
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,760
What did happen?

581
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,840
You said, Jesse, shut the hell up.

582
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,280
Yeah, except you used the word hell.

583
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,120
No, you didn't.

584
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:57,280
But I think reasonably, you were like this wacky and crazy.

585
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,640
It's dumb.

586
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,160
It's incredibly dumb.

587
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,960
The idea that you would have phenomena that can only be

588
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,640
seen by special people, and that there's no good video of

589
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,120
it, and we have a world full of smartphones, we've got a

590
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,880
video of absolutely everything, is completely

591
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,800
stupid and insane.

592
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,600
And I was wrong.

593
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,440
What's changed since?

594
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,440
Nine pages came out from the Pentagon, six of which are

595
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,920
relevant, three, I think, like a cover and a back page.

596
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,600
I don't know what it is.

597
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,080
And it's very clear in that report that that report was

598
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,080
meant to be as dull as is humanly possible about the

599
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,120
most exciting thing that you could possibly imagine, which

600
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,120
is that either we're engaged in an incredible psychological

601
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,360
operation coming out of the Pentagon, or some people

602
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,600
inside the Pentagon believe with near certainty that we've

603
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:55,000
been contacted and observed by extraterrestrials

604
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,640
visiting Earth.

605
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,560
That's pretty insane.

606
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,240
And what's really crazy is that the data is locked up.

607
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,720
You just said, we talked about the government is not

608
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,360
attracting our best and brightest scientists.

609
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,840
Why are the top physicists in the country, why are the top

610
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,200
astronomers in the country not looking at?

611
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,800
Nobody that I know who's very good at physics, or

612
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,320
astrophysics, or astronomy, or anything, knows what the

613
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,440
hell's going on.

614
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,640
And I've never seen anything remotely like this, Jesse.

615
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,400
I thought you were completely wrong.

616
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,000
This is a situation where you would not come off of this

617
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,280
point, and I was convinced that you were brain damaged on

618
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,240
this one issue.

619
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,480
No, I really was.

620
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
And you were right.

621
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,640
I was wrong.

622
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,800
I don't understand it.

623
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,480
The key thing is whatever's going on is non-Copernican.

624
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,480
We're not in a situation where we all have equal access to

625
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,320
the same thing.

626
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,840
Either it's a PsiOp and almost nobody has

627
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
information about it.

628
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,760
Or there's something out there that fits this paradigm that

629
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,360
is not trying to be noticed.

630
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,800
And I've given the example of North Sentinel Island, where

631
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,120
India manages North Sentinel Island but doesn't land there.

632
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,000
And in such a circumstance, there would be a Fermi paradox

633
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,240
among the natives of North Sentinel Island.

634
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,800
Why don't we see anybody almost ever?

635
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,960
And the answer is, well, you're sort of owned.

636
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,920
And you're being protected from anybody

637
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,240
landing on your shores.

638
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,200
Now, if that's what's going on, that's astounding.

639
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,880
That's astounding.

640
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,680
On the other hand, if humanity has a future, and I'm right,

641
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,240
so I'm happy to give you your due, but give me mine, we have

642
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,400
a future because we got off this planet and we diversified.

643
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,360
Now, if we got off this planet and diversified, and that's

644
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,560
how we survive, then it means anyone else out there could

645
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,080
come here, and not with rockets.

646
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
We're pretty sure that they're not on the moon, and they're

647
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,680
not on Mars, and secret colony, I would imagine.

648
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,640
Do you have a sense on the genetic stuff?

649
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,520
It feels like a lot of people are just waiting for the data

650
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,320
to come in.

651
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,800
And they talk a lot about bioinformatics.

652
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,080
It's just a big sort of pattern matching issue.

653
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,960
And as long as we have genetic sequences, and we're matching

654
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,640
them with phenotypes, and we get this big harmonized

655
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,080
database, right now it exists in a bunch of silos.

656
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,600
You have BGI, UK Biobank, whatever, we just put them all

657
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,920
together, and then we know exactly the genetic code.

658
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,520
I tend to think that's not the case.

659
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,840
It's not just a data collection problem.

660
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,640
Do you have sort of an opinion on that?

661
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,800
It's very interesting what's going on with machine learning

662
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,920
on something like protein folding, where if you manage to

663
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,280
attack something with machine learning, you don't always

664
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,320
understand why you were able to solve what your machine

665
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,920
was able to solve.

666
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:06,800
It's very hard to interpret a successful neural net, right?

667
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,560
What did it find?

668
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,720
What did it understand?

669
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,600
Black box.

670
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,520
Somewhat.

671
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,840
Maybe we'll get to the point where you can

672
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,000
inspect the black box.

673
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,440
I don't know.

674
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,840
But one thing you can say is that, OK, if you can get

675
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,120
better at protein folding using some sort of a deep

676
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,840
learning system, then there's probably something there that

677
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,080
can be understood analytically.

678
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,400
So I'm excited about some of the data science.

679
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,640
But people are really looking for data science

680
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,000
to replace thinking.

681
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,240
Totally.

682
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,680
And it's very interesting, because the old issue with

683
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,960
artificial intelligence was trying to get something to be

684
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,160
intelligent.

685
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,360
The dirty little secret is intelligence was needed for

686
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,280
almost nothing.

687
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,560
So with mere deep learning, you were able to do all sorts

688
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,320
of things that we previously thought may have

689
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,400
required intelligence.

690
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,680
I think a line I have on AI is it's like the Daft Punk song,

691
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,240
harder, better, faster, stronger.

692
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,560
And that's all it can do.

693
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,160
It can do what humans can do.

694
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,240
And sometimes it's harder, better, faster, stronger.

695
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,040
Sometimes it's not even as good as humans.

696
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,120
But that is different than innovation.

697
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,920
Brute force is different than innovation.

698
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,640
Whenever I see a startup that says we're resting on some

699
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,640
data set or AI to create innovation, I'm always fairly

700
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,600
skeptical of it just being a data collection problem.

701
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,360
I think real innovation is inter-domain knowledge and

702
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,120
conciliance.

703
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,240
GU, for you, is inter-domain knowledge.

704
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,160
And so I don't think AI is very good at that right now.

705
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,360
You know, it's not a morality play.

706
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:54,440
You see, I love the romance of science where Jim Watson and

707
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,920
Francis Crick are able to figure this thing out that

708
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,560
Linus Pauling cannot.

709
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,080
That's one thing.

710
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,400
But sometimes you can easily imagine that the problem

711
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,560
wasn't what you thought it was.

712
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,080
It was much easier.

713
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,560
Or you could prove that it's undecidable or

714
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,000
something like this.

715
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,480
So you have to sort of not overlay what is true with what

716
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,920
is meaningful.

717
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,600
It would be great if human intelligence had a place going

718
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,840
forward for the rest of eternity.

719
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,480
But I think that you'll get to the point where the songs

720
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,480
that you love are written by computers.

721
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,760
And it's going to flip you out.

722
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,760
And then the question is going to be, well, do you start

723
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,280
caring less and less about music the way we care less and

724
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,920
less about chess?

725
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,320
What does it really mean if two chess machines go at it?

726
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,880
Do we really want to play through this as if this is

727
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,680
speaking to the human soul?

728
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,600
I don't know about that.

729
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,000
I do think that none of this really matters.

730
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,040
We have a very brief window to save ourselves.

731
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,240
And the way out is super romantic.

732
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,800
It's beautiful.

733
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,040
But we're not motivated.

734
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,000
It's like nobody wants to follow David Goggins.

735
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,520
Nobody wants to follow Jocko Willink.

736
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,640
Those guys want to get up at 4 in the morning

737
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,200
and start training.

738
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,920
And I don't see that on behalf of our scientific community.

739
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,080
And I don't think the machines at least can search while

740
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:29,680
everybody else pops an edible and watches Netflix.

741
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,960
Maybe AI, which is one of the few areas where people say

742
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,160
things are accelerating, is actually just a form of

743
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,080
learned helplessness and outsourcing our agency.

744
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,000
I think it is.

745
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,320
I think that at some level, we're going to find that it's

746
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,280
not good enough to know whether things are true or

747
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,400
that something can do them.

748
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,000
We're going to want to know why things are true.

749
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,360
And I think that that's part of the game is what if we can

750
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,600
actually predict protein folding fairly well, but

751
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,600
nobody has any idea of how we're able to do that?

752
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,760
How much is that going to actually hold us back?

753
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,920
And so I do think that we're going to get to a point where

754
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,200
we've learned some things and we're now angry that we don't

755
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,840
know why the things that we know how to do, we just don't

756
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,040
know why we know how.

757
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:27,240
And I think that that kind of ruthless pragmatism eventually

758
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,840
will cause itself its own problem.

759
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,360
We'll be too powerful with too little wisdom.

760
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,840
We're going to have all sorts of things that we know how to

761
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,800
do that we're going to have unintended consequences of

762
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
because we don't know how it's working.

763
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,400
We don't understand the bedrock foundation.

764
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,160
I agree with you, sir.

765
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,840
OK.

766
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,600
Let's go eat.

767
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,840
Let's go eat.

768
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,840
What kind of cheese for your cheeseburger?

769
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,240
It's American cheese.

770
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Can I get a hamburger with lettuce only?

771
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
That's going to be $15.72.

772
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,240
Cool, man.

773
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:04,740
Thanks.

774
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,740
Are you going paleo?

775
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,240
Yeah, you got a lettuce wrap.

776
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,240
Right?

777
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
I don't know what I got.

778
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,640
Here's something I've been thinking about recently.

779
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,440
An ironic effect of Snowden is there are all these

780
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,140
revelations.

781
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,240
You had prism, bull run, heartbeat.

782
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,640
The NSA has a back door into everything, was the

783
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,680
revelation.

784
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,520
And then we didn't do anything about it.

785
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,640
And think about the pinopticon effect that ends up having on

786
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,800
an individual, where it's like we know that they can hear and

787
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,480
listen to everything that we do and say, and it's indexed

788
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,720
and searchable.

789
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,200
And then we're not really doing anything about it.

790
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,800
The half-silvered mirror only works if the people behind the

791
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,200
half-silvered mirror rarely, if ever, intrude into your life

792
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,800
in a distinct, identifiable fashion.

793
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,200
So I think that the new thing that we believe is different.

794
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,000
I think that the new thing that we believe is, yes, they're

795
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,560
watching us, but for some reason, they can't afford to

796
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,480
let us know what they know.

797
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,120
So most of the information that they have is useless.

798
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,080
Because you'd be crazy to sacrifice the whole program to

799
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:32,240
go after somebody with an unpaid library fine.

800
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,840
What are you excited about, like crazily excited about that

801
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,080
doesn't involve money?

802
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,120
I think there are certain anomalies, and I'm not excited

803
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,440
about those things in their current form.

804
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,120
But I want to do them in a more rigorous way.

805
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,600
So like the UFO thing, stuff like that.

806
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,920
Make 12 figures just to be safe.

807
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,160
12 figures.

808
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,400
Yeah.

809
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,920
We can put that back there.

810
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
First of all, L'chaim, my friend.

811
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,400
L'chaim.

812
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,240
There's a way in which, growing up in Los Angeles,

813
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,960
the primary association is that home is alienation.

814
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,360
In some sense, I don't feel like I'm home unless I'm in a

815
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,880
place of alienation.

816
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,440
It's sort of like I likened it to growing up in a

817
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,800
D'Curico painting, some industrial landscape where

818
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,960
you've abandoned everything.

819
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,320
There's a child with a hoop running down the street.

820
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
There's nothing.

821
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,600
And for me, in a weird way, the doors are maybe the

822
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,360
quintessential L.A.B.

823
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,280
Of course, you had the birds and all that kind of stuff.

824
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:35,840
Yeah.

825
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,080
Speaking of the doors and great music, you know I live in

826
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,520
Laurel Canyon.

827
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,640
There's a pretty amazing music history there.

828
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,080
Are you aware of it?

829
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,320
Some of it.

830
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,480
I mean, I definitely go to the store where the creatures

831
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,640
meet, and I'm familiar with the romance of Wunderland

832
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,440
Avenue and Carole King's Tapestry has been a place of

833
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,920
pilgrimage for me.

834
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,040
It's been a place of pilgrimage for myself and my

835
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,680
daughter, where she wrote it.

836
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,520
Laurel Canyon and Topanga Canyon are, to the extent that

837
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,360
L.A. has spiritual energy, probably the two places that

838
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,640
have the strongest spiritual energy.

839
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,080
It was such a weird place, too.

840
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,600
I mean, you know Jim Morrison's dad?

841
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,600
Rear Admiral Stephen Morrison was in the Navy and in charge

842
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,680
of the Gulf of Tolkien.

843
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,080
Really crazy.

844
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,920
That's a very strange one.

845
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,400
And as you point out, Lookout Mountain is a CIA facility in

846
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,640
Laurel Canyon, and the whole history of drugs and the

847
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,440
government and Vietnam and espionage and all this kind of

848
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,240
stuff, very hard to sort out.

849
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,160
Hard to sort out.

850
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,640
Very weird.

851
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,200
There are all these sort of anomalous, bizarre facts.

852
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,400
It feels like L.A. was a crazy place in the 80s.

853
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,200
It was dangerous.

854
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,840
It was exciting.

855
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,000
Now it feels like a weird Instagram hologram thing.

856
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You go to Bo's Steakhouse and there are TikTokers

857
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
everywhere or Saddle Ranch.

858
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,120
It feels like a weird place.

859
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,440
Every place is over.

860
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,240
OK.

861
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,280
And I mean that.

862
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,400
You can't move to New York and say it's happening in New

863
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,880
York, it's going down in Austin.

864
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,200
No, you're not getting it, man.

865
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,840
We're going to move to the Black Rock Desert.

866
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,600
Burning Man's going to be 365.

867
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,400
No, that's true.

868
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,640
No place is happening.

869
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,000
There are things that are happening, but they're

870
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,240
happening between people.

871
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,840
Sometimes they're happening between people who have never

872
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,920
actually met in person.

873
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,840
But I've always thought that secretly this was an

874
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,400
incredibly intellectual town.

875
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,520
Yeah, I think it's both.

876
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,120
I think there are many L.A.'s.

877
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:46,120
And that lack of identity, as frustrating as it can be to

878
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,440
deal with, makes me hopeful towards creating a Laurel

879
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:58,360
Canyon of tech, science, out there ideas, and cool shit.

880
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,120
I detect a spark of inspiration.

881
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:07,920
I think, in a weird way, I've come back after 37 years away.

882
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,640
I was conceived in Laurel Canyon.

883
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,200
I was born in what is now the Church of Scientology.

884
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,560
It used to be Cedars of Lebanon.

885
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
That's amazing.

886
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,760
And I ran away from this place at 16 so hard and so fast, I

887
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,840
never thought I would be back.

888
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,760
And I explored the world.

889
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,560
And I lived in places that I needed to.

890
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,480
I went back to Philadelphia, which was my family's

891
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,560
ancestral seat, to the extent that you can claim something

892
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,200
as immigrants in the US.

893
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,880
Went to Boston, which I thought was the center of

894
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,280
academics and science.

895
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,560
Moved to New York, which was hot for hedge funds.

896
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,680
At least it could support creativity and rule breaking.

897
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,160
Moved out to San Francisco to do tech.

898
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,920
Went to Jerusalem for two years because it's the belly

899
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,720
button of the universe.

900
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,440
And I think I came back to LA not quite sure why I was here

901
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,040
anymore.

902
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,560
What I think I've put together is it's

903
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,240
not happening anywhere.

904
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,040
It's happening wherever you happen to be and wherever you

905
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,120
can make it happen.

906
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,760
And there's no point in city chasing, right?

907
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,640
Something is pulling me towards Austin.

908
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,240
Somebody else is saying come to Montana, come to Miami.

909
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,400
I think at this late stage in the game,

910
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,520
I'm actually back home.

911
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,120
I'm from this place.

912
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,760
My son is the fifth generation now of Los Angelinos in our

913
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,120
family, which effectively never happens.

914
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:43,200
And whether it's the flood from the dam that burst in

915
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,680
Baldwin Hills or whether it's the 71 earthquake or the

916
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,720
Bel Air fire, in some sense, there was somebody from my

917
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,160
family here for all of those things.

918
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,720
And what I said to Brother Easton Ellis is LA is this

919
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,840
weird town where everybody has lived here.

920
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,600
Because if you've consumed media, so much of it is shot

921
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,160
in Los Angeles that you actually have a feel for this

922
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,840
place whether you live here or not.

923
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,680
And even though it sort of feels vapid and random and

924
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:23,320
pointless at times, I think about maybe its magic is that

925
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,480
it's several different things.

926
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,160
It's an oil field.

927
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,600
We live on an oil field.

928
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,160
It's an aerospace place, like the home of the

929
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,640
Rand Corporation.

930
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,320
It's not really clear that it's just entertainment.

931
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,280
Entertainment, yeah, once upon a time, maybe that was

932
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,480
really, really dominant.

933
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,360
But in a certain sense, it's just a big canvas.

934
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:51,120
And maybe a laurel canyon of heterodoxy for different

935
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,280
things, for science, for future-pointed culture that

936
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,800
isn't necessarily so easy to pin down to popular music.

937
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,600
Maybe it's time.

938
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,880
And maybe it can be done here.

939
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,240
But I think I'm home.

940
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,280
I can't follow that.

941
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,640
Eric, thank you for doing this.

942
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,880
Man, that was beautiful.

943
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,400
Let's end on that note.

944
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
Jesse, thanks for a great day.

945
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,160
I love you, man.

946
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,400
You too, man.
