1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
No expert in the world agrees with you.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,300
I know you're eager for Arrow to debunk this.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,100
There's zero evidence of what you're proposing.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,600
None.

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,600
This isn't debunking.

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,100
What we're seeing here is a curve.

7
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,100
It's basically a mathematical projection.

8
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,800
It's not.

9
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,400
Like, propose one plane that would fly like this.

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Well, why don't you propose one type of UFO?

11
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,400
The broader problem with ufology is that it's always been

12
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,400
the battle between hard evidence and cool stories.

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,600
There just happened to be a distant jet exactly where the close thing is?

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,400
Is that what you're saying?

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,400
Behind it somewhere.

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,900
Really?

17
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,100
You're very familiar with this theory of mine, right?

18
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,000
I think this is flinging to the crowd here a little.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,400
I've brought all the experts to you.

20
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,100
Bring some experts to the public.

21
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,800
Unfortunately, the stigma that you promote is a big part of why they don't want to come out.

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,500
These guys are fighting a stigma.

23
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,100
I encourage them to come forward.

24
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,100
Like, come forward and I won't laugh at you.

25
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,900
Different parts of the brain have different activities.

26
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,100
But you know that, don't you?

27
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,900
I know people that you don't love.

28
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,700
Maybe you should interview me.

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,200
I am here with Mick West and Merrick von Rennenkamp.

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,100
And this couldn't be better timing for this debate.

31
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,900
We planned this maybe a couple weeks ago.

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,200
Both of you are very well known.

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,300
Merrick, kind of on the pro side in certain cases where I wouldn't call you dogmatically, you know, pro UFO.

34
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:34,800
But there are a few videos that you've looked at where you think there's something substantial or worthy of investigation there.

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,000
And Mick has done an amazing job.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,800
I think you're doing a service of debunking a lot of UFO videos that just are clearly fake.

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:50,800
And so I'm honored to have you both here because I think you're both the most serious on this sort of, you know, this is a poor way of saying it.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
But pro and anti side.

39
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,800
And this couldn't be better timing, right?

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:03,600
It's just insane how many quote unquote drones we're seeing over Air Force bases all over the world right now.

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
And so, yeah, I'm very excited.

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,200
You kind of came on my radar because you publish in The Hill and you're a former DoD employee.

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,600
And so you kind of know that world.

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,900
And you were publishing really substantive pieces around some of these videos.

45
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,400
And you, Mick, have been doing this for how long?

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
Like five plus years or?

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,900
2016.

48
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,900
Since 2016.

49
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,300
And I think you've always done a pretty good job.

50
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,900
And I've heard things from, you know, UFO junkie friends of mine.

51
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,900
Like, oh, Mick's like a bad faith actor.

52
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,700
But all of our conversations we've had, I find you to be pretty earnest and cool.

53
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:51,400
So why don't you guys kind of introduce yourselves and tell the audience how you got into this sort of vigilante job of debunking or, you know, confirming UFO videos to begin with?

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
I'll start with you, Mick.

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,600
Well, Jesse, thanks for having us.

56
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,700
And Mick, thanks for being here.

57
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,200
So I will be very honest.

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,700
I didn't think about this topic.

59
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,600
I thought it was squarely in tinfoil hat territory.

60
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
This is not anything on my radar.

61
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,700
I missed the big 2017 story with Leslie Kane and Ralph Blumenthal.

62
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,100
It's just as a testament to how little I was tracking this.

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:29,500
But I did stumble upon, I think it was late 2019, the interview that Commander Fravor did on Joe Rogan.

64
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,700
And I previously worked at the Pentagon.

65
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,000
I worked with some Navy aviators, naval aviators, more rotary wing guys.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But I knew the type, the bravado, the way they carried themselves.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,300
And as soon as, you know, I watched five minutes of Fravor, and this guy is the real deal, right?

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,400
He's a skipper of a storied squadron out on the West Coast, VFA 41, Black Aces.

69
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,300
And he tells a pretty incredible story.

70
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,800
And oh, by the way, it wasn't just him, it was three other aviators that were out there.

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,400
And that was my ticket kind of down the rabbit hole.

72
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,500
And then believe it or not, Mick West has a lot to do with my kind of my interests in this topic.

73
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
We exchanged a whole lot of emails.

74
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,000
I think we did a few Zoom calls.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,600
Yeah, this is years ago.

76
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,500
And I'll just be transparent.

77
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,100
The deeper I dug into Mick's theories, first of all, I'll just say, who's this Mick West guy who thinks he knows more than the government?

78
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,700
Like, OK.

79
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,900
And there's some pretty deep nuance.

80
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:38,600
And from my perspective, I found, again, in my opinion, he was wrong about a lot of his theories.

81
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,300
And the deeper we dug, I'm like, my goodness, there's something to this.

82
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:51,600
And that was that was really kind of the kind of the twin tickets down the rabbit hole dug into the history and started writing articles about it.

83
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Awesome. And before we get to you, Mick, for context for the audience, we're going to be going over kind of the classic historic landmark cases.

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:11,000
So Nimitz FLIR videos or video rather, the Gimbal and GoFast videos, which were taken at the USS Roosevelt 300 miles off the coast of Jacksonville.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,200
Mick, what about you? How did you get into this?

86
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Well, I am a retired video game programmer with a very different background to Merrick.

87
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:25,400
And I after I retired, I took up writing and I was just doing stuff like writing for Game Develop magazine.

88
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:34,100
I eventually kind of moved into the skeptical arena, like investigating conspiracy theories, things like that.

89
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:44,300
One of the first things I did was I was on Wikipedia, just messing around with I used to edit Wikipedia about 18 years ago.

90
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:51,900
And I saw this article on the chemtrail conspiracy theory, which is this fun theory where the government spraying things behind planes.

91
00:05:51,900 --> 00:06:01,300
And we did some I did some work on that on my blog and that blog kind of evolved into my current site, Metabunk.org.

92
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,100
Metabunk is just a forum where you have lots of people just chatting about various different conspiracy theories.

93
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,100
It's kind of grown now to be more UFO focused.

94
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:17,500
But we have a lot of older stuff like 9-11 conspiracy theories, false flags and even the Flat Earth stuff.

95
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:24,900
But with the chemtrail stuff, I got really into doing things like tracking planes and trying to figure out what people were seeing in their videos.

96
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,100
And so after that, it became kind of a natural thing for me to start looking at UFO videos.

97
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:41,800
I occasionally did a few over the years, but it really kind of took off in I think it was 2016 or perhaps the start of 2017 with this case from Chile, Chilean Navy video.

98
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,000
And this is a video that looks really spectacular.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,900
It was released by Leslie King, who you mentioned, in the Huffington Post in 2016 and 2017.

100
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,000
And she was very effusive about how amazing it was.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,200
And me and a few other people looked into it, and we very quickly determined that she was wrong about that.

102
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,500
It wasn't that amazing.

103
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,400
And it was actually just a distant plane.

104
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
And we were able to prove that pretty conclusively.

105
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:14,200
Not everybody agrees straight away, but I think America would agree that case is pretty much solved.

106
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,300
And that really kind of got me hooked on UFOs.

107
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:25,900
And that kind of almost coincided with the 2017, December 2017 release of a New York Times article, which came with these other videos.

108
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,200
Gimbal and the FLIR 1 video and GoFast was released a little later.

109
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,800
And when I first looked at them, when I looked at the FLIR 1 video, it seemed very similar to this Chilean video.

110
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,700
And so I thought perhaps it's the same type of thing.

111
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,400
So I started delving into it.

112
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Turned out it wasn't exactly the same type of thing, but there were related aspects.

113
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:56,300
And I really enjoyed the process of investigating UFO videos because it was so similar to the work I used to do with video games, except kind of in reverse.

114
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,700
But use all the same mathematical techniques, all the analysis techniques.

115
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:05,500
Debugging and debunking are very similar things because they're both about finding the root cause of something.

116
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,700
And so I got hooked and I've been doing it ever since.

117
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,100
And I've done a whole bunch of different videos.

118
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,800
Merrick and I have agreements on several of these.

119
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,600
And we have disagreements on a few of them.

120
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:24,200
And I think a lot of the time those disagreements kind of fall in the videos that are somewhat more ambiguous.

121
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,700
And this is a problem in general with UFO videos.

122
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,300
But I'm keeping going.

123
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,200
I want to ask real quick before we get into the actual substance about kind of your priors.

124
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:42,600
Do you believe in the possibility of UFOs, notwithstanding the fact that you don't sort of agree that any of these videos are legit?

125
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,400
No, definitely.

126
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
I mean, I would certainly agree.

127
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,300
People ask me, do you believe aliens might exist?

128
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:54,200
And yeah, I think obviously in the universe, almost certainly, there's some type of alien life, probably some type of alien civilization.

129
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,700
I just don't see that there's good evidence of them visiting us here.

130
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,300
I wouldn't rule it out, but I just don't think there is good evidence of that happening.

131
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,200
OK, what about you, Merrick?

132
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,500
Previously, before I went down the rabbit hole, I was in McWest camp.

133
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,200
I thought the universe is exceptionally large.

134
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,800
We just cannot conceive how large it is.

135
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,700
And I firmly believe that there was life out there, not that it was here.

136
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:30,200
Fast forward over the last, I'd say, three, four years, I have done a deep dive into the history of this topic.

137
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,400
And I've read the raw case files, the raw blue book case file.

138
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,500
No analysis, just the straight reports.

139
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,500
And I've come to a very different conclusion.

140
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,100
I'm a big fan of James MacDonald.

141
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:51,100
I don't know if you guys are familiar with him, but very, very prominent figure in the history of this topic.

142
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,800
He's an atmospheric physicist.

143
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,800
I encourage anybody watching to read anything and everything that he has written.

144
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,100
Start with science in default.

145
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,800
It's a remarkable critique of the Condon committee, which we can get into.

146
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:16,000
But in his bottom line assessment was that the extraterrestrial hypothesis is the least unsatisfactory hypothesis

147
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,200
for what hundreds and thousands of people have observed at close range over the last 80 years in many cases.

148
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,600
I'd say I'm partial to that because of just the long historical record.

149
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,100
And I've got a ton of cases that I'd like to get into because I think they are related to some of these videos and we can talk about that.

150
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,600
Fellow alchemist, Lucy Breakers are changing the game for nicotine users.

151
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,400
If you're looking for 100% pure nicotine product that's tobacco free, Lucy Breakers are where it's at.

152
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,300
Each pouch has a cool twist.

153
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:54,000
Inside is a capsule that can pop to release an extra burst of flavor and hydration.

154
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,400
It's a unique experience that makes your nicotine routine more enjoyable and convenient.

155
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:06,500
As someone who delves into the most heretical thinkers and ideas of our time, I appreciate products that challenge the norm.

156
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,700
Lucy Breakers do just that.

157
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,200
My personal go-to flavor is mint.

158
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,400
Whether I'm deep into a podcast discussion, exploring new frontiers or brainstorming ideas,

159
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,900
throwing in a Lucy is an easy way to keep the day moving.

160
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,100
Plus, the flexibility and strengths lets you choose what suits you best.

161
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,900
Let's level up your nicotine routine with Lucy.

162
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:33,700
Go to lucy.co slash jesse and use promo code jesse to get 20% off your first order.

163
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,200
Lucy has a 30-day refund policy if you change your mind.

164
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,400
Again, that's lucy.co and use code jesse to get 20% off.

165
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,800
And here comes the fine print.

166
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,700
Lucy products are only for adults of legal age.

167
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,600
Every order is age verified.

168
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,200
Warning, this product contains nicotine.

169
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,400
Nicotine is an addictive chemical.

170
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,000
Thanks so much to Lucy for sponsoring today's episode.

171
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,800
So I think we should just dive into the footage and, you know, yeah.

172
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,100
Not to just interrupt, but I just want to quickly just acknowledge,

173
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,900
and again, I bring a historical kind of government perspective to this.

174
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,300
Can we just acknowledge what has happened over the last five years?

175
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,100
We've gone 80 years and we are literally at the 80-year anniversary of the first reports of foo fighters.

176
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,600
Like that happened November of 1944.

177
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,600
80 years of denial, ridicule, obfuscation to, and I love this quote from Mick,

178
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,900
June 20th, 2020.

179
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,200
This is when Rubio snuck a provision into, you know what we're talking about, right?

180
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,500
Stuck a provision into Senate Intelligence Committee language.

181
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,900
And Mick's quote is, years will pass.

182
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,300
It will recede in memory.

183
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,400
Little will come of it.

184
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,900
I assure you in June of 2020, I probably would have agreed with you.

185
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,700
Now we have Aero.

186
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,900
I think it's about three, four dozen.

187
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,700
We just heard yesterday with this week that they're at full operational capability.

188
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,600
Three, four dozen people working at a UFO office, right?

189
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,200
1600 cases as of last count.

190
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,500
And his director just came out and said, in essence, I'm baffled.

191
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,700
I have an engineering and science degree.

192
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,400
I'm baffled.

193
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,200
I don't know what's going on.

194
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,600
And I don't know anybody else who knows what's going on with some of these cases.

195
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,900
And that's pretty extraordinary.

196
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,900
He was a former NSA director.

197
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,900
He was an NSA scientist.

198
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,500
Scientist?

199
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,700
Yeah.

200
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,600
So it is pretty remarkable.

201
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,600
We had just about every single, we had former CIA directors, former national intelligence

202
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,700
directors, just extraordinary things.

203
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:35,500
You know, Radcliffe has said, UAP UFOs exhibit technologies that we do not have and cannot

204
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,500
defend against, right?

205
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,600
They appear to.

206
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,200
Right.

207
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,200
I'm just saying, I'm trying to acknowledge where we've come.

208
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,000
It is extraordinary.

209
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,100
It is astounding, right?

210
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,600
I don't think, I suspect, if I had shown you a picture of Dave Grush testifying under oath

211
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,800
with the former Inspector General of the Intelligence Committee sitting right behind him four

212
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,900
years ago when you wrote that tweet, you would probably thought I was crazier than I am.

213
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,400
Well, what I meant there, the nothing will happen was not that nothing would happen.

214
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,600
It was more that nothing would happen in terms of giving us evidence that aliens are visiting,

215
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,100
which is the thing they really want.

216
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,900
I'm actually really happy that we've got all this progress and we've got these investigations

217
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,900
that Arrow is doing a lot of work, even the spending millions of dollars on investigating

218
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,900
it, and hopefully they will release their information.

219
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,300
I don't think we've really got much further along the road in terms of actual evidence

220
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,300
of genuinely anomalous phenomena that didn't exist five years ago.

221
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,400
The stuff that Arrow's released, obviously, like people are disappointed with that.

222
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,700
And their overall assessment is, you know, there's no evidence of alien life.

223
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,500
Right.

224
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,000
We have lots of talk about things going on behind curtains and in skiffs and in secret

225
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,500
and things that people can't talk about.

226
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
And that's interesting.

227
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,300
But I think it kind of speaks to the broader problem with ufology is that it's always been

228
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:05,900
a bit of a battle between hard evidence, hard data, and cool stories.

229
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,500
We have a lot of really amazing eyewitness accounts.

230
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,700
A lot of the Blue Book stuff is eyewitness accounts, and there's very little that you

231
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,200
can actually get to this tangible data.

232
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,000
There's some data that's written down, but there isn't really very much we can actually

233
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,200
analyze.

234
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
And that's what we really need to move the conversation forward.

235
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,100
Having people come forward and say, you know, I worked on a program in the 60s that did

236
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,700
crash retrieval, I don't think it's really going to move the needle very much, unless

237
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,000
they can actually produce some evidence of something.

238
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's just more cool stories, which maybe they're true, maybe they're not.

239
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,700
But we can't actually do very much with them.

240
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,500
And that's always been the problem.

241
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,800
And then there's the intersection of the cool stories with the data, with the videos, which

242
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,600
we'll get into later, where people are talking about.

243
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,200
I'll give you two points that maybe give us a little bit of hope to really address your

244
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,700
point.

245
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,500
And I think Kozlowski has said, and the quote here is...

246
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,900
And Kozlowski is the director of ARRA, the new director.

247
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,000
Dr. Kozlowski is the new director of ARRA, which is the government's UFO analysis office.

248
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,100
And his direct quote is, we're going to need the help of academia and the public to address

249
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,700
some of these cases.

250
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,300
And he's pledged to release them.

251
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,400
Now, I'm skeptical, right?

252
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,700
I know how the government works.

253
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
They don't release anything.

254
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,000
They don't have to.

255
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,800
But he said this.

256
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,500
So just to address your point, maybe we'll see some more.

257
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,000
I don't know.

258
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,900
I think that's notable.

259
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:37,600
And then secondarily, Dr. Kozlowski in his hearing said that at least two multiple firsthand

260
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,100
witnesses have gone to ARRA.

261
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,500
Witnesses of what?

262
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,900
Unreported UAP programs.

263
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
That was the question from Gillibrand.

264
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,800
So anyway, we can go down that route a little bit.

265
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,200
I'm just saying the story of UFOs is, OK, there's something coming.

266
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,900
But there is.

267
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,900
We'll see.

268
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,700
But there is some chatter about it.

269
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,500
Mick, how do you, to Marek's point, there has been a lot of momentum if you're just

270
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,300
tracking social consensus, hype around this stuff.

271
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,100
I mean, I run a YouTube channel that really surrounds this topic.

272
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Particularly, I've seen a lot of interesting.

273
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,700
My site is all UFOs now.

274
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,000
Well, there you go.

275
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,700
So how do you explain that?

276
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,800
Do you think it's some sort of coordinated PsyOP?

277
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Do you think it's just this contagion mess, social psychosis thing?

278
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,400
What's going on?

279
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,800
I think it's something that was maybe bubbling beneath the surface.

280
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,300
And it's just been kind of allowed to come out.

281
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,200
The New York Times story basically opened the floodgates.

282
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,500
It was something that gave validity.

283
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,100
It allowed people to talk about it.

284
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,900
It allowed other journalists to talk about it.

285
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,500
And once you get that going, it becomes this kind of feedback loop.

286
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,800
People talk about it in the media.

287
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,700
The general public talks about it.

288
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,900
And then Congress gets involved because it's what people are interested in.

289
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:55,100
And then you can kind of push these things perhaps without the stigma that you had before.

290
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,500
And if there are things like unacknowledged SAP programs,

291
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,900
which I wouldn't rule out, of course.

292
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,200
It's entirely possible that people were running crash retrieval programs

293
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,100
for things that they thought were UFOs back in the day.

294
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,700
But perhaps some of those were under the radar.

295
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,800
We know the government has done dodgy things before in the past.

296
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,500
So that's the type of thing that should come to light.

297
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,800
There's the Church Commission.

298
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,600
Was it the Church Commission?

299
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Yeah, the Church Commission.

300
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,700
Yeah, something like that where we can actually get these things out.

301
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,200
And I've been really enthusiastic about people like David Grush testifying.

302
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,000
And I wish he would come out and actually say more.

303
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,600
Because I want this to come into the sunlight.

304
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,400
I want to know what's actually going on.

305
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
Well, that's your goal.

306
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,700
That's, I think, the goal of everybody here.

307
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:48,100
And I would love for this to either be falsified forever or corroborated.

308
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,900
That's not going to happen.

309
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,800
It's one of those things that's impossible to falsify,

310
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,000
because there's always the idea that that light over there might be an alien.

311
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,900
Well, what I would say.

312
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,300
You can prove it's true.

313
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,900
I think there's not a lot of daylight probably between us.

314
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,000
We're like, I think whatever is going on is interesting.

315
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,300
If it's mass social psychosis, a coordinated psyop.

316
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,800
I think those are extremely interesting because I think it's the best

317
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,100
psyop maybe of all time.

318
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,200
If it's a psyop or something.

319
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,800
Guys, we can talk about this for hours without even getting.

320
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,400
I will say the commentary, direct commentary, from Rubio, Gallagher,

321
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,100
Kirk McConnell, former Senate staffer, Sask, Sissy, sorry,

322
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,100
Senate Armed Services, and the Senate Intelligence Committees.

323
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,000
They have all stated.

324
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,700
Jill LeBrand, her first question in the hearing.

325
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,200
There are, as she said, there are reports that firsthand witnesses

326
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,600
are reluctant to go to the UFO, the Pentagon's UFO office.

327
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,000
Rubio has stated very clearly over and over,

328
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,100
these are credible people with high clearances and high positions

329
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,000
and they fear for their lives.

330
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,800
He said that on camera.

331
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,100
That's fascinating.

332
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,900
So if it's mass psychosis and people in high positions in government

333
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,200
are saying, yes, I was on a retrieval program,

334
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,800
then we have a major, major problem because they're just

335
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,500
fantasists out there that are in important positions.

336
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,300
And very sensitive areas.

337
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,000
I mean, the other thing I would say is say this is all unacknowledged

338
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,200
deep black programs.

339
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,600
I find that fascinating too.

340
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Absolutely.

341
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,900
Maybe it's a bit of both.

342
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,800
I mean, we do know that there are people in governments who are fantasists.

343
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,100
Not everybody who's in government or in the military is going to be

344
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,800
like on the level.

345
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,200
Well, the thing that I've found because I've met all these people

346
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,200
deep inside the government, you know, post doing this show,

347
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,500
they are often more conspiratorial than people who are civil side.

348
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,700
And that could be one of two things.

349
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,000
That could be like, oh, that like discredits them in some way.

350
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,800
Or it can be like they are somehow privy to a lot crazier stuff.

351
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,900
And that makes them more conspiratorial.

352
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,500
Mick, can I put you on the spot actually?

353
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:46,900
Sure.

354
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,600
Just curious.

355
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,200
When Grush says under oath, I had the firsthand people go to the

356
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,900
inspector general to submit a complaint.

357
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
Luis Elizondo goes under oath.

358
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
Yes, we have crash retrieval programs.

359
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,700
Rubio says, not under oath, but he says publicly in a very long interview,

360
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,200
firsthand witnesses, they fear for their lives.

361
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,700
Kirk and Connell has been tracking this and is convinced that there's

362
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,500
something to this.

363
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,300
I talked to a congressional source, told me, I asked point blank,

364
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,200
what's your confidence level in the existence of such programs?

365
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,000
The answer was hovering around 100%.

366
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,200
What am I as an analyst supposed to do with that?

367
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,500
What do you think?

368
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,600
I wouldn't be surprised if there were such programs.

369
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
I mean, this is something I've been saying for a while.

370
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,800
Sorry, and then it's NHI and it's non-human intelligence.

371
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,000
No, there's actually NHI there, but there's programs that existed

372
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
in the past possibly even now where some people who work on those

373
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,900
programs think that it's NHI.

374
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,800
It's quite clear from people like David Grush that people do actually

375
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,900
believe these things happen.

376
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,400
They believe that we have bodies.

377
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,900
They believe that we have crashed alien craft and they believe that

378
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,000
there are these programs to study them.

379
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,400
Maybe the programs exist, but what were they actually studying?

380
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,100
Why do you think the inspector general didn't just shut this down

381
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,900
immediately?

382
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,600
I have no idea.

383
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,800
I'm not really familiar with what the inspector general does.

384
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,600
But Grush's claims covered a range of things.

385
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,500
There was the whistleblower recriminations and it seems a little

386
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,500
bit mixed up as to what the inspector general was actually

387
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
investigating and what they're referring to when they said that.

388
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,200
Rubio is very clear.

389
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,900
He's the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence.

390
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,300
Rubio said that the unreported, the misuse of funds, that portion

391
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,800
of it, they didn't say anything about the reprisal part.

392
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,900
But the misallocation of funds was deemed credible energy.

393
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,900
Yeah, well, if there are unacknowledged special access programs,

394
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,500
I'd be happy to see them.

395
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,900
It's interesting because that's also unfalsified.

396
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,100
That's like also, and Feynman's not even wrong sort of category.

397
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,500
If they deny it, you can't, you can say they're lying.

398
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,200
If they admitted and show it, then that's one thing.

399
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,400
It's like anything.

400
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
You only need one.

401
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,300
You just need one ace to win the game.

402
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,900
But everything that's not an ace doesn't mean there's no aces.

403
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,800
So you think it's going to stay in this sort of liminal category

404
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,900
for a very long time?

405
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,100
I would hope it doesn't.

406
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,800
But I think all we can hope for really is to get more sunlight on it.

407
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,000
And if there is something there, something will eventually pop out.

408
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,200
And if there isn't something there, we will see that all the things

409
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,100
in the dark corners become illuminated and we see that there was nothing there.

410
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,600
And perhaps there's something in one of the dark corners that's really interesting.

411
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,200
That would be great.

412
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,900
How did non-human intelligence get into a bill sponsored by Chuck Schumer

413
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,300
and signed on to by Rubio, Gillibrand, former presidential candidates?

414
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,500
22 times.

415
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,500
And then biological evidence of non-human intelligence.

416
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,400
Oh, you should ask Schumer about that.

417
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,600
Schumer said he was doing it to honor the legacy of his friend, Harry Reid.

418
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,400
So he just randomly puts in aliens into 64 pages just because he's buddy?

419
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
I mean, maybe. I don't know.

420
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
He didn't do it.

421
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
His staffers did it. Some staffer did it.

422
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,600
Well, he put his name next to it, right?

423
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,900
He does that for everything, doesn't he?

424
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,400
But he doesn't write the legislation.

425
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,400
Does Schumer put his name next to Bigfoot legislation, right?

426
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
You go down the list.

427
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,700
Well, I think, okay, this is great.

428
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,200
I think we should get into, because this is all dealing with sort of social proof,

429
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,500
which does carry for a lot of people, we should get into first principle.

430
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:12,900
We should.

431
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,700
That's where I think both of you add really tremendous unique value.

432
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,700
And so why don't we start with the famous Nimitz case of 2004,

433
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,700
this amazing FLIR video, thermal video, caught in November of 2004.

434
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,300
You have eyewitnesses, David Fravor, who you mentioned,

435
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:36,200
who is really, I think, a source of belief for a lot of people, kind of proxy belief,

436
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,000
because he's a very serious sounding guy.

437
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,200
I mean, you heard him on Rogan, and I think he was tasked with defending LA,

438
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
actually, around 9-11.

439
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
I don't know if you're familiar with that.

440
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,000
I didn't know that.

441
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,400
Because it was like unclear how many planes were, how big the threat was.

442
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,300
And you can hear him speak, and he seems very sort of matter of fact.

443
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,100
But Mick's done a great sort of debunk on this.

444
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,700
So why don't we watch the video and we'll get both of your assessments.

445
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,000
But before we do that, why don't we do a little rock-paper-scissors to see who will go first?

446
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm also happy to take it and just kick it off.

447
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You want Mick to take it?

448
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,300
No, no, he's trying to psych me out.

449
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,000
Look here, let's do a little rock-paper-scissors.

450
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,700
That's right.

451
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,200
All right.

452
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,800
I knew it.

453
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,700
I'm too honest for my own good.

454
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,400
Wait, wait, I don't even see who won that.

455
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:27,400
So just for the audience, before we went live here, Mick said we agreed to rock-paper-scissors.

456
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,800
Mick said he's going to go with paper, and I went with scissors.

457
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,100
So here we are.

458
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,700
Here we are.

459
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,200
All right.

460
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,500
Well, Merrick, you take the first one.

461
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,900
Yeah, but seriously, please jump in if I misstate anything.

462
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:44,000
So the background is in November of 2004.

463
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,600
The Nimitz carrier strike group, so it's the Nimitz and other vessels, Navy ships,

464
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,700
are out for pre-deployment workups, pre-deployment training, basically,

465
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:58,800
to make sure their equipment is working before they deploy and go to combat.

466
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,900
I think they're setting out for Iraq.

467
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,700
So this is early stages of the Iraq War.

468
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,800
Very high operational tempo during their training missions.

469
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,500
The USS Princeton is a guided missile cruiser,

470
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,400
and it is part of this Nimitz strike group.

471
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,800
And it is, over the course of, I think, a week, according to one of the witnesses,

472
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,600
the key witness, Kevin Day.

473
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Maybe 10 days, I think.

474
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,400
10 days, sure.

475
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,300
OK.

476
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:33,800
They begin tracking anomalous objects at 28,000 feet, heading south at 100 knots.

477
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,100
Very strange tracks.

478
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,600
That's odd.

479
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,900
Occasionally, if I understand right, they're tracking them coming from above 80,000 feet,

480
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:48,300
zipping down to the surface of the ocean, or they'd hover around 28,000 feet.

481
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,700
Notably, Kevin Day has been very specific about this and consistent.

482
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,000
28,000 feet, 100 knots south.

483
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,100
And Kevin Day oversaw radar operations.

484
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,600
Correct.

485
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,100
Kevin Day's story has actually changed a few times, and he's given different figures.

486
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,100
28,000 feet, 80,000 feet, and 20,000 feet.

487
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:10,100
He mixes things up, and it's changed in other ways as well.

488
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,300
I've only seen 28,000 feet in all the interviews I've seen.

489
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,100
I think he wrote it down, and he kind of memorialized it in a book.

490
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,100
He wrote a little novella.

491
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,400
I did find this interesting.

492
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,600
They wrote this, like, you would need a novella.

493
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,900
It clearly stuck with a lot of these people, right?

494
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,900
So we digress.

495
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:32,900
And one day, so Kevin Day is concerned that this is flight safety.

496
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,900
It is, right?

497
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,900
I mean, you have objects.

498
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:39,900
I mean, you sanitize your airspace, and you want to know what's out there.

499
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,900
So when your air crew are out there, that they're not going to have potential collision risk.

500
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:52,900
So one day, he vector sends out two F-18 Hornets.

501
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,900
Commander Fravor is flying one of them.

502
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,900
We have not heard from his backseater publicly yet.

503
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:05,900
The other plane, Fravor's wingman, wingwoman, was Commander Alex.

504
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
She's pretty new to the squadron at this point.

505
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,900
She's probably a lieutenant.

506
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,900
Alex Dietrich.

507
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,900
Alex Dietrich, correct.

508
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,900
And her backseat is Jim Slate.

509
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,900
Sorry, Wiseau is the weapon systems officer.

510
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,900
That's the backseater that does kind of a lot of the tactical systems.

511
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,900
And they get out to this.

512
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:32,900
They call a merge so that they're basically in the same airspace as where one of these tracks is.

513
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:43,900
Look out and see an object doing basically kind of like a weird ping-ponging, zigzagging pattern apparently right over the ocean.

514
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,900
And there's this roiling water underneath.

515
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
Very strange.

516
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,900
And so they have these two jets.

517
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,900
If I understand correctly, Fravor departs.

518
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,900
Dietrich stays up high and starts circling.

519
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,900
And they both start circling.

520
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,900
And Fravor's going lower and lower.

521
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:07,900
And as he goes down, the jet, according to Fravor, kind of reacts to him coming down.

522
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,900
And it kind of does, Fravor does a boop noise.

523
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
I don't know if you guys have seen that.

524
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,900
But somebody did a pretty good compilation of his reenactment.

525
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:23,900
And then it kind of shoots off at just unbelievable speeds, according to the witnesses.

526
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,900
Anything else?

527
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,900
Well, a couple other interesting things.

528
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,900
So it goes, you know, it's 80,000 feet and then, you know, right above the surface of the water.

529
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,900
And then he says it goes back up 80,000 feet.

530
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,900
And then he goes 80,000 feet is space.

531
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
So that was like this interesting line.

532
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,900
He also says when he sees the craft, and this is what I found very interesting.

533
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,900
He was like, it almost seemed like it knew that he saw it.

534
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,900
Yeah, and he recognized him or something.

535
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,900
There was some kind of awareness.

536
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
Yeah, that's right.

537
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,900
No, I'm sorry. Good point.

538
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,900
Yeah.

539
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,900
Now that you mentioned it kind of.

540
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,900
So as Fravor's going down the circle, the thing does one of these like kind of a counter circle.

541
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,900
Right.

542
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
And I think it's called a two flight.

543
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:12,900
But it shoots off and apparently ends up at a predesignated rendezvous point.

544
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,900
Let's call it a cap point.

545
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,900
And that is an area known to aircrew.

546
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,900
So that is interesting.

547
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,900
Yeah, this is interesting.

548
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,900
A lot of this information kind of comes second hand by various people.

549
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,900
They were talking about the 80,000 feet.

550
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,900
And you said Fravor said that Fravor didn't see that himself.

551
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
And he didn't even get a blip on the radar.

552
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,900
They didn't actually see it on their own plane's radar.

553
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:43,900
And when they arrived at this location, they didn't at first see anything.

554
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:49,900
And the jets are hauling along at 600 miles per hour, which means that you're not just hovering over one spot waiting for something to appear.

555
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,900
You end up a few miles down the road very, very quickly.

556
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,900
So Commander Dietrich or Alex Dietrich disputes that very clearly.

557
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,900
She disputed that to you, as you know.

558
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,900
And Fravor has said that that log is third hand.

559
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,900
It's just inaccurate.

560
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:11,900
They both said that they arrived at 20,000 feet and there was nothing at 20,000 feet.

561
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,900
So they both said that when they heard merge plot, they looked out and they saw it.

562
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,900
You're suggesting that there's no link between the radar.

563
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,900
They dispute that. I'm just trying to be clear.

564
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,900
And she disputed that to you, as you know.

565
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,900
Right.

566
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,900
I think Fravor himself has actually said that when they arrived, they had to look around a little while before they saw it.

567
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,900
I think they was pretty quick.

568
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Dietrich, well, of course, like Dietrich's account.

569
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
Let's just leave it at there's a discrepancy.

570
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,900
Well, no, there's a big discrepancy.

571
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:47,900
If you're saying that Dietrich's account matches Fravor's account, you have to say that also Dietrich says her experience only lasted five, sorry, eight to 10 seconds.

572
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,900
The entire thing from merge plot to the thing flying away.

573
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,900
Right.

574
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,900
And Commander Fravor says it lasted about five minutes.

575
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:59,900
And he said that all four pilots had eyes on for five minutes.

576
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,900
So using one person's account, we don't really know which one was the more accurate.

577
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,900
I would think probably Fravor because it's a more experienced pilot.

578
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,900
But he himself said that it did take a little while to find the object.

579
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,900
And Dietrich has addressed this and we can go down this rabbit hole.

580
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,900
But she's just said like as a number two, like she's watching him.

581
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,900
She's not watching the target.

582
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
She's watching him.

583
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,900
Yeah, but she said from merge plot.

584
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,900
Okay.

585
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,900
On Twitter.

586
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,900
Which she asked very specifically as it was from merge plot to when the thing shot away.

587
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,900
Fair enough.

588
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,900
I'm acknowledging that there's a dispute there and that's fine.

589
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
That's all right.

590
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,900
Big discrepancy.

591
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:40,900
Well, one other thing I think to discuss is just this idea that this was caught by many sensors.

592
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:46,900
So all we have and all we can go off of on a first principles analysis,

593
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,900
semi distrustful of government in a lot of cases, is this FLIR video.

594
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,900
And we're going to play that in post-production.

595
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,900
We can also watch it here if it's useful to both of you.

596
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:01,900
But they say that they caught it on phased array radar and then you also have eyewitnesses as well.

597
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,900
And so can we even use that as data or what do you guys think?

598
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,900
Go ahead.

599
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,900
Yeah, I think it's a bit of an issue.

600
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:14,900
I think some of the stuff like it dropping from 80,000 feet was something that Kevin Day said that someone else told him

601
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,900
the people who work in the kind of the missile defense program on shore told him that they saw it later.

602
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,900
He didn't actually see that at the time.

603
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:27,900
He says like, you know, it's 28,000 feet, but they went in at 20,000 feet and it wasn't there either.

604
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,900
So there's a lot of in the actual verbal accounts, there's a lot of variation.

605
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,900
I think we can get an overall sense that something happened.

606
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:41,900
There was something that was showed up on the radar and they did see some object, but there is there is quite a bit of variation.

607
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
Was it a seagull, Mick?

608
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
Because I've seen a video of you suggesting it might have been a seagull.

609
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
I don't think it was a seagull.

610
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,900
OK.

611
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:53,900
I suggested that when Fravor was looking down, there might have been a variety of things that he might have seen looking down, like white caps and boats and things and seagulls.

612
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
I think he said one of the things I said.

613
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,900
I think he said, I hate to say this, but there would have been seagulls out there.

614
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,900
Yeah, there would have been.

615
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,900
Yeah, but a hundred miles offshore?

616
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,900
Yeah.

617
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,900
I actually looked this up.

618
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,900
Seagulls really don't go.

619
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,900
I'm not an ornithologist.

620
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,900
Let's be clear.

621
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,900
They don't venture very far from shore.

622
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,900
The seagull thing is quite entertaining.

623
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,900
I don't think it was a seagull.

624
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,900
You got to go down there.

625
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,900
It's kind of interesting, that little little segue.

626
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,900
We were talking about Heineck earlier.

627
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,900
Yeah.

628
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,900
Heineck was the person who came up with the swamp gas thing.

629
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,900
Correct.

630
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,900
Yeah.

631
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
Correct.

632
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
And then later admitted that he was lying and covering things up.

633
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
I think he was lying about that particular case.

634
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,900
I think then he actually thought that might have been a reasonable explanation because

635
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,900
there was a marsh in the middle of where they were looking across.

636
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:42,900
But it was a pretty silly explanation and it was kind of rightly ridiculed by the press.

637
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:49,900
Then it was seized upon by kind of UFO fans to label any explanation of UFOs as being

638
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,900
like, you know, it's just, they just say it's swamp gas or they just say it's a weather

639
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,900
balloon.

640
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,900
And I think to a degree, the seagull explanation has become like the modern swamp gas.

641
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,900
So I get seagull comments almost every day.

642
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,900
Okay, got it.

643
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,900
Almost every day on Twitter.

644
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,900
So you're saying you would admit that seagull is not your base case?

645
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
No.

646
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:13,900
I mean, what Fravor saw was some kind of tic-tac shaped object.

647
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Yeah.

648
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,900
And it appeared to be moving around.

649
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,900
And if it was a seagull, I don't think he would have made that mistake.

650
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,900
Let's talk about a guilt-free alternative to alcohol that's perfect for your dry January

651
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,900
or any time you want to unwind.

652
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,900
Cornbread's Organic CBD Gummies.

653
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,900
These gummies are an absolute lifesaver for my evening routine.

654
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,900
They're a natural way to relax, celebrate or wind down without the hangover.

655
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,900
I've cut back a lot on my alcohol consumption over the last few years.

656
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,900
For a lot of you trying out dry January or cutting back generally, it's not always easy.

657
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,900
But swapping that glass of wine for cornbread CBD gummies is a total game changer.

658
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,900
It's a simple upgrade to your evening routine that leaves you feeling great the next day

659
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,900
without sacrificing the fun.

660
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,900
Plus, with all natural ingredients, they're the perfect way to stay balanced.

661
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,900
Cornbread hemp isn't just a product.

662
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,900
It's a small way to bring balance into your life.

663
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,900
Whether you're journaling, meditating or simply enjoying some downtime,

664
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,900
these gummies elevate the experience without any of the guilt.

665
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,900
It's like having a moment of calm in your pocket, ready whenever you need it.

666
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,900
Alcohol doesn't have to be the default anymore.

667
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,900
Whether you're cutting back for dry January or just looking for a healthier way to relax,

668
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,900
you've got to try cornbread CBD gummies.

669
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,900
Right now, American Alchemy listeners can save 30% on their first order.

670
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,900
Just head to cornbreadhemp.com slash Jesse and use code Jesse at checkout.

671
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,900
Again, that's cornbreadhemp.com slash Jesse, code Jesse.

672
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,900
Cornbread hemp, this is the good life.

673
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,900
And then how many eyewitnesses do we have?

674
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,900
That's a great, yeah.

675
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,900
We have a few, right?

676
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,900
Can I just quickly back up maybe?

677
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,900
And gosh, I mean, the setup has taken so long.

678
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,900
We're not even going to look at the video.

679
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,900
But there's another, there's a, I believe a squadron commander from a Marine Corps squadron

680
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,900
that was actually flying by.

681
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,900
Kurth, I think is his name.

682
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,900
Kurth, Kurth, Kurth, whatever.

683
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,900
And he, they decided not to vector him out there.

684
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,900
I think because of fuel issues, I'm not sure.

685
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,900
But he saw the roiling whitewater.

686
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,900
He didn't see the tic-tac, but the roiling whitewater.

687
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,900
That's interesting, right?

688
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,900
But to your point, for that first encounter, we're talking about eight eyeballs on this thing.

689
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,900
One of them is squadron commander, the others are pretty well trained.

690
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,900
Right, right.

691
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,900
And what do you think about that?

692
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,900
Yeah, I wish that we'd get more witnesses coming forward.

693
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,900
I think it's difficult now because it's literally 20 years since this happened.

694
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:44,900
And memory face and Alex Dietrich herself has said that she doesn't really remember the details that well now.

695
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,900
And probably the other people won't either.

696
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:53,900
But I think once you've got past the initial year or so of people remembering things,

697
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,900
it's very difficult to get that much more good information.

698
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,900
And using accounts from the time, if available, is usually the best way.

699
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,900
But we don't really have those.

700
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,900
Alex does say she has some notes that she made and some diagrams.

701
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,900
How do we get those?

702
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,900
Well, you give her a call.

703
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
That's right.

704
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,900
Yeah, reach out.

705
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,900
Well, there are a couple of other interesting things.

706
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,900
I think there were two radar systems, the SPY-1B radar and the APS-145 radar.

707
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,900
And we've seen neither of those.

708
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,900
We just have the FLIR geostorm.

709
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,900
And this is recorded after.

710
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:32,900
This is like an hour or two after the video, which I think that's when you had the E2 Hawkeye and then the Princeton.

711
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,900
So just to back up, the E2 is like a flying radar, basically, right?

712
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:43,900
And it apparently had a weak hit on this target, what's in the video.

713
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,900
And the Princeton did as well, which is how.

714
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,900
And Underwood had it on his radar, too, he said.

715
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
That's right.

716
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,900
Yeah, he said he got a hit on his radar.

717
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,900
He had three radar systems on whatever that is.

718
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,900
Indeed.

719
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,900
And this is Chad Underwood.

720
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,900
Correct.

721
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,900
Sorry.

722
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,900
Yeah.

723
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:05,900
So that original aircrew, the four aircrew and those two jets go back to the carrier.

724
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,900
They get out.

725
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,900
Apparently, Fravor tells Underwood, hey, we just saw something weird.

726
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,900
Try to go catch it.

727
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
And Underwood's really gung-ho about it, apparently.

728
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,900
And yeah, I'm going to go get it.

729
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,900
And yeah, he's vectored out.

730
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,900
I'm guessing like an hour or two after.

731
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,900
It's not clear.

732
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,900
They don't say.

733
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,900
Okay.

734
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,900
So they cycle through.

735
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,900
People about it.

736
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,900
I think I asked Kevin about it and he didn't want to tell me.

737
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Yeah.

738
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,900
But they cycle through.

739
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,900
Underwood gets out and he gets these hits on the E2.

740
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,900
Was the E2 on the first encounter or was it on the second one?

741
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,900
And I just don't remember.

742
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,900
I'm not sure.

743
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,900
I think there were some eyewitness accounts from the E2.

744
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,900
People said they saw it out the window, but I don't think they'd actually really come

745
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,900
forward to swear on it.

746
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:58,900
The other possible interesting piece of information, which I'll just speculate on and that we probably

747
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,900
get to the bottom of, is you have this interesting nuclear connection with past UFO sightings.

748
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,900
This seems to be some possibly repeatable thread.

749
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,900
You have a great book called UFOs and Nukes by a guy named Robert Hastings, which I always

750
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,900
tell you.

751
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,900
I was reading it on the way here.

752
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,900
I appreciate that.

753
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,900
Excellent book.

754
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:21,900
And so what's interesting about the Nimitz carrier strike group is there were likely

755
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,900
tactical nukes on board.

756
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:31,900
Yeah, just when it comes to ships like that.

757
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,900
I can say with certainty that I think the Nimitz is a nuclear power carrier.

758
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,900
I don't know about the weapons and that's out of my expectations.

759
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:45,900
It's both nuclear powered and then most of those hold tactical nukes is my understanding.

760
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,900
That's about my pick right there.

761
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,900
You got me there.

762
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,900
My source there is Robert Hastings.

763
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,900
I'm a big Robert Hastings fan.

764
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,900
Well, yeah, you would say that's biased.

765
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,900
You would say that's pretty good.

766
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,900
I think Hastings is a tangent.

767
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,900
We can get into this later.

768
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,900
But I think Hastings is pretty solid.

769
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,900
He is, yeah, go for it.

770
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,900
I'm mixed bag, I was saying, I think.

771
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,900
Listening to his book, he does a pretty good job of doing a lot of research.

772
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,900
He's very detailed.

773
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:23,900
It does seem very much biased towards trying to prove that point.

774
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,900
And he'll lay out a few things.

775
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
Well, it could be this, it could be that.

776
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,900
But I think he's actually aliens.

777
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:34,900
On the theory side, but on the kind of what happens side, he's like pretty empirically rigorous.

778
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,900
Yeah, he's repeating things.

779
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,900
It's mostly eyewitness accounts.

780
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Well, I got to give him credit.

781
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:45,900
I mean, he's compiled and I take an intelligence analysis approach to this topic much

782
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,900
more than Mick takes a much more technical approach.

783
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:54,900
But the documentation that Robert Hastings has secured is unbelievable.

784
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,900
I mean, it's extraordinary.

785
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,900
It's 170 eyewitnesses.

786
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,900
It's incredible.

787
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,900
And also the government documents, right?

788
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,900
That to me is also of interest.

789
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,900
Anyway, that's a whole other recipe.

790
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,900
It's a whole other apple, but I think it's important for establishing some sort of priors on this stuff.

791
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:18,900
Because just to kind of out myself here, I want to be as much of kind of a non-factor

792
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,900
and just honest judge and let you guys have at it.

793
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:27,900
But my own kind of way I process this is I usually think these things are prosaic or explainable.

794
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:34,900
Explainable way, they're air trash or balloons or whatever, or exotic craft.

795
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:40,900
But I think in the case of nuclear, that might be the exception.

796
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,900
Just because I think you have this repeatable, they say science needs to be repeatable.

797
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,900
And you do have this really interesting repeatable thread where you have all these witnesses

798
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,900
who have cue clearances.

799
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,900
It's hurt their careers to come out there.

800
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,900
Incentives are not to come out.

801
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,900
And if 170 have come out in the form of this book and you have a researcher who's now in his 70s,

802
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,900
how many more are out there?

803
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,900
That would be my question.

804
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,900
Well, to your point, we wouldn't know about these videos if they hadn't been leaked.

805
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,900
Right.

806
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,900
To your point.

807
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,900
This is interesting, too, because let's talk about the provenance of Nimitz.

808
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:19,900
Because Nimitz, Gimbal, and GoFast were popularized in this New York Times article in 2017.

809
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,900
But Nimitz, I believe, the video itself was kind of floating around on Reddit.

810
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,900
And it was even on a German server or something.

811
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,900
It was on a German server.

812
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,900
And you can still access it via the archive.org, the Waybank machine.

813
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,900
So there's actually a live link to this from, I think, I'm not sure exactly where in 2010.

814
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,900
So what German server?

815
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,900
This is...

816
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,900
It's like a CGI.

817
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,900
People digging into this.

818
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,900
And I quickly just make a point here.

819
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,900
This is when debunking goes wrong.

820
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:49,900
Because when that came out and it was on Above Top Secret, all these message boards or whatever,

821
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,900
people had decided, oh, that's a hoax.

822
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,900
That's not real.

823
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,900
And then Mick, I love this.

824
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:07,900
So in December of 2017, I think, To The Stars Academy put out an interview with,

825
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,900
I think it's Commander Alex Dietrich.

826
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,900
And your quote here on Metabunk on December 30th is...

827
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:20,900
And she kind of described the whole encounter and described everything that we just discussed.

828
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,900
And your quote here is, frankly, it's laughable that anyone is taking this seriously.

829
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:26,900
Right?

830
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,900
I'd have to save a bit more context about what I'm saying.

831
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,900
No, it's Metabunk post 84, December 30th, 2017.

832
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,900
Post 84?

833
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,900
What do you mean by that?

834
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,900
But on a particular thread, on the FLIR1 thread.

835
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,900
So I just want to be...

836
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:45,900
Debunking can really go wrong because this is arguably the most perplexing case.

837
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,900
I assume this video was real from the start, as I recall.

838
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,900
I'm not accusing you of...

839
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,900
So I mean, taking it seriously must have been like taking it seriously that this was something

840
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,900
performing amazing maneuvers, which is something I wanted to bring up.

841
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,900
With all these videos, there's really two questions that we better ask.

842
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,900
The first one is, is this object on the screen doing anything amazing?

843
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:09,900
Is it demonstrating unique physics that we don't understand or advanced technology?

844
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,900
And then after you have answered that question or addressed that question,

845
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,900
the other question is, what actually is it?

846
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,900
What might it be?

847
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,900
Do you have a base case assumption?

848
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,900
Because it doesn't seem to be flying normally.

849
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,900
Well, my base assumption for...

850
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,900
Well, my base determination for these three videos is that they don't demonstrate

851
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,900
anything amazingly anomalous.

852
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,900
And so with FLIR specifically, so like Seagull is not the base case.

853
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,900
Do you have any other sort of explanations or you're just like not anomalous?

854
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,900
As Murray knows, I think it's some kind of distant aircraft that is not moving,

855
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,900
not moving laterally.

856
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,900
When these videos first came out, there were people talking about how amazing they were.

857
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,900
FLIR 1 in particular was deemed to be amazing because the object appears to zip off screen.

858
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,900
And there's parts of the video where it seems to accelerate very rapidly

859
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,900
and then it loses track at the end.

860
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,900
And that's one of the first videos that I analyzed.

861
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,900
And I kind of went through it frame by frame.

862
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,900
And I think I showed fairly conclusively that all those things are just camera movement.

863
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:21,900
And you really think David Fravor saw just a normal aircraft?

864
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,900
No, I don't think so.

865
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:23,900
Okay.

866
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,900
No, these are two separate things.

867
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,900
Fravor and Dietrich had an encounter with a little tic-tac of some sort.

868
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,900
And then this video was taken out later.

869
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,900
It may be the same thing, but I think it's probably a different thing.

870
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,900
Despite the fact that these sightings had gone on in this little week-long stretch in November,

871
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,900
you think they're just different?

872
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,900
The sightings, they hadn't.

873
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,900
The radar returns had.

874
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,900
The radar returns, yes.

875
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,900
We had weeks of radar returns.

876
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,900
And then they went out for intercept on November 14.

877
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:48,900
Yeah.

878
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,900
And then apparently it stopped.

879
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:50,900
That was it after that.

880
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,900
That's what Kevin Day said after that encounter.

881
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:53,900
They didn't.

882
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,900
Nothing ever happened afterwards.

883
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:04,900
But yeah, the video itself, I don't think shows any like a balanced physics or anything

884
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,900
like that.

885
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,900
We don't know exactly what it is.

886
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,900
I think it's some type of distant aircraft that's flying away.

887
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:16,900
But as Merrick will explain later, there are issues with determining what type of aircraft

888
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,900
it is because of the angles of the image and things like that.

889
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,900
Merrick, if you just had the video and you didn't have the eyewitness accounts, is there

890
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,900
anything that would lead you to believe that this is anomalous?

891
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,900
That's interesting.

892
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,900
Without the eyewitness accounts, I probably would have...

893
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,900
That's a really good question.

894
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,900
Old me would have just dismissed it.

895
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:47,900
The me who's engaged with Mick, who has studied this topic, would be much more interested

896
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,900
absent the eyewitness accounts.

897
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:54,900
But maybe with the promise of other sensors that pick this up but that are too sensitive

898
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,900
to release or something.

899
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:56,900
Yeah.

900
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,900
It is weird.

901
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,900
Yeah.

902
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,900
It's odd, obviously.

903
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,900
Sorry.

904
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,900
In removing the context, it is odd on its face, on its face.

905
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:10,900
And I'll just to counter Mick or just to maybe respond, I'm very much on the opposite end

906
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,900
of the spectrum.

907
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,900
I'm glad we started with this case because ruling out a plane is probably the easiest

908
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,900
thing we can do today.

909
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,900
It is pretty simple to tool out of.

910
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,900
That's fine.

911
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,900
Yeah.

912
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:25,900
But so look, I mean, it is fascinating.

913
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:31,900
I have, based on the analysis that, and it's not just me, but the analysis that some of

914
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:36,900
my colleagues and one of them, as you know, is a University of California scientist, brings

915
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,900
superb expertise to the table.

916
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,900
And I would say, I'll speak for myself, but I have fairly high confidence that that was

917
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,900
a tic-tac-shaped craft and we can go through the data as we...

918
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,900
And then to kind of flip it on you, Mick, if the video didn't exist and you couldn't

919
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:57,900
easily straw man it with a debunk and you just had like these super credible pilots,

920
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:04,900
like eight plus, all saying, you know, we've seen this anomalous thing, would that lend

921
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,900
all of this more credence?

922
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:12,900
I think the detrick and Fravor encounter sounds by itself as being a really interesting event.

923
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,900
And it's Fravor's account of it that convinces people.

924
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:21,900
It's what convinced you with this Joe Rogan thing and a lot of people on the Hill have

925
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,900
talked to Fravor and heard his account and they've been convinced by it.

926
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,900
So this video isn't what's convincing people.

927
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,900
It's the eyewitness accounts that do it.

928
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,900
Having this video as well kind of lends some credence to those eyewitness accounts.

929
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,900
It says like, we saw an object and here's a video of an object.

930
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:43,900
It doesn't really look like the same object, but it's extra evidence that something was there.

931
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:48,900
And the more witnesses you have, the more likely something is to have actually happened.

932
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,900
So, Mick, can I just quickly say this video is not convincing to folks on its own.

933
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,900
And I think my job here today is to make it convincing and thank you for giving me the

934
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,900
opportunity because I think we have some compelling data to show.

935
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,900
Absolutely, yeah.

936
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,900
Well, the final other thing that I'll say about this case, which I find interesting,

937
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:10,900
is I think a new Raytheon FLIR system had just been installed before detection.

938
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,900
And Raytheon, I think, came out with a statement because they were like,

939
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,900
what's going on with our FLIR system?

940
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,900
This is kind of crazy.

941
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,900
And Raytheon was like, we're not responsible for what you detect with our system,

942
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,900
which I found very interesting as well.

943
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,900
Yeah, I think they just upgraded the system, upgraded the software perhaps.

944
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,900
OK, OK, software.

945
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,900
I mean, this wasn't known publicly, right?

946
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,900
Nobody knew about this until, I mean, 2007, people didn't know about it.

947
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:42,900
I think it was 2015 when Fravor started talking on fighter pilot podcasts and stuff.

948
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,900
And it really didn't bubble up until 1516.

949
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,900
The German server thing is fascinating.

950
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,900
Yeah, it's super bizarre because it was like a graphic design shop or something.

951
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,900
I think it was CGI or something like that.

952
00:50:53,900 --> 00:51:00,900
When I hear that, my mind goes to they were trying to see if you could possibly recreate it.

953
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,900
Yeah, I think what happened there was that it was just basically a site where you could upload stuff,

954
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,900
like an open FTP server.

955
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,900
Back in the day, you would use that for uploading stuff.

956
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,900
And they just dropped it there.

957
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,900
Who dropped it there?

958
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,900
The person who leaked it.

959
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:22,900
So it was just a leak, but on a German, so it was like a place you would leak a video like that?

960
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,900
The US military doesn't have the original.

961
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,900
The one that they released is the same.

962
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,900
It's the one that they got from the German FTP server.

963
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,900
And then they released it.

964
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,900
That's fascinating.

965
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,900
Well, they just re-record over the tapes.

966
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,900
Can they now release the original?

967
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,900
They probably don't have it.

968
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,900
They don't have it.

969
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,900
They don't have it.

970
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,900
I strongly doubt it.

971
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:41,900
There's a wrinkle there.

972
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,900
There are allegations from some of the sailors aboard the Princeton, I think,

973
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:53,900
that people in suits landed in helicopters and took all the radar data.

974
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,900
I don't know what to make of that.

975
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,900
Who says that?

976
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,900
Is it Voorhees?

977
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,900
Gary Voorhees.

978
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,900
Gary Voorhees?

979
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,900
I think he's mentioned that.

980
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,900
And there are a couple others that have said it.

981
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:04,900
Okay.

982
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,900
Sean K. Hiller.

983
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,900
I apologize.

984
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,900
I just don't know.

985
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,900
I know Fravor.

986
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,900
P.J. Hughes, I think.

987
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,900
P.J. Hughes.

988
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,900
Yeah.

989
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,900
They're into me both of them.

990
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,900
Fravor's been skeptical of that publicly.

991
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,900
I don't know what to make of that.

992
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:21,900
So just to the point of data retention, it has a spooky immaculate constellation level.

993
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:22,900
Yeah.

994
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,900
Because that's what the allegation of immaculate constellation is.

995
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,900
That all this stuff is siphoned off.

996
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,900
Yeah.

997
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,900
I don't know what to make of that.

998
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,900
That's another good example of how the stories vary quite a lot.

999
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:35,900
You've got all these enlisted men on the boat who have this story about how the Databricks

1000
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,900
were stolen and then Fravor just didn't happen.

1001
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,900
Exactly.

1002
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,900
It's difficult to reconcile.

1003
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,900
Correct.

1004
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,900
Yeah.

1005
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:44,900
But obviously maybe Fravor didn't know.

1006
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,900
Who knows?

1007
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,900
Who knows?

1008
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,900
Very interesting.

1009
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,900
Should we dive into the...

1010
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,900
Yeah.

1011
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,900
We can watch the video.

1012
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,900
Yeah.

1013
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,900
I think you guys both see this?

1014
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,900
Yeah.

1015
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,900
Cool.

1016
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,900
We're familiar.

1017
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,900
This is the start here.

1018
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,900
So it's in infrared mode.

1019
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,900
And let's explain.

1020
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:05,900
So thermal imaging, what is this white dot in the middle mean?

1021
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,900
Well, it's not actually a white dot.

1022
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,900
It's actually kind of a spiky shape at the start, which is interesting.

1023
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,900
It's a good valid point.

1024
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,900
Then it switches to TV mode.

1025
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:17,900
And TV mode means it's basically a video camera, black and white video camera.

1026
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,900
And we see it's black here.

1027
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,900
Now, I originally thought it was black.

1028
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,900
It looks almost exactly like the Chilean case, but of course it's TV mode.

1029
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:31,900
So this is actually what you would theoretically see with your own eyes.

1030
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,900
Then it switches back to infrared.

1031
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,900
You can see the object kind of moved around a little bit.

1032
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:38,900
A little spin there.

1033
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,900
Now, that's the camera doing a gimbal roll.

1034
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,900
The camera has to readjust itself occasionally.

1035
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,900
There's another little roll there.

1036
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,900
Yeah.

1037
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,900
Well, it's going to do some interesting stuff in a second.

1038
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:51,900
Yeah.

1039
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,900
That's kind of the one boring part, I guess.

1040
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,900
OK.

1041
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,900
So it looked there like it zoomed off screen.

1042
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,900
And then this is the end thing where it appears to zoom off to the left-hand side.

1043
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,900
So yeah, the symbology, we got like a whole bunch of stuff, numbers on the screen.

1044
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,900
And then it switches back to TV mode.

1045
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,900
And then it switches back to TV mode.

1046
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,900
So yeah, the symbology, we got like a whole bunch of stuff, numbers on the screen.

1047
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,900
And this is how we kind of get to do the analysis.

1048
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,900
We have the angles.

1049
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,900
We have the top of the screen.

1050
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,900
We have the heading, the azimuth.

1051
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:29,900
And then we've got the elevation, which is like six degrees here.

1052
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,900
I can't remember.

1053
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,900
You mean from right to left?

1054
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,900
No, the elevation.

1055
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,900
I think it's five up.

1056
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,900
It's six up, and then five.

1057
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:35,900
Yeah, it's six, then five.

1058
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,900
Yeah, exactly.

1059
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,900
So that gives us kind of a line of sight.

1060
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,900
So we know that it's somewhere along this line of sight.

1061
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:46,900
And this line of sight moves from right to left fairly levelly.

1062
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,900
And so we can kind of correlate that with the other numbers on the screen,

1063
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:56,900
which is the airspeed of the jet, which is expressed in calibrated airspeed.

1064
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,900
You have to convert it to true airspeed.

1065
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,900
And then the altitude.

1066
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,900
We know the altitude of the plane from that.

1067
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,900
So you can use all that to kind of set up a model of what we're looking at

1068
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,900
and what's actually happening.

1069
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,900
That's kind of like almost like the second part of the analysis.

1070
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,900
The first part is actually, is it doing anything amazing?

1071
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:19,900
And we saw at the end of the video, it kind of zooms off to the left of the screen.

1072
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:20,900
And there's kind of two parts to that.

1073
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,900
There's one where it kind of, well, first of all, it kind of drifts a little bit,

1074
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,900
and then it seems to shoot off very rapidly.

1075
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,900
And people initially thought that that was it accelerating very rapidly.

1076
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:32,900
But it's actually just changing zoom levels kind of halfway through the movement.

1077
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,900
If you kind of undo that zoom back from two times to one time,

1078
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,900
it just basically smoothly goes off.

1079
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,900
And the analysis I did on there using all the angles and everything

1080
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,900
was that the drift that it moved off from left to right

1081
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,900
was exactly the same as the drift that the camera was moving at.

1082
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,900
So I think what we're actually looking at here is the camera was tracking something like this,

1083
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:57,900
and then the camera lost lock, and the object just kept going at exactly the same speed.

1084
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,900
So it gives the same effects of the object zooming off to the side,

1085
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,900
but it isn't actually moving.

1086
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:09,900
Mick, are you familiar with Yannick's analysis that it actually drifts off,

1087
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:15,900
it moves off four times faster at the very end than it does during the other losses of lock?

1088
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,900
Are you familiar with that?

1089
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,900
No, I wouldn't be surprised because it's only a partial loss of lock.

1090
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,900
In the other ones, it's still basically kind of tracking it.

1091
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:31,900
I don't think when you see it losing lock, it's not really lost the lock at those points.

1092
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,900
Can I just say, we're getting so in the weeds,

1093
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:40,900
and I just want to say maybe for the audience that part of the reason that I'm doing this

1094
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,900
is I want to engage more people.

1095
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:47,900
I want more people mathematically, scientifically inclined folks to grapple with this stuff.

1096
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,900
That's why I write these articles.

1097
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,900
I'm trying to encourage interest, spur interest.

1098
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,900
I 100% agree.

1099
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,900
We should teach this in colleges because it's a fun analysis exercise that people can get their teeth into.

1100
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,900
Sorry for that PSA, but I really just want to convey that.

1101
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,900
That's probably the whole problem here between you and I is it's just you and me.

1102
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,900
Right. Exactly.

1103
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,900
And there's other people.

1104
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:15,900
There's no reason why other people can't analyze these videos.

1105
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,900
Exactly.

1106
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,900
But it does take a long time, though.

1107
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,900
It does.

1108
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,900
It is quite a lot of work.

1109
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,900
This is years of work that we've put into these videos.

1110
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,900
On my side.

1111
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,900
So I got to give them credit.

1112
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,900
And they would say that the loss of lock just wouldn't account for that sort of zinniah.

1113
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,900
It's ambiguous.

1114
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,900
Chad Underwood, who's the whizzo, who filmed it, he said,

1115
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,900
nope, there's no way the system would have lost it.

1116
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,900
I've talked to an active duty whizzo serving now.

1117
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,900
And he said, it's a finicky.

1118
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,900
I sent you the emails, right?

1119
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,900
You remember this?

1120
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,900
And I made a point.

1121
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,900
But the system can be finicky and can lose a lock.

1122
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,900
So it's a wash.

1123
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,900
I don't know what to make of that.

1124
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,900
Is the FLIR auto-tracking or is there somebody operating that?

1125
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,900
That is auto-tracking.

1126
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,900
So yeah, that is correct.

1127
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,900
It's a pixel, exactly.

1128
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,900
Yeah, it's using basically the contrast between pixels.

1129
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,900
It's just like image tracking in After Effects.

1130
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,900
You just lock onto something and it follows it.

1131
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,900
Got it.

1132
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:09,900
It doesn't do a very good job.

1133
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,900
It's kind of interesting comparing the technology in 2004 with the later things in Gimbal and GoFast,

1134
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,900
which the lock seems a lot more solid.

1135
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,900
What I like about this is I feel like both of you are being very reasonable.

1136
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,900
And if anything, I'm more confused in a healthy way.

1137
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:28,900
You know, really, I mean, in my mind, the assessment there might be like the net assessment,

1138
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,900
quote unquote, would be like, you know, really interesting eyewitness accounts

1139
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,900
and then kind of inconclusive on the video front.

1140
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,900
We'll just wait until we get to the analysis.

1141
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,900
OK, cool.

1142
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,900
Yeah, yeah.

1143
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,900
That heated discussion between Hal Puthoff and Eric Weinstein on remote viewing.

1144
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,900
Yeah, you heard that right.

1145
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,900
I still can't believe I experienced that firsthand.

1146
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:02,900

00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,900
All right, should we move to GoFast?

1160
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,900
Can we go to the slideshow real quick?

1161
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,900
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.

1162
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:06,900
I really want to show you what Road and Mick, you know, this is the video that you still have up

1163
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,900
and I got a bone to pick with you, right?

1164
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,900
This video is still up and it's clearly not an airline.

1165
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,900
Let's describe what we're talking about for a second.

1166
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:21,900
So Mick has several videos up looking at the FLIR 1 video and one of them,

1167
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,900
he hypothesizes that it's a distant airliner.

1168
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,900
I think you said on a podcast that it's probably 50 to 100 miles away.

1169
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,900
Yeah, I think this video I made is like, do you remember when it was?

1170
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,900
Like 2019 or something like that?

1171
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,900
Yeah, I just think it's still up there and I think that's misinformation from my perspective.

1172
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,900
I have added the description of the video.

1173
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,900
You put one sentence on there, nobody's going to read that one sentence.

1174
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,900
I think it's very misleading to have that video still up there.

1175
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:52,900
If you said it's an airliner 100 miles away, that thing's at 66,000 feet.

1176
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:53,900
That's impossible.

1177
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,900
Originally I hadn't done this analysis, very much analysis.

1178
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,900
It was pretty early on in the discussion thread.

1179
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,900
And so I was saying like what it might look like.

1180
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:07,900
And I picked a airliner because that's what I'm kind of used to from this Chilean case.

1181
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:11,900
I was still kind of maybe biased by that Chilean case.

1182
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,900
And I kind of did a little side-by-side comparison and they look somewhat similar.

1183
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,900
You can kind of see they look somewhat similar, not the same.

1184
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,900
Will you remove that video because it's clearly...

1185
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:25,900
No, I think the basic analysis is right and I can maybe change the title of it.

1186
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,900
The analysis isn't that this is what it is.

1187
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:31,900
It's that a blurry shape can look like another blurry shape.

1188
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:36,900
You clearly say in the video like, oh, it looks kind of like an airliner going off to the right.

1189
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,900
It does kind of look like one, but it isn't.

1190
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:39,900
Yeah, but it can't be.

1191
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,900
So why wouldn't you...

1192
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,900
Yeah.

1193
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,900
The analysis of the video is still valid, but it kind of looks like that.

1194
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:47,900
You know it's not.

1195
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:48,900
Maybe you understand my point, right?

1196
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,900
I think it's misleading.

1197
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:50,900
I think it's misleading to keep it up.

1198
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,900
I've added that to the description of the video.

1199
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,900
Okay, let's move on.

1200
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,900
So this is why it's so easy to rule out a plane.

1201
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:58,900
Number one, there's no tail.

1202
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,900
Boom, simple.

1203
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,900
Number two, if you're looking five degrees up, right?

1204
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,900
The perspective is if...

1205
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,900
Mick's theory is that it's another plane.

1206
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,900
He uses another F-18 in his example.

1207
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,900
I'm trying to do this for the camera.

1208
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:18,900
If you're looking five degrees up, the jet will have kind of like a downward slope like this.

1209
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,900
Clearly, the object is tilted up this way, and there's no plane.

1210
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,900
You can change the plane type.

1211
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:24,900
There's no plane that'll fly like...

1212
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,900
What do you have this distant plane going?

1213
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,900
Like 250 knots?

1214
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,900
300.

1215
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:35,900
No plane is going to fly at like a 13, 15, 20 degree angle of attack at 300 knots.

1216
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:36,900
It's just not reasonable.

1217
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,900
There's no tail.

1218
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,900
Ruling out a plane is the easiest thing we'll do all day today from my perspective.

1219
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:42,900
Yeah, I think you can though.

1220
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,900
I think the problem with this video is that it's a super low resolution video.

1221
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:46,900
But the angle is really...

1222
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,900
It's crystal clear.

1223
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:48,900
It's not really.

1224
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:52,900
You will talk later about how the angle of the sun is going to affect the way you're

1225
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,900
looking at things, and we don't know exactly what we're looking at here.

1226
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,900
We're looking at a dark shape.

1227
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,900
Maybe some parts of that are being illuminated by the sun.

1228
01:02:58,900 --> 01:02:59,900
Or the tail.

1229
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,900
Maybe that's a similar color to the sky.

1230
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,900
Lots of planes have different...

1231
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:05,900
No, no, no.

1232
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,900
This works by contrast.

1233
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,900
Contrast, right?

1234
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,900
Contrast in the optical spectrum.

1235
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:11,900
It has a white tail.

1236
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,900
Planes cannot have white tails.

1237
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,900
This is black against the sky.

1238
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:21,900
You're saying that it's a white tic-tac shape, an actual tic-tac shape.

1239
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:22,900
Yeah, absolutely it is.

1240
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,900
And you're saying that it's got this funny weird shape.

1241
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:26,900
Yeah, we addressed that.

1242
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:27,900
Because of the lighting.

1243
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,900
So it's not a plane, from my perspective.

1244
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:30,900
It's easily...

1245
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:37,900
If it could be a tic-tac shape that somehow morphed into this bizarre peanut shape because

1246
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:42,900
of the sunlight and these little legs that are supposedly sticking out, then why couldn't

1247
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,900
it be a different type of plane?

1248
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:45,900
Perhaps not this FA-18.

1249
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,900
There's a whole bunch of different types of planes.

1250
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:48,900
What plane flies at this angle?

1251
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,900
I don't think you're just flying at that angle.

1252
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,900
So your eyes are just seeing me like it's really not at that angle?

1253
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:54,900
No.

1254
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,900
I think what we're looking at isn't representative of the actual shape of the object.

1255
01:03:58,900 --> 01:03:59,900
Great.

1256
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,900
So anybody who can see...

1257
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,900
Okay, it's pretty clear that it's tilted up.

1258
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:04,900
Why wouldn't it be representative?

1259
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,900
You mean it's pretty clear that it's tilted up?

1260
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,900
You can see with your own eyes.

1261
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,900
It's got a pointy bit at one end.

1262
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:11,900
And we'll get to that.

1263
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:17,900
So if it's tilted up, then it's got a pointy bit at one end, that means it's not really

1264
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,900
a tic-tac shape, isn't it?

1265
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,900
Well, that is an artifact that your software...

1266
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,900
And this is why you make...

1267
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:24,900
You've been so helpful.

1268
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:25,900
I've shown you this.

1269
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,900
You can recreate that effect with your software with a tic-tac.

1270
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,900
You could probably recreate it with a different plane as well.

1271
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:31,900
It's something I haven't done.

1272
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,900
You're a big evidence guy.

1273
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:35,900
Try.

1274
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:38,900
Why can't you find me something with no tail?

1275
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:44,900
I feel it's kind of a fool's errand because there is not enough evidence in that video

1276
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:45,900
to determine...

1277
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,900
Look at it.

1278
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,900
It's this blurry blob.

1279
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,900
The video is probably out of focus.

1280
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,900
You see the attitude, the tilt.

1281
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,900
And if you watch the whole video, you can see that tilt.

1282
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:58,900
It's crystal clear.

1283
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,900
You see it turning as well, which is something that goes kind of weird.

1284
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:05,900
It doesn't really work, I think, with the tic-tac model in the simulator.

1285
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:06,900
Do you want to just go to the next image?

1286
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:11,900
Because this is super interesting, and I owe credit to, I think, somebody on...

1287
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:17,900
I think his name was Paul, but he did very simple edits, brilliance and contrast.

1288
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,900
And there's no trickery here.

1289
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:20,900
It's very simple.

1290
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,900
If you go to the next one, please.

1291
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,900
We did a 3D model.

1292
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:27,900
And this is kind of a Rorschach test, right?

1293
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,900
The UAP is in the eye of the beholder.

1294
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:37,900
And I need to quickly add that both Commander Fravor and Lieutenant Commander Dietrich have

1295
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:43,900
stated that when they reviewed Underwood's tapes afterwards, they saw these little appendages,

1296
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,900
these protrusions.

1297
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,900
Which is impossible.

1298
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,900
I mean, is it Lonnie Zamora?

1299
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,900
That reminds me of a Lonnie Zamora craft, would he describe?

1300
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,900
But we know he's completely out of focus, so you wouldn't be able to see this.

1301
01:05:54,900 --> 01:06:00,900
Lonnie Zamora is a famous craft that came down in 64 and in New Mexico.

1302
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,900
Allegedly had little legs, but anyway.

1303
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:03,900
Allegedly had little legs.

1304
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,900
This image here, I think, is very misleading.

1305
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:09,900
I think it's basically being that you've tweaked the amount of brightness to bring in the edges.

1306
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:13,900
If you do that, you're just sliding the middle slider in the levels adjustment.

1307
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,900
So we can find a tic-tac shape if you just do basic edits.

1308
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,900
You can find the gimbal shape.

1309
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:19,900
What basic edits are we doing?

1310
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,900
Brilliance and contrast.

1311
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:22,900
Brilliance and contrast.

1312
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,900
And what exactly?

1313
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,900
So contrast, I think, is probably pretty obvious.

1314
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,900
Increasing the contrast.

1315
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:29,900
And then brilliance is...

1316
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,900
I think he turned it up.

1317
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:32,900
Again, I didn't do this.

1318
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,900
Anybody can go, that's the beauty of this, and this is why anybody can do this.

1319
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:36,900
The level slider would do that, I think.

1320
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,900
Is brilliance like light saturation or what?

1321
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,900
I'm not sure, actually.

1322
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,900
I'm not an optical effects guy, so I didn't do this.

1323
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,900
No, it's an un-standard term.

1324
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:47,900
It's not like a Photoshop term.

1325
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,900
So what I think is really interesting is, and we can really drill down to,

1326
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:54,900
you see that little kind of that sunlit section on the top?

1327
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,900
Yes.

1328
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:05,900
That, in fact, we can place this object and we can actually find which direction under what is flying,

1329
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:09,900
and we can see where the sun was at around 330, 320-ish, give or take,

1330
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,900
and you can recreate that in a 3D.

1331
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,900
This is the first time I'm really presenting this.

1332
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:14,900
We're very excited.

1333
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,900
We're going to put this in a paper very soon.

1334
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:21,900
But you can actually recreate that effect and see where the sun is.

1335
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,900
And in 3D, you can move the sun around and it gives you that effect.

1336
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:26,900
Interestingly enough...

1337
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:29,900
And that lines up with his position in reality.

1338
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,900
Correct.

1339
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:31,900
So let's go to the next one.

1340
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,900
Mick, you brought up, oh, it's black.

1341
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,900
Well, this is TV mode.

1342
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,900
Those F-18s are not black.

1343
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,900
They're light gray, right?

1344
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,900
That's how the system works.

1345
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:42,900
It's back in the silhouette.

1346
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,900
Yeah, so that's why we have a black shape.

1347
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:49,900
It's something you can't say that is the same because it's the same color.

1348
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,900
It doesn't mean it's a different color either.

1349
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:52,900
We don't know what color it is.

1350
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,900
But you've moved off the plane thesis.

1351
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:55,900
You don't think that?

1352
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,900
I don't think we can rule it out.

1353
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:58,900
But you have to provide...

1354
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,900
Just give us one option.

1355
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:05,900
Just propose one plane that would fly like this.

1356
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:08,900
Well, why don't you propose one type of UFO that could fly like this?

1357
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:09,900
Right there.

1358
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:10,900
A Tic Tac.

1359
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,900
A UFO is just unidentified by nature.

1360
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,900
But what about a model of a Tic Tac UFO?

1361
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,900
It's a sport model, obviously.

1362
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,900
That's impossible for him to answer.

1363
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:24,900
A plane that could flip that profile silhouette with the lysing.

1364
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,900
We just don't know...

1365
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:26,900
I have a couple more.

1366
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:27,900
Do you mind?

1367
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:28,900
Sure.

1368
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:29,900
Yeah, sorry.

1369
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:30,900
Run through this.

1370
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:31,900
So you talked about that peanut.

1371
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:32,900
Yeah, so this is...

1372
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:33,900
I used Mix.

1373
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:34,900
This is Mix.

1374
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,900
Oh, weird.

1375
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,900
Well, just do you know what's going to be?

1376
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:38,900
Just say it.

1377
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:39,900
We'll put it in post-production.

1378
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:46,900
Yeah, so when you actually edit the video to kind of recreate the graininess and the

1379
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:50,900
out-of-focus, you can recreate the Tic Tac shape.

1380
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,900
You can recreate it.

1381
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,900
I mean, it's not a plane, guys.

1382
01:08:54,900 --> 01:09:00,900
It's extraordinary to find a match, like a remarkable match with what eight eyeballs saw

1383
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,900
two hours earlier, you can recreate that.

1384
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:04,900
With Mix software.

1385
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:05,900
With my software, yeah.

1386
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,900
I wish I did.

1387
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,900
No, thank you.

1388
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:08,900
And I did that for you, Merrick.

1389
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:13,900
But isn't that compelling that maybe this is just sensory data, that is?

1390
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:14,900
There's a couple points.

1391
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,900
I'll say one thing.

1392
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:17,900
Thank you, Mick.

1393
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:21,900
We owe the U of Hope World owes you a huge debt of gratitude for the amount of work that

1394
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:22,900
you put into it.

1395
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:23,900
I'm glad you're finally getting paid.

1396
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,900
I don't know who's paying you, but...

1397
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:26,900
Wait, what is...

1398
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,900
Are you going to pay by who?

1399
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,900
Someone I can't name.

1400
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:31,900
Okay.

1401
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:32,900
This is incredible.

1402
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:37,900
And it allows us to test out everybody's theories, not yours, not ours, not anybody's.

1403
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,900
And so thank you for that.

1404
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,900
Just real quick.

1405
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,900
The reason this software exists is actually because of you.

1406
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:45,900
I appreciate it.

1407
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:46,900
And we are...

1408
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,900
So what are the odds?

1409
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:48,900
It's not just this.

1410
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:53,400
The original gimbal simulator, which is the granddaddy of this, was because Merrick was

1411
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:58,900
getting so annoying with this consistent criticism that I had to finally make a good video and

1412
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,900
I had to write all this software to do it.

1413
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,900
And then I wrote this nice long video and...

1414
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:06,900
But Mick, you always say like, oh God, you know, these eyewitness accounts are always

1415
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,900
so incredible, but there's never any data to back them up.

1416
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:14,900
Here's a Tic Tac with little legs, which is exactly what Fravor and D-Trick were called.

1417
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:20,900
The amount of blur that you had to add there to make them match would mean that they wouldn't

1418
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:21,900
be able to see that as well.

1419
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,900
All I'm asking is give me any plane.

1420
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:24,900
SR-71.

1421
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:25,900
Any plane.

1422
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:26,900
YouTube.

1423
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:27,900
I don't care.

1424
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:28,900
Well, how can I make...

1425
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:29,900
I'm mad.

1426
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:30,900
It's a mad.

1427
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:31,900
You made it blurry.

1428
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:32,900
So...

1429
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:37,900
Well, I guess, Mick, what would you say to the fact that you can use some slight edits

1430
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,900
with a program that you built that allows you to...

1431
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,900
This is just to recreate one frame.

1432
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:43,900
I think what would be interesting...

1433
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:44,900
No, it's a video.

1434
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,900
Oh, okay.

1435
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:46,900
Fair enough.

1436
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:47,900
Yeah.

1437
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:50,900
The actual object itself appears to do this kind of weird rotation and get a bit more

1438
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:56,900
pointy at one end, which I kind of interpreted as being like a plane turning, but...

1439
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,900
The pointiness is recreated.

1440
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:01,900
It's an artifact of that front appendage.

1441
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,900
I've sent you the video.

1442
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,900
But we don't have the rotation, the matches.

1443
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:11,900
And your highest percentage likelihood thing is plane still, even though there's some issues.

1444
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:12,900
I don't know.

1445
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:16,900
Like, you know, Marik brings up some good points in Yannick.

1446
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:21,900
So, you know, I think what I would say is you can't 100% rule out a plane.

1447
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:22,900
I feel comfortable doing it.

1448
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:23,900
There's no tail.

1449
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:24,900
And it matches with...

1450
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,900
100% ruling out things is a huge mistake that people have historically made.

1451
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,900
I think of the Chilean case.

1452
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,900
They spent two years ruling things out.

1453
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:35,900
And they were wrong because they ruled out a plane right at the start.

1454
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,900
And then there's this...

1455
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,900
There's no tail.

1456
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,900
You can't see a tail.

1457
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,900
Of course you can.

1458
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:43,900
What about the...

1459
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:48,900
Remember the video that Jesse sent us a few days ago of the tic-tac?

1460
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,900
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1461
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:54,900
And you said that you agree with me that it was a plane.

1462
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:55,900
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1463
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,900
It has no wings.

1464
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,900
And that's a very common thing that people see, like in videos.

1465
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:00,900
So what was that?

1466
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,900
It would have been another plane.

1467
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:02,900
I'm sure it was another plane, yeah.

1468
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,900
Go to the next slide real quick.

1469
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,900
So this is how we were able to place it.

1470
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:09,900
There's a consistent rightward banking.

1471
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,900
You can kind of see it here.

1472
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:13,900
And that's how...

1473
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:14,900
There's a strong...

1474
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,900
And thank goodness Yannick is a climate scientist.

1475
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:18,900
Sorry, buddy.

1476
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,900
I hope I didn't out you.

1477
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,900
But he has access to extremely nuanced weather data.

1478
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,900
And we can find out, if you go to the next slide there,

1479
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:30,900
we can look at the weather data from that time at that altitude.

1480
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:35,900
And there's an extremely strong northerly wind coming from the north,

1481
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,900
about 100, 110 knots.

1482
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,900
And in the video, you see this kind of this consistent rightward banking,

1483
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:45,900
which is the autopilot compensating to maintain a straight heading as it goes.

1484
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,900
And that allows us to place the heading of that plane and see,

1485
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,900
okay, well, now we know where the sun is,

1486
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:55,900
and then we can match the sun with the top of that illuminated section.

1487
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:59,900
The issue with that is that planes don't need to bank to maintain a heading.

1488
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:00,900
Is that true?

1489
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:01,900
Yes.

1490
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:02,900
Okay.

1491
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,900
And then we discussed this.

1492
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,900
So you said that you thought that they did, but...

1493
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:07,900
So yeah.

1494
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:08,900
You sent me a bunch of chat DQT things.

1495
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,900
You're talking about crabbing, right?

1496
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:11,900
No.

1497
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:12,900
No?

1498
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:15,900
Well, I'm talking about the dinner screen, like the true heading,

1499
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,900
the ground heading, and the air heading.

1500
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,900
Right.

1501
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,900
So to maintain a particular ground heading,

1502
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:23,900
you just need to have an air heading that incorporates the wind vector.

1503
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,900
So the autopilot, you can see at the bottom, it says HDG.

1504
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:27,900
That's heading.

1505
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,900
So that means the nose is going to maintain a heading.

1506
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:31,900
Yes.

1507
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:32,900
Ground track is irrelevant.

1508
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:33,900
It's the same thing.

1509
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:34,900
Ground track's irrelevant.

1510
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,900
It only would need to bank if the wind was changing.

1511
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:37,900
No, it needs to stay.

1512
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:40,900
The nose is going to stay at, let's say, 270, right?

1513
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:41,900
Doesn't matter.

1514
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:42,900
Doesn't matter.

1515
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:43,900
So how's it maintaining...

1516
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,900
You point it in the direction you want to go,

1517
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,900
and you go in that direction.

1518
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:52,900
Or you point the velocity of your plane in the direction you want to go,

1519
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,900
which might involve you turning a bit to the side,

1520
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,900
but you don't need to bank to do that.

1521
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,900
If you bank, you'll keep turning.

1522
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,900
But it's consistent, right? It does this.

1523
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:01,900
No, it's just wobbling a little bit.

1524
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:02,900
That was greatly magnified.

1525
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:04,900
That was the thing I sent you years ago.

1526
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,900
And it goes in both directions.

1527
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,900
It goes a little bit more to one side.

1528
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:12,900
It does go, actually, to the other side a little bit.

1529
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:13,900
It doesn't.

1530
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,900
You're fundamentally wrong with the idea that you need to bank

1531
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,900
to turn to the side.

1532
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,900
It's 100-knot winds coming in.

1533
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,900
It doesn't matter. It's completely irrelevant.

1534
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,900
It could be 1,000-knot winds.

1535
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:27,900
So if the wind is pushing the aircraft...

1536
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,900
Planes fly relative to the air.

1537
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:35,900
That altitude of the air is basically just a constant, homogenous mass,

1538
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:39,900
and there's no real turbulence to speak of in terms of differentials

1539
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,900
between the wind directions.

1540
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:45,900
So if the wind is moving like this

1541
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,900
and you want to be flying in that direction,

1542
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,900
you'll just have to turn a little bit into the wind.

1543
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:51,900
That's called crabbing.

1544
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:55,900
No, that's called changing the heading of your plane.

1545
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:59,900
Crabbing is something where you actually slide the plane a little bit.

1546
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,900
You're using rudder, exactly.

1547
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:02,900
We're not talking about that.

1548
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,900
No, we're not talking about that.

1549
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:08,900
Your velocity relative to the air is just straight through the air.

1550
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:09,900
Okay, let's move on.

1551
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,900
We're going to get in the weeds.

1552
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:15,900
We can cut that out or whatever.

1553
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,900
No, leave it in.

1554
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,900
But would a plane need to bank in this scenario?

1555
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,900
There's a consistent rightward banking,

1556
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:25,900
which our hypothesis is because of the 110-knot winds.

1557
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,900
So real quick, last point on this.

1558
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:28,900
You might just go on up one more.

1559
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:29,900
Sure.

1560
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,900
Sorry, just one higher.

1561
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,900
Sorry, the other way.

1562
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,900
Last but not least, we can actually –

1563
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:40,900
so Kevin Day said that these objects were at 28,000 feet.

1564
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,900
I'd be curious to see if he has said other,

1565
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:46,900
but everything that I've seen is he's said that 28,000 feet heading south at 100 knots,

1566
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,900
we can find that in the data.

1567
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:55,900
We can find the Chad Underwood object moving south at 100 knots at 28,000 feet,

1568
01:15:55,900 --> 01:16:00,900
descending slowly, but we can find that as a very, very anomalous flight path.

1569
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:04,900
So again, we can find very, very specific descriptions

1570
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:08,900
of what the witnesses recall in the data.

1571
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,900
That is critical, and we see that with Gimbal as well.

1572
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,900
Do you not find that compelling?

1573
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,900
You can find all kinds of things in the data,

1574
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,900
depending on what parameters you put into it.

1575
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,900
And this is at the distance roughly that Underwood gave.

1576
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,900
That's important, right?

1577
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:25,900
You can find basically a straight-line path as well of the object moving away,

1578
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:29,900
consistent with it being a plane or some similar type of aircraft.

1579
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,900
And if you change things around, change the way the wind direction is,

1580
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,900
then you can find different things.

1581
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:39,900
If you change the distance, you can find different things again.

1582
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:43,900
I don't think this is the only solution here.

1583
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:47,900
No, but it is remarkable to find that in the data.

1584
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,900
It doesn't happen by accident.

1585
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,900
That of course suggests that what we're looking at is actually a balloon.

1586
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:54,900
That is absolutely a possibility, yes.

1587
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:57,900
And a balloon would explain the radar targets possibly,

1588
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,900
because they're moving with the wind.

1589
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,900
We have this wind, as you described earlier, moving from north to south.

1590
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:05,900
I think balloon is a far more reasonable explanation than plane.

1591
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,900
I wouldn't rule it out.

1592
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:11,900
I think, like I said before, my analysis of these videos is kind of two parts.

1593
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,900
Is it doing anything amazing?

1594
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,900
And what is it?

1595
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,900
And I don't think it's doing anything amazing.

1596
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,900
I don't think drifting south at 100 knots is doing something amazing.

1597
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:23,900
It is very weird. At 20, what, 20,000 feet?

1598
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,900
What do you know that does that, that is that size?

1599
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,900
A balloon?

1600
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,900
That's that size?

1601
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,900
Why would a balloon be that far off the coast?

1602
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:35,900
I don't know. It could be some kind of military balloon.

1603
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,900
Then you're going to have to...

1604
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,900
This is 20 years ago now, literally.

1605
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,900
What kind of proposal?

1606
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,900
You can throw spaghetti right against the wall.

1607
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,900
This is a debunking playbook.

1608
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,900
But provide some options. What could it be?

1609
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,900
I think we should move on.

1610
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,900
Let's do it.

1611
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,900
This is great. I love it. This is awesome.

1612
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:57,900
I think there are a lot of open questions we just presented that the audience should go out and investigate.

1613
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,900
Please, by all means.

1614
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:05,900
I don't rule out these options, but I don't think you should also ride a plane.

1615
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:19,900
Let's get into the GoFast video, which was recorded in January of 2015, 300 miles off the coast of Jacksonville, the USS Roosevelt.

1616
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,900
Merrick, you set up the last one.

1617
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,900
Why don't you set up this one, Mick?

1618
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,900
This is a fun one.

1619
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:29,900
This appears to be something that's moving very fast over the surface of the water.

1620
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:33,900
It's similar to the FLIR 1 video in that it's thermal footage.

1621
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,900
This is all thermal. There's no TV mode.

1622
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:41,900
I think they do switch between black hot and white hot, but what we're looking at here is the surface of the ocean.

1623
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:49,900
We see this object, and the object appears to be colder than the surface of the ocean, which is very unusual for a powered craft.

1624
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:53,900
We have a variety of numbers on the screen.

1625
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,900
We have the angle down, minus 23 at that point, is it?

1626
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,900
29, again, I need my glasses.

1627
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:03,900
And then we have the heading, which is off the top of the screen.

1628
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,900
We actually do have that.

1629
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,900
And then we have a range value.

1630
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:15,900
Now, unlike in the FLIR 1 video, when they lock onto this object, they actually do get a range number.

1631
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:21,900
There's some dispute as to actually where that number comes from, like how far away is this object?

1632
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:25,900
We don't know if it came from a radar hit or if it was some other way of doing it.

1633
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,900
So we're not entirely sure how accurate it is.

1634
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:35,900
But if you assume that that number there is relatively accurate, you can do a reconstruction of this object.

1635
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:39,900
And it turns out to be going a lot slower than initial estimates.

1636
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:43,900
Like initial estimates predict, I think, somewhere in our 600 knots.

1637
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,900
Max six point something or other.

1638
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,900
And it turns out to be going much, much slower.

1639
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,900
So definitely under 100 knots.

1640
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:56,900
Some disputers are exactly how fast it's going.

1641
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:00,900
I've done some reconstructions where it's about 60 knots.

1642
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:03,900
Yannick just pointed out one where he's done where it's more like 90 knots.

1643
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,900
And he said that's also consistent with the wind speed.

1644
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:14,900
So my hypothesis about this one is that it's probably just a wind blown object like a balloon.

1645
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:21,900
If we do some analysis as to the size of the object, we can determine it's not particularly big.

1646
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,900
It's about three to six feet in diameter.

1647
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:30,900
So something just like a weather balloon seems like a reasonable explanation for me, especially as it doesn't really do anything amazing.

1648
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:35,900
And this one's really interesting because Arrow just came to the All Domain Anomalous Resolution Office.

1649
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,900
We're talking about its director.

1650
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,900
It came out and they said that this is possibly parallax.

1651
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:46,900
And so they're saying that there are probably certain things in the sky that we can't classify.

1652
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,900
But they are kind of coming out against this video in particular.

1653
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:55,900
This video is also interesting because you have audio associated with the video.

1654
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:57,900
And the guy goes, whoa, got it.

1655
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,900
We just interviewed Navy fighter pilot Ryan Graves.

1656
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,900
He testified before Congress, also under oath.

1657
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,900
And he kind of admitted it was a buddy of his who he thinks is kind of beyond the approach.

1658
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,900
They're very close friends. I mean, they're super close.

1659
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:12,900
Close friends. So yeah, what's your response to Mick here?

1660
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:25,900
I think we would – I'm very confident that we would not had Arrow come out with this assessment at the recent hearing if they had actually talked to the air crew.

1661
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:29,900
And I have a major bone to pick with Arrow. They didn't talk to the air crew about this.

1662
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:30,900
Why wouldn't they talk to the air crew?

1663
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:36,900
I don't know. And it fits in with the blue book, the debunking playbook of never talk to witnesses.

1664
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,900
Just throw something out there.

1665
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:46,900
I don't know if this is part of the old guard, the previous director who I think has rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.

1666
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:51,900
Rubbed me. I had a long discussion with him. Rubbed me the wrong way.

1667
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,900
So I think that's a massive oversight.

1668
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:59,900
It is an analytic failure for them not to talk to the air crew because clearly those guys were excited by something.

1669
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:07,900
There's a reason – you don't just lock up some little random object in the middle of 300 miles off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida.

1670
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:10,900
Oh, by the way, this is 10 minutes before the gimbal video.

1671
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:19,900
Oh, by the way, this is amid daily observations or sensor observations of spherical objects off the East Coast that are,

1672
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:23,900
as Ryan told you and has been very public about, were A, a safety of flight concern and B,

1673
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:27,900
were operating in very anomalous ways per their systems.

1674
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:32,900
They're locking them up on FLIR on their training, their infrared training missiles on their radar.

1675
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:37,900
You have multiple three, four sensors. Their eyeballs are seeing them sometimes, occasionally.

1676
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:40,900
So it is a massive analytic oversight.

1677
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:47,900
I have a major bone to pick with Aero about that because Ryan just came out on your show

1678
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:52,900
and in your discussion said that this was part of – and I think you said it previously,

1679
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:58,900
but shocker, this was part of – this was one of four objects that were in a line of breast formation, right?

1680
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:01,900
So they're kind of like cruising along next to each other.

1681
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:04,900
That's not – weather balloons don't do that, obviously.

1682
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:09,900
So I don't think we would be having a very different discussion if Aero had actually done their job.

1683
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:13,900
And this is – it's right above the surface of the water, right?

1684
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,900
No, no. I actually – I think –

1685
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:16,900
It is or it's not?

1686
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:17,900
No, it's not.

1687
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:20,900
So the aircrew did not name this GOFAST. I don't know who named it.

1688
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:28,900
So I think Ryan has said – Lieutenant Graves has said all the Pentagon did is debunk the name,

1689
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:32,900
which the Pentagon – I think the Pentagon itself gave the video.

1690
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:37,900
So I – look, there's a – I want to just be very clear.

1691
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:41,900
There's a reason – you don't just – this is like a tiny needle in a haystack.

1692
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:46,900
You don't just find something just slurring – slewing your targeting pod around to the ocean.

1693
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:50,900
They had a – there was a radar hit that gave them some kind of an indication that there's something there.

1694
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:58,900
And by the sounds of their voice, what they were seeing visually did not match up with the radar, the data they were getting.

1695
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:00,900
That's really a reach, I think, trying to –

1696
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:05,900
Look at it fly. What's it doing, right? Whatever they said. They're very surprised by it.

1697
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:09,900
I think they were surprised that they caught it on their – they're at FLIRT.

1698
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,900
What's it look at it fly is the actual word.

1699
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:13,900
Yeah, well, it looks like it's going very fast.

1700
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:17,900
Well, I don't think they're stumped by parallax. They might have been, but the bottom line is –

1701
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:21,900
You'd be surprised. I mean, the pilots are stumped by parallax all the time.

1702
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,900
Bottom line is – okay.

1703
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:25,900
Can you describe what parallax is to the audience?

1704
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:31,900
Yeah, parallax is just when your viewpoint changes, things that are closer to you appear to move faster.

1705
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:38,900
So if you're looking at the wall over there and you're looking at my thumb and you move your head, my thumb appears to move that way.

1706
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:46,900
And you think that multiple eyewitnesses saw parallax, even though the gimbal video was recorded like minutes after this?

1707
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:49,900
No, the GoFast thing isn't multiple eyewitnesses seeing things.

1708
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:54,900
It's these people, these two guys in a plane, seeing this thing probably just on their screens.

1709
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:57,900
And so all they're seeing is this display.

1710
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:01,900
The field of view here is about – it's less than one degree.

1711
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:02,900
It's tiny.

1712
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:06,900
Which is a really, really powerful zoom lens. It's like the biggest zoom lens you could get.

1713
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:11,900
It's equivalent, I think, of over 2,000 millimeters SLR.

1714
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,900
And this is in an F18 Super?

1715
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,900
Correct. Correct. Yeah, two seater.

1716
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:22,900
Yeah, I just mean eyewitnesses. They're actively looking. It's not on a screen like the Nimitz thing.

1717
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,900
That's what I mean, not eyewitnesses in that they're seeing the object.

1718
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,900
People did look at the video afterwards.

1719
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:30,900
Ryan Graves said he was distracted looking at the gimbal video.

1720
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,900
At least I'm sure he must have seen this one as well.

1721
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,900
It's really interesting that we have all these witnesses coming forward now.

1722
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:40,900
It's a shame that they didn't come forward years ago because this is new information.

1723
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:46,900
Absolutely. And we might be hearing more from, as Ryan said on your show – and sorry, Ryan, if you're watching.

1724
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:49,900
I think he's annoyed at me because he paid me.

1725
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,900
When's your buddy coming out? When are they going to come out and talk?

1726
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,900
I would love that. More information is great for everyone.

1727
01:25:54,900 --> 01:26:00,900
Absolutely, because it's the same guy who recorded the gimbal video, which is the poster child of this whole –

1728
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:04,900
Well, that guy needs to come out. I'll do an interview with you.

1729
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:15,900
Guy wherever you are. But again, I cannot stress enough. I'd love to hear him expound or kind of expand, rather, on the formation.

1730
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:22,900
I mean, your point here is that you don't think he's doing anything amazing in this video, but you think there's something amazing about the situation.

1731
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:24,900
If it's flying in formation, absolutely, absolutely.

1732
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:26,900
When this video doesn't show that.

1733
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:30,900
Well, we've got this kind of second-hand 10 years later, a years later thing from Ryan.

1734
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:36,900
Can I just say one thing, to your point? Yes, he might actually be doing something. Yannick, put this in all caps.

1735
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:43,900
Assuming the range is exact, the best visual match – and this is a scientist, folks. Not me.

1736
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:51,900
The best visual match in mixed simulation has the object around 100 knots. Not 60 knots, as Mick claims. End quote.

1737
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:57,900
Yes. That's assuming it's accurate, which is, as we discussed earlier, it's a very dubious thing.

1738
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:01,900
And was it not moving against the wind, or was that just the gamble?

1739
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:02,900
Plus the gamble.

1740
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:11,900
Well, we don't know that. Because if the aviator who recorded it comes out and says, oh, yeah, we were freaked out because it was moving against the wind.

1741
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,900
Well, that would be great, but that hasn't happened yet.

1742
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:18,900
I'm just saying that's why we really need to hear from him. But I really want to hear about the formation.

1743
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:24,900
And if there's any way he remembers what direction, maybe that's why they're so surprised.

1744
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:30,900
Wow, that tiny thing is moving against the wind. We don't know. Bottom line is Aero dropped the ball, in my opinion.

1745
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:36,900
Yeah, well, we need more. We need these guys to come out. And they need at least a behind-the-scenes interview.

1746
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:45,900
I'm going to put on my ex-government hat here. Aero kind of put themselves in a really tough spot, because they came out and did this.

1747
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:52,900
Now you're going to have an aircrew come out and contradict you. That's a terrible position for a government agency to be in, potentially.

1748
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,900
Well, he already did, right? I mean, through Ryan.

1749
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:58,900
Where do they contradict him? I mean, all they said was that it appears to be going slow.

1750
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:04,900
I'll tell you exactly why. Because it says the Aero conclusion, it does no anomalous maneuver.

1751
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:05,900
All right.

1752
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,900
It doesn't do any anomalous maneuvers in this video.

1753
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,900
If it's holding formation, that is anomalous maneuver.

1754
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:20,900
Well, no. Four objects blowing in the wind will stay in the same formation for 300 miles off the coast?

1755
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:23,900
Well, then they're in formation at that point.

1756
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:27,900
Balloons are going to stay in a perfect, or we don't know if it's perfect.

1757
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:31,900
We don't know exactly what the formation was. Or was it a perfect straight line?

1758
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,900
We've got to hear more, bottom line.

1759
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:35,900
I agree.

1760
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:36,900
Track him down, Jesse.

1761
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:37,900
I'll do my best.

1762
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:41,900
Yeah, I'm going to have Ryan right after this and say we should do something.

1763
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:53,900
And again, the context is so critical. Ten minutes before Gimbal, ten minutes before the most anomalous, or at least strange video that a lot of people have seen.

1764
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,900
Was that very kind, the time that it was before?

1765
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:57,900
Yeah, you can see the timestamp on the bottom.

1766
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:02,900
That kind of wraps around, I think. It doesn't show the hour.

1767
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,900
I'm pretty confident it was right before.

1768
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:05,900
So it could be an hour.

1769
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:10,900
Yeah, it doesn't really matter that much, but I'm just wondering if there was some verbal confirmation from a witness.

1770
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:14,900
Should we watch it? Anything else on GoFast before we go to Gimbal?

1771
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:20,900
No, I don't think there's much there that we discussed.

1772
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,900
Okay. Yeah, we can play it in post.

1773
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:32,900
Guys, Arrow, your job is to investigate UFO videos and data, and this is one of three of the most recognizable videos. How do you not talk to the aircrew?

1774
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,900
Arrow should release their analysis.

1775
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:39,900
Do you agree that it's kind of egregious that Arrow did not interview the aircrew?

1776
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:43,900
I don't see why they wouldn't have done. It's a data point.

1777
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:47,900
I mean, they even got the year wrong in the slide. It said January 16.

1778
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:48,900
That's weird.

1779
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:59,900
I mean, I have a major bone to pick with the analytics side of Arrow, because we all know that they have really done a poor job on a lot of their reports, so I don't need to belabor that.

1780
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:03,900
I'm optimistic that the new director will change things around.

1781
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:09,900
I think you and I both know that Arrow have said some things that are incorrect.

1782
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:14,900
Kirk Patrick, basically, it was astounding, and I don't need to get into it.

1783
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:18,900
He's said various things in public as well, which didn't really tie with reality.

1784
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,900
Yeah, that's a very diplomatic way of putting it.

1785
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:26,900
At the NASA hearing, he said some speckles on the screen were stars, but they were obviously not stars.

1786
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:27,900
Weird.

1787
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,900
I think he phoned it in. I think he was close to retirement. I don't know.

1788
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:37,900
I think he's more there as a person who's standing on the organization rather than being an analyst himself, so he wasn't that familiar with everything.

1789
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:42,900
And to his credit, he did stand up, so I'm grateful for the first time that he talked to me.

1790
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:43,900
And they solved a lot of cases.

1791
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:53,900
Do you guys ever wonder if any of these things are sort of Rorschach tests or initiation paths for your analytical rigor abilities or whatever?

1792
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:59,900
And so some of these videos are halfway truths, and it's like our job to somehow solve it, and then you solve it.

1793
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:00,900
You get in the program or something.

1794
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:05,900
I hope not, because the taxpayers need to get their money back. This is pretty awful.

1795
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:09,900
It's a waste of time in a nuclear multipolar world that's heating up.

1796
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:12,900
It's kind of a, why are you playing puzzle games with the American people?

1797
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:13,900
Yeah, exactly. Right.

1798
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:16,900
Well, they're doing it because of that legislation.

1799
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:25,900
Well, I do want to say it's interesting that just on the TikTok video, so my buddy Chris Ramsey, amazing magician, has a channel called Area52.

1800
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:30,900
But he's actually kind of good when it comes to this stuff, because Area52 is around the UFO thing.

1801
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:35,900
He actually believes in a lot of the UFO stuff. As a magician, he debunks other magicians.

1802
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:36,900
Yeah, that's great.

1803
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:40,900
So he's kind of like a good person to throw at this whole topic.

1804
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:46,900
He was flying a commercial flight over Nellis testing range, and he saw that TikTok that I showed you guys.

1805
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:51,900
You both said probably prosaically explained. I'll play the video.

1806
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,900
But why prosaically explained?

1807
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:57,900
Because it is interesting in the context of de-fraversing a TikTok, too.

1808
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:02,900
It's a super common sighting before they would describe them as being cigar shaped.

1809
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,900
And what it is, it's just planes.

1810
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:07,900
The fuselage of the plane is eliminated by the sun.

1811
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:13,900
But the wings are either a different color, if you're looking from above, like the gray wings, you're seeing the plane of the gray wings,

1812
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:17,900
or they're not being eliminated by the sun because the sun's above them and you're below them.

1813
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:22,900
So you will see basically just the fuselage of the plane, the bright white thing.

1814
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:26,900
And at that distance, you just can't make out the wings.

1815
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:29,900
And when you take a video of it, it doesn't show up on the video.

1816
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:35,900
And we've seen this numerous times with tracks I've seen myself flying down to LA once.

1817
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:40,900
And you can just get the location and find which of the planes were in the area

1818
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:45,900
and just drop it in to Sitrec by my software and you can see what it actually was.

1819
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:48,900
Gotcha. Well, yeah, no, that's good to hear.

1820
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:55,900
I mean, the way in which that didn't comport at all with the Fravor eyewitness account is it wasn't going right next to the water, shooting off,

1821
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:58,900
exhibiting all these anomalous flight characters just sort of floating.

1822
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:04,900
We never see these amazing maneuvers unambiguously on video.

1823
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:07,900
Either it's this fuzzy dot in the distance.

1824
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:09,900
You certainly do in Gimbal. You see it very anomalous and it's fantastic.

1825
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:10,900
Well, it's dissipatable.

1826
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:18,900
And then how put off, rebuttal to what you just said, Mick, is especially when it comes to optical sensors like just cameras,

1827
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:24,900
you get these kind of blue shift, red shift effects where you're stretching light.

1828
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:28,900
If you're kind of moving away or kind of crunching it, if you're moving close, you get these kind of ultraviolet.

1829
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,900
It doesn't make any sense, though.

1830
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,900
It's an excuse for why we can't get these things on video.

1831
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:35,900
But people see these things and they have these eyewitness accounts of them.

1832
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:39,900
It's not like your eyes are somehow physically different to a camera.

1833
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:44,900
They're little photoreceptors in the back and there's a lens in the front and it works basically exactly the same way.

1834
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:49,900
It's just a chemical, electrochemical reaction rather than a sensor array.

1835
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:55,900
I mean, that's somewhat of a biochemical reductionist view of the way we see things.

1836
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:57,900
Do you think that consciousness is important?

1837
01:33:57,900 --> 01:34:00,900
Well, the way we see things is extraordinarily consistent with the way cameras see things.

1838
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:03,900
If you take your camera and take a picture of this, you're going to see pretty much the same thing.

1839
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:07,900
It's not like we're magically conjuring up things in this room in our brains.

1840
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:12,900
There's a physical reality that we can see and the same physical reality as what camera state pictures are.

1841
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:17,900
And so if UFOs exist in physical reality and we can see them, then we can also take pictures of them.

1842
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:18,900
Yeah, I think that's fair.

1843
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:23,900
I think you'd have to get into kind of trippy philosophical discussions around, you know,

1844
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:30,900
widening the doors of perception or can kind of glitch into like other realities and we don't need to go there.

1845
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,900
Basically magic at that point.

1846
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:37,900
Oh, magic or a different theory of mind, which you could get into.

1847
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:43,900
I mean, that a lot of pretty well-respected philosophers and people like Aldous Huxley, William James,

1848
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:48,900
and there's even modern neuroscientists would possibly agree with.

1849
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:52,900
You have Donald Hoffman talking about the brain as sort of an interface.

1850
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,900
But anyways, we don't need to get into that.

1851
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:56,900
So let's get into that.

1852
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,900
Can I say one more quick thing on GoFast?

1853
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,900
Because it does appear spherical, right?

1854
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,900
Like if it's a balloon.

1855
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:03,900
It's very hard to say.

1856
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,900
It's about six pixels across.

1857
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:06,900
And I already mentioned this.

1858
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,900
This is amid daily encounters.

1859
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:17,900
But the sphere is that one morphology, that shape that keeps propping up just over and over in the historical record,

1860
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:22,900
starting with 80 years ago with the Foo Fighters and you have metallic, I'm going to quote, right?

1861
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:24,900
There's a whole bunch of stories.

1862
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:31,900
In 1944, Newsweek ran the silver sphere puzzle on Christmas Day in 1944.

1863
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:36,900
Associated Press, balls of silver seen over the German Reich, intrigue science, right?

1864
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,900
So there is a consistency.

1865
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:44,900
If you read Captain Ed Ruppelt, he's the first director of Blue Book, his book,

1866
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:51,900
The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects in 1956 is a remarkable read, and that is just, it is staggering.

1867
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:54,900
And that really got me down the rabbit hole.

1868
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:57,900
He mentions just over and over these sightings of these metallic spheres,

1869
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:00,900
silver spheres, metallic spheres, flying in formation, V-shaped formations.

1870
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,900
We'll see that in Gimbal.

1871
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:03,900
We'll talk about that.

1872
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,900
It's a shame we don't have more photos of metallic spheres.

1873
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:06,900
It is extremely interesting.

1874
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:10,900
Eisenhower was aware of the Foo Fighters issue from 42 to 45.

1875
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:19,900
You had around or possibly over 200 fighter pilot witnesses when it came to allied fighter pilots seeing these things.

1876
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:21,900
You had some that were kind of prominent.

1877
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:28,900
Ted Stevens, who later became a senator in Alaska and co-sponsored UFO research with Harry Reid through OSAP,

1878
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:31,900
saw a Foo Fighter.

1879
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:33,900
OSAP is why we're having this whole discussion.

1880
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:34,900
There's a chain.

1881
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:35,900
You can draw a direct link.

1882
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:38,900
OSAP to ATIP to Lou Lozano to New York Times.

1883
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,900
That's why we're having this conversation.

1884
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:41,900
So it's fascinating.

1885
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:42,900
I'll quickly wrap up.

1886
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:45,900
Kirk Patrick, former director of Aero, said, quote,

1887
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:50,900
we're seeing metallic orbs, direct quote, making very interesting apparent maneuvers all over the world.

1888
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:51,900
That's interesting.

1889
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:54,900
Nobody in the NASA panel, by the way, raised their hand when he said that.

1890
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:55,900
These are scientists.

1891
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:56,900
Why didn't every hand go up?

1892
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:57,900
Excuse me.

1893
01:36:57,900 --> 01:36:58,900
Did you clarify a little bit?

1894
01:36:58,900 --> 01:36:59,900
Right.

1895
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:00,900
Nobody asked a question.

1896
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:04,900
The chair of the panel was texting on his phone as he was saying that.

1897
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:06,900
It's pretty astounding.

1898
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:10,900
Top gun pilot Jack Stewart came out a couple maybe a year ago.

1899
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:13,900
I think Ryan mentioned this on your discussion.

1900
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:17,900
But he's flying along and notices something whizzed by his canopy.

1901
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:18,900
He kind of thought it was a balloon.

1902
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:19,900
OK.

1903
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,900
His wingman saw it, right?

1904
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:25,900
He's flying, I guess, somewhere in a position to see his tail.

1905
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:29,900
And he said, yeah, dude, that thing turned around and followed you.

1906
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:31,900
It goes on.

1907
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:38,900
Donald Trump has said, I've had Air Force pilots, very good guy, better than Tom Cruise,

1908
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:45,900
come out and say, we've had spherical objects, circular objects out fly our F-22s.

1909
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:48,900
That's one of the most advanced aircraft in our arsenal.

1910
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:53,900
This consistency in the Korean War, you see this reporting in these old documents.

1911
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:56,900
There are good reasons for this consistency.

1912
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:57,900
How do you explain that?

1913
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,900
I think there's two reasons why you would see spheres a lot.

1914
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,900
One is that there's balloons out there.

1915
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:05,900
And the other one is that a lot of people are just seeing very small things that are far away.

1916
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:10,900
And they interpret that as a point of light as a sphere because they're asked what shape it is.

1917
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:15,900
That's one of the kind of almost like a mistake that people make in UFO reporting is that they ask what the shape is

1918
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:19,900
and they give them a list of things to do and they don't say, you know, it's a tiny dot that we couldn't say.

1919
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:20,900
But the balloon thing is interesting.

1920
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:22,900
Like you mentioned the German things.

1921
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:24,900
Weather balloons get a bad rap.

1922
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:30,900
But Germany at that time was actually using metallic silver balloons as sighting balloons,

1923
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:33,900
which was an old fashioned way of determining the wind speed at altitude.

1924
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:41,900
You would release a balloon some distance away and then you'd use a theodolite to measure the angle.

1925
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:46,900
But the Foo Fighters were not really described as looking like balloons.

1926
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:51,900
They would follow vapor trails that seem to lock on to flight or fight paths.

1927
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:56,900
So it's a really interesting government report that I think is the earliest known assessment.

1928
01:38:56,900 --> 01:39:00,900
I think it was a 48 and I credit to John Greenwell for putting it on his site.

1929
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:04,900
And I think his project signed one of their first reports.

1930
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:06,900
I think it was late 48.

1931
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:15,900
But it said that the most commonly reported shapes or morphologies are silver disks and spheres and balls of fire.

1932
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:20,900
And then they go on to hypothesize that the balls of fire are viewed at night and the metallic spheres,

1933
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:24,900
which again, there's that through line all the way through, are viewed during the daytime.

1934
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:28,900
Did they all disappear when cameras were invented?

1935
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:30,900
Kirk Patton.

1936
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:32,900
There's the Middle East Orb as a metallic sphere.

1937
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:35,900
The Navy Slime video is a metallic sphere.

1938
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,900
Go fast, arguably, is a sphere.

1939
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:42,900
In the public domain, like America is a big country and there's like a billion cameras in America.

1940
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:45,900
We don't really have any good videos of these metallic spheres.

1941
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:46,900
I don't disagree.

1942
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:47,900
Oh, actually, that's not true.

1943
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:48,900
There's a tap.

1944
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:49,900
That's not true.

1945
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,900
That's absolutely not true.

1946
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:52,900
The Manchester one?

1947
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:53,900
Sorry?

1948
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:54,900
You're thinking the Manchester one?

1949
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:55,900
No, no, LAX.

1950
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:56,900
Let's keep going.

1951
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:57,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1952
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:59,900
We can go on and on.

1953
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:00,900
Okay.

1954
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:01,900
So let's go Gimbal.

1955
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:02,900
Gimbal.

1956
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:09,900
Do you think there's anything, there's probably enough unique to say here that we should hit this because we are a little pressed for time?

1957
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:10,900
Yeah, I think we can tap up here.

1958
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:11,900
Absolutely.

1959
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:16,900
No, but I want to get into contemporary stuff too, but do you think this is definitely worth touching on Gimbal?

1960
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:17,900
100%.

1961
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:18,900
Absolutely.

1962
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:19,900
I think this might be the most compelling.

1963
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:21,900
So should I set it up real quick?

1964
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:22,900
Yeah, yeah.

1965
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:26,900
So very, very quickly, this is Ryan Graves Squadron.

1966
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:28,900
I think it's VFA 11, the Red Rippers.

1967
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:31,900
They had just done a fairly complex air-to-air training mission.

1968
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:34,900
They're just like the Tic Tac incident.

1969
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:40,900
They are, I believe this is a pre-deployment workup cycle, so they're doing their training before they ship out to the Middle East.

1970
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:49,900
And they had done a pretty complex air-to-air mission off of Florida, so the carrier is out there.

1971
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:56,900
They're heading back to the ship, and one of Ryan's buddies, the WIZO, the backseater that we were talking about.

1972
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:58,900
The WIZO is Weapons Systems Officer.

1973
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:00,900
Weapons Systems Officer, thank you, the backseater.

1974
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:03,900
They're circling the land, so they all come down at once.

1975
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:06,900
They kind of, they hang out, so they clear the airspace.

1976
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:16,900
And they got hit on their radar and to this object, and they went to go investigate.

1977
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:25,900
And the video kind of picks up as they're kind of trying to sneak in behind it on what they call a stern conversion.

1978
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:30,900
And yeah, the video captures some very interesting maneuvers.

1979
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:34,900
And this is, yeah, so that's why it's called the gimbal, right?

1980
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:37,900
You see it sort of rotating in this interesting way.

1981
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:40,900
Well, look, who named GoFast?

1982
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:42,900
Clearly, the name wasn't correct, right?

1983
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:43,900
The aircrew didn't name it.

1984
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,900
Somebody at the Pentagon named it.

1985
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:47,900
So is the name gimbal correct or not?

1986
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:49,900
Because it could be correct because they're calling it that because it's tilting,

1987
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:53,900
or it could be correct because it's the gimbal motion of the camera which is causing the rotation.

1988
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:56,900
I love one of your first thoughts was that it was a training video.

1989
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:59,900
People have told me it was a training video.

1990
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:01,900
Who told you that?

1991
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:06,900
I don't remember now, but I asked Susan Go, and she told me it wasn't a training video.

1992
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:08,900
Who said the last?

1993
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:09,900
Susan Goff.

1994
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:10,900
Oh, Susan Goff.

1995
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:16,900
But didn't Susan Goff like run PsiOp for the DOT or something when it came to rallying support for the Afghani war?

1996
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:18,900
I'm just telling you what she told me.

1997
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:22,900
Don't take that prima facie.

1998
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:27,900
She wrote an academic paper on psychological operation.

1999
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:29,900
So that's why there is suspicion of her.

2000
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:36,900
But then she seems to be kind of tight with Kirkpatrick, or at least in the context of one conference.

2001
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:42,900
I met Kirkpatrick in person, and I was there at that incident, and she was attached at his hip, would not leave.

2002
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:43,900
So that's interesting.

2003
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:52,900
This is the former director of Aero, this office we keep bringing up, the kind of authoritative all-domain anomalous research office.

2004
01:42:53,900 --> 01:43:00,900
And you have its former director, Kirkpatrick, speaking at some event, and then Susan Goff is just kind of like trailing him.

2005
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:01,900
Correct.

2006
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:05,900
So this is like November 2023, I think at George Mason University.

2007
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:06,900
So I was there.

2008
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:08,900
I just happened to be in D.C. for other business.

2009
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:14,900
And I went and had a chat with Kirkpatrick afterwards, and Susan was right there.

2010
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:19,900
And that continues if you saw the current director, John Kozlowski, just testified.

2011
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:21,900
And Susan Goff's in the background.

2012
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:22,900
Right in the background.

2013
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:30,900
And so you could probably find millions of Reddit threads that she's the handler.

2014
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:32,900
I mean, there must be a reason why she's there.

2015
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:36,900
So the simplest reason is that she's there so that he doesn't say things that he's not supposed to say.

2016
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,900
Not because there's something hidden.

2017
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:40,900
I would like him to say things that he's not supposed to say.

2018
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:42,900
Well, yeah, everybody would.

2019
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:44,900
It's just like the lawyers you see behind people.

2020
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:50,900
They never whispered to her and asked her whether she should say anything, but then she would leap in and stop him if he says something bad.

2021
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:54,900
A lot of senior government we talked about that, like, that is unique.

2022
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:55,900
That is unique.

2023
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:59,900
It does seem a little strange, also, that I would like to hear what the explanation is.

2024
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:02,900
But she said that the Gimbal video is not a training video.

2025
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:03,900
Yeah.

2026
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:04,900
A couple of years ago.

2027
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:05,900
Did she say anything else?

2028
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:07,900
Did she say, I think this video is real?

2029
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:10,900
No, she gives these boilerplate answers for a lot of stuff.

2030
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:11,900
Gun-based.

2031
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:12,900
It's a bit frustrating.

2032
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:13,900
Okay.

2033
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:14,900
This is like, say a lot without saying anything.

2034
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:18,900
It's like ten questions and seven of them come back as, like, we don't discuss that.

2035
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:20,900
In more words.

2036
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:21,900
Gotcha.

2037
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:22,900
It's a little frustrating.

2038
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:23,900
How were you able to get in touch with her?

2039
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:24,900
Just e-mailed her.

2040
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:25,900
Wow.

2041
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:26,900
All right.

2042
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:27,900
She doesn't answer my emails.

2043
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:28,900
Yeah.

2044
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:30,900
I was going to say, I doubt she would answer mine as well.

2045
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:31,900
Okay.

2046
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:36,900
So, yeah, so I guess it's probably, you know, you set this up, right?

2047
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,900
So do you have anything to say on the Gimbal?

2048
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:39,900
On Gimbal?

2049
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:40,900
Yeah.

2050
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:41,900
Yeah, Gimbal.

2051
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:42,900
I think, again, we've got two aspects of it.

2052
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:45,900
Is it demonstrating something anomalous and what is it?

2053
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:52,900
And with the anomalous thing that people claim in this video is that it's a saucer-shaped

2054
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:56,900
craft, like a flying saucer, that kind of tilts up on its side, which is aerodynamically

2055
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:57,900
impossible.

2056
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:00,900
It would kind of fall out of the sky if it did that.

2057
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:06,900
And that proves that it's some kind of, you know, advanced technology for possibly aliens.

2058
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:12,900
But the analysis I've done suggests that it might actually be a camera artifact rather

2059
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:15,900
than the actual shape of the object.

2060
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:18,900
So what we're seeing here is a saucer shape.

2061
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:20,900
It could be just the glare.

2062
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:23,900
I know Merrick doesn't like the word glare.

2063
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:24,900
The experts don't like it.

2064
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:26,900
They don't know what I'm talking about when I say it.

2065
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:27,900
Nobody knows what that is.

2066
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:31,900
The problem with that is that we don't actually have in optics the terminology for things

2067
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:34,900
like glare and lens flare often overlaps.

2068
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:35,900
It's called blooming.

2069
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:36,900
It's a well-known artifact.

2070
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:41,900
Sensor bloom is something that people sometimes call glare as well, but we don't know what's

2071
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:42,900
actually going on.

2072
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:44,900
But basically, there's an optical effect here.

2073
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:46,900
And there's a number of indications in the video.

2074
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:51,900
You can see, for example, there are bands of light and dark in the background that rotate

2075
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:56,900
with the object itself when it's rotating, which kind of suggests that it's the camera

2076
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:59,900
that's doing the rotating rather than the object itself.

2077
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:03,900
There's things that look like little diffraction spikes on the top and bottom, left and right,

2078
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:07,900
and even a little bit hint of the 45 degrees on this object, which make it look like it's

2079
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:09,900
some kind of optical effect.

2080
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:15,900
There's instances where the turn rate of the object kind of seems to deviate from the turn

2081
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:17,900
rate of the horizon.

2082
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:23,900
And then perhaps the biggest thing is that the amount that it rotates and the speed and

2083
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:29,900
the time is all exactly the same amount that would be required for the camera to have to

2084
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:32,900
rotate to traverse the forward-looking direction.

2085
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:36,900
Because these cameras, here's going to talk a little bit, it's not mounted like the cameras

2086
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:44,900
you see under helicopters or even like a drone where the camera's like this and it can rotate

2087
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:45,900
around like this.

2088
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,900
It doesn't have the ability to rotate around.

2089
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:54,900
So it has to rotate using a kind of a roll plus a tilt, which means the camera rotates.

2090
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,900
And then that makes the picture rotate.

2091
01:46:57,900 --> 01:47:03,900
So it has to derotate that afterwards inside the camera using a device or using some kind of

2092
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:05,900
software to rotate the image.

2093
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:07,900
And that rotates the image back the right way.

2094
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:12,900
So nothing appears to rotate, but this optical effect within it, because it's tied to the

2095
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,900
camera, the optical effect rotates.

2096
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,900
There's like a glare that rotates.

2097
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:20,900
Like if you look at, say, this light over here, you can kind of see like around the light,

2098
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:23,900
there's kind of a shade, little spikes and things.

2099
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:28,900
If you turn your head, a better thing if you look at that light, squint a bit like that,

2100
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:34,900
squint with your eyes and then kind of rotate your head left and right, you'll see the rays

2101
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:36,900
that come from it are kind of rotating around.

2102
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:40,900
And that's what's happening, I think, in this video.

2103
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:43,900
There's an optical effect similar to what you saw there.

2104
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:45,900
I've got spots in my eyes now.

2105
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:52,900
And the rotation plus the derotation creates this illusion.

2106
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:56,900
So it's like a camera turning plus lack of focus or something.

2107
01:47:56,900 --> 01:48:00,900
Yeah, the lack of focus actually might be something that's actually going on there as well,

2108
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:07,900
which the focus is something that actually changes the shape of these optical effects.

2109
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:10,900
And Mary doesn't like glare, so I'm going to call it an optical effect.

2110
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:14,900
I think there's enough evidence in there that that's actually happening.

2111
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:19,900
Beyond that, we don't actually know for sure what we're looking at.

2112
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:22,900
And my hypothesis is that it's a distant jet.

2113
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:26,900
And the reason I think that is that if you do this analysis with the lines of sight,

2114
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:31,900
you can find a path in the distance that's more or less a straight line.

2115
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:35,900
It's kind of like a slight S-turn about that.

2116
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:42,900
And if you come closer, you get these kind of weird kind of like J-hooks

2117
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:45,900
that have been described by Ryan Graves, I think.

2118
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:50,900
And there's some debate as to whether this straight line of a possible jet engine

2119
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:56,900
powered aircraft or this J-hook powered by some kind of weird anti-gravity thing

2120
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:59,900
is the more plausible of the two explanations.

2121
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:04,900
And a lot of people, you know, UFO fans, would go with this one

2122
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:09,900
because it matches the verbal description and the distance that was given.

2123
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:13,900
I think it started out, they originally said like 8 to 10 miles and changed to 6 to 8.

2124
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:18,900
I think 6 to 8 is the current estimate of the distance, 6 to 8 nautical miles.

2125
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:21,900
And if you do the analysis there, you do get this kind of J-hook,

2126
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:29,900
which does somewhat resemble the verbal description of the pilots or Ryan Graves specifically

2127
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:34,900
when he describes what he saw on the radar page, the SR page.

2128
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:36,900
So that's kind of the debate.

2129
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:38,900
Super simple theory, thanks, Scott.

2130
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:40,900
What do you say, Meric?

2131
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:41,900
Ockham, I say Ockham.

2132
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:45,900
So I put that you've seen this before, but it's quite simple.

2133
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:54,900
On one side, what the aviator, what the aircrew say is a remarkable match with the data and the video.

2134
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:58,900
On the other side, you have these cascading malfunctions in this anomaly,

2135
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:01,900
this artifact that nobody's ever heard of.

2136
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:07,900
And I've looped you in with, I think, several of the top experts in the world on this.

2137
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:09,900
I've not heard of it when we've got videos of it.

2138
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:11,900
Not this video, other videos.

2139
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:14,900
There's zero evidence of what you're proposing.

2140
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:15,900
No.

2141
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:17,900
There's zero empirical evidence of what you're...

2142
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:20,900
How do you have evidence of glare, like in Dave Falch's videos, for example?

2143
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:21,900
That's all blooming.

2144
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:28,900
So the point is, I'm on Team Ockham here, and I'm on all the data lines, the video, the rotation...

2145
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:29,900
You say Ockham, you're referring to Ockham's Razor?

2146
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:30,900
Sorry, yes.

2147
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:33,900
So Ockham's Razor, named after William of Ockham,

2148
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:36,900
the most parsimonious, simplest explanation is usually the right one.

2149
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:37,900
It is.

2150
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:45,900
The assumptions here, the cascading of failures and malfunctions and unseen artifacts

2151
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:49,900
that Mick proposes and requires for his theory is just...

2152
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:51,900
We'd be here all afternoon and probably through the weekend.

2153
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:54,900
There's kind of a lot missing from the left side of that page, though.

2154
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:56,900
You have to kind of...

2155
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,900
My side of the page basically gives a complete explanation.

2156
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:02,900
Your side of the page just says, oh, it was some kind of thing that was moving.

2157
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:05,900
Can I bring my analytic kind of perspective to this real quick?

2158
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:06,900
Yeah, yeah.

2159
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:08,900
Why is it Ockham's Razor?

2160
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:13,900
Well, because I don't have to account for an extraordinary amount of malfunctions

2161
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:15,900
and never before seen...

2162
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:16,900
New technology.

2163
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:18,900
So that's even new physics.

2164
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:21,900
So Ockham says nothing about the nature of an assumption.

2165
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:24,900
He's talking purely about volume and the number of assumptions.

2166
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:25,900
He's not talking really about assumptions.

2167
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:27,900
He's talking about entities.

2168
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:29,900
Least number of entities to explain it then.

2169
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:30,900
Correct.

2170
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:31,900
You have to create the right answer.

2171
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:34,900
What a big new entity, which is an entirely new form of proposal.

2172
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:36,900
Ockham is silent on the nature of the entity.

2173
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:38,900
Let me just bring him the analytic perspective.

2174
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:39,900
So what's super interesting...

2175
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:42,900
I don't think he can just count entities and say, like, I have one...

2176
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:44,900
All right, let me respond.

2177
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:46,900
I mean, it's not mine personally, right?

2178
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,900
I think Ockham would be rolling in his grave if he were to say...

2179
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:52,900
Well, I think Ockham would be rolling in his grave if it was used in a rationalist framework

2180
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:54,900
because he was a 13th century monk.

2181
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:56,900
And so I think the fact that...

2182
01:51:56,900 --> 01:51:58,900
He probably wouldn't mind invoking angels.

2183
01:51:58,900 --> 01:51:59,900
What's that?

2184
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:00,900
He wouldn't mind invoking angels.

2185
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:01,900
Oh, he wouldn't.

2186
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:05,900
I'm thinking God because that's the least number of entities to explain any miracle.

2187
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:07,900
So let me just...

2188
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:13,900
Let's just operate off a hypothesis that this was, in fact, a very bright, very anomalous...

2189
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:15,900
Let's just say sauce or shapecraft.

2190
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:17,900
Let's just go with that, just for hypothesis.

2191
01:52:17,900 --> 01:52:19,900
At the end of the video, it's on its edge, right?

2192
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:21,900
Slightly over.

2193
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:22,900
OK, fair enough.

2194
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:23,900
But it's on its edge.

2195
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:25,900
Well, it goes past vertical.

2196
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:26,900
OK, fine.

2197
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:28,900
No, I'm just...

2198
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:29,900
No, no, fair enough.

2199
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:30,900
Fiddly with my details.

2200
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:32,900
Yeah, that's fair enough.

2201
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:36,900
And according to the air crew, there's no evidence for this,

2202
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:40,900
but according to the air crew, it wobbles after the video cuts out, right?

2203
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:43,900
Yeah, that's, I think, Brian Graves, did he say that?

2204
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:44,900
Correct.

2205
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:45,900
Yeah.

2206
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:50,900
So maybe if the aviator comes out and he says it wobbled, that's interesting.

2207
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:53,900
So let me just put on my analytic hat real quick and bear with me.

2208
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:55,900
I'll do this as quickly as I can.

2209
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:57,900
You mentioned the Theodolite, the tracking.

2210
01:52:57,900 --> 01:53:02,900
In the 1940s, I'm going to list several cases here, and they get very interesting.

2211
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:08,900
April 1947, this is months before Kenneth Arnold's sighting,

2212
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:13,900
which kicked off the flying saucer craze, if you want to call it that.

2213
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:19,900
Four months prior to that, two Weather Bureau employees observed four metallic disks

2214
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:21,900
flat on the bottom, domed on the top.

2215
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:27,900
And the US government assessed, because they occurred previous to Arnold's sighting,

2216
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:31,900
they were not influenced by hysteria, mass media, anything like that.

2217
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:32,900
They reported internally.

2218
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:34,900
They never actually said this publicly.

2219
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:36,900
So that is quite interesting.

2220
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:37,900
Now let's move on.

2221
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:40,900
Portland, 1947, July.

2222
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:47,900
Five police officers see a total of nine disks going different directions.

2223
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:52,900
So five cops, three cops, and one cop see different disks going in different directions,

2224
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:53,900
wobbling or oscillating.

2225
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:58,900
You can see this in the Project Sign raw reporting.

2226
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:02,900
New Mexico, this is in the very famous Life Magazine article of 1947.

2227
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:08,900
One of the Navy's top astronomers observes and takes various precise measurements of a disk,

2228
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:11,900
and he observes it wobbling.

2229
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:17,900
Masala, Japan, 1952, training exercise, a guy's flying, doing intercepts,

2230
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:22,900
and he sees a disk come up to his plane that engages in a slow fluttering motion,

2231
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:26,900
rocks back and forth, and flipped on its edge.

2232
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:29,900
Direct quote, direct quote, flipped on its edge.

2233
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:35,900
Southern California, Lockheed Martin aircrew is in the air.

2234
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:43,900
They see an elliptical object flying over the Channel Islands, kind of a hot spot if you're following this.

2235
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:50,900
Kelly Johnson, who is the skunkworks, basically the most famous,

2236
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:55,900
the most well-known aeronautical engineer in American history, sees the same object from his ranch.

2237
01:54:55,900 --> 01:55:00,900
So you have two different perspectives, and they both saw this object.

2238
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:01,900
Pretty credible.

2239
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:05,900
And he actually goes on to say, I'm a believer in flying saucers,

2240
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:10,900
the most kind of credentialed aeronautical engineer that we know of in American history.

2241
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:15,900
Exeter, New Hampshire, 1964, four people, two cops,

2242
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:22,900
see a large disk from 100 feet away and 100 feet altitude engaging in a wobbling motion.

2243
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:27,900
Westall, 1966, Australia, 200 or 300, depending on the accounts,

2244
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:33,900
and a teacher sees a silver disk sort of banked on its side, then took off at a thousand miles per hour.

2245
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:41,900
Beverly, Massachusetts, 1966, nine witnesses, two law enforcement officers see a metallic plate-like object

2246
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:45,900
that hovers 20 feet, according to three women, over their heads.

2247
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:46,900
20 feet.

2248
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:48,900
I see Mick's rolling his eyes.

2249
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:51,900
I'm just reporting what people have said.

2250
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:57,900
Minot Air Force Base, home of nuclear weapons missiles,

2251
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:07,900
a Border Patrol officer sees a metallic disk, direct quote, wobbling on its edge, 30 feet wide, 100 feet away.

2252
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:12,900
Five days later, the Air Force base...

2253
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:14,900
Does your point just say a lot of UFOs wobble?

2254
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:18,900
The Air Force, these are all in government records, right?

2255
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:19,900
Are we noticing a consistency?

2256
01:56:19,900 --> 01:56:20,900
I'll finish up, we'll be quick.

2257
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:23,900
Well, yeah, you pick the ones that wobble.

2258
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:30,900
These are the close encounters and probably the best known encounters, and you do see a consistency here, right?

2259
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:32,900
Well, I have to see what the steps are.

2260
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:36,900
If these witnesses are close enough to observe wobbling, I think they can see the shape, right?

2261
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:44,900
Anyway, quickly finish up, Porter's County, law enforcement officers chase a large metallic disk-like object

2262
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:47,900
for 90 minutes going 86 miles.

2263
01:56:47,900 --> 01:56:53,900
Michigan, swamp gas, you also see large disk-like objects.

2264
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:59,900
Redlands, California, this is one of the most extraordinary cases that really hasn't got a lot of press.

2265
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:05,900
200 people see silver disk, 40, 50 feet in diameter, 200 feet altitude.

2266
01:57:05,900 --> 01:57:11,900
1968, Redlands, California, James McDonald did it.

2267
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:12,900
Fair enough.

2268
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:16,900
Broadhaven, UK, 10 students see a silver disk.

2269
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:18,900
They draw pictures, they're identical.

2270
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:21,900
Ariel, we all know the Ariel case, or a lot of people know the Ariel case.

2271
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:23,900
62 students see a silver disk.

2272
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:25,900
Pictures, identical, this disk is surrounded by-

2273
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:27,900
The pictures are not identical.

2274
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:29,900
There's a huge variety of pictures.

2275
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:30,900
It's all the same kind of shape.

2276
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:34,900
They look vaguely like a variety of children's drawings of flying saucers.

2277
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:40,900
What I'm saying is you have this extraordinary amount of failures,

2278
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:43,900
never before seen artifacts that just happen to you.

2279
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:45,900
I don't agree with all the things that are on that thing.

2280
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:46,900
I think they all have to happen.

2281
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:48,900
What are the failures?

2282
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:53,900
You're missing everything that I've ever hypothesized is that everything has to happen all at the same time, which isn't true.

2283
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:54,900
Of course it has to happen, right?

2284
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:56,900
Because you have a radar malfunction or-

2285
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:58,900
So what's on the radar?

2286
01:57:58,900 --> 01:57:59,900
I don't know what's on the radar.

2287
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:00,900
We have to account for it.

2288
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,900
Writing a theory, you have to account for it.

2289
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:03,900
Well, it could be a distant plane.

2290
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:05,900
Well, what's on the radar that's six miles away?

2291
01:58:05,900 --> 01:58:06,900
I don't know.

2292
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:09,900
It could be like a training exercise site thing, which they said it wasn't,

2293
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:12,900
or it could be a malfunction, or it could be some kind of weather anomaly.

2294
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:13,900
It could be balloons.

2295
01:58:13,900 --> 01:58:14,900
We don't know what it is.

2296
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:18,900
Well, they're going west, so it's coming from the east, so it's going against very strong winds.

2297
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:19,900
We could rule out balloons on-

2298
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:20,900
We could just cross that out.

2299
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:22,900
The aircrew saw something on the radar.

2300
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:23,900
Yes, I agree with it.

2301
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:24,900
You don't have to account for what it is.

2302
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:26,900
You didn't account for what the object actually is.

2303
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:29,900
You just said the aircrew saw this object.

2304
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:30,900
You're not telling me what it is.

2305
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:31,900
So it's the same thing.

2306
01:58:31,900 --> 01:58:32,900
I'm not following.

2307
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:35,900
But the bottom line is, can we pull up the video?

2308
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:41,900
Because the match between the flight path that we can reconstruct-

2309
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:45,900
Don't mind the F-bombs.

2310
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:48,900
Don't mind the F-bombs.

2311
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:07,900
And that's the anomalous thing about this video, is you have 120 miles not wind-

2312
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:08,900
They're going against it.

2313
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:09,900
They're going against the object.

2314
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:10,900
Correct.

2315
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:11,900
Well, it's not like planes can't fly against the wind.

2316
01:59:11,900 --> 01:59:12,900
Well, you suggested balloons.

2317
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:13,900
So could we rule out balloons?

2318
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:14,900
No, I don't think this is a balloon.

2319
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:15,900
Well, no, the objects-

2320
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:20,900
The fleet is going against the wind.

2321
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:21,900
Right.

2322
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:23,900
So you just said that those could be balloons.

2323
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:24,900
Are they balloons?

2324
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:25,900
No, I didn't say those could be balloons.

2325
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:26,900
That's a different fleet.

2326
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:28,900
This is a fleet of five objects.

2327
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:30,900
Would a plane be able to rotate like that?

2328
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:31,900
I mean, that doesn't-

2329
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:34,900
The fleet described by Ryan Graves is nothing at all like the GoFast fleet.

2330
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:36,900
We should really dive into the empirical evidence.

2331
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:37,900
Let's get to the evidence, right?

2332
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:38,900
And we have a lot.

2333
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:40,900
If you mind just flipping over to the-

2334
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:41,900
Video is the evidence.

2335
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:48,900
We have empirical evidence of what jets look like with this camera system.

2336
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:52,900
So if you just cruise down, maybe, we don't have time to get through all this.

2337
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:54,900
I mean, we have a ton of that.

2338
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:55,900
Let's just start there.

2339
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:56,900
That's, yeah.

2340
01:59:56,900 --> 01:59:57,900
Yep.

2341
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:58,900
Actually, no.

2342
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:02,900
So maybe we can, I don't know if we can play it here, but maybe we can add this in.

2343
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:03,900
Yeah, yeah.

2344
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:04,900
But there's a-

2345
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:10,900
We can reconstruct, and Mick mentioned this kind of this vertical U-turn, this J-hook path

2346
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:19,900
that matches precisely with what the aircrew say that the object that was tracked on radar does.

2347
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:23,900
And when you play that video, you'll see that there's a series of rotations,

2348
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:30,900
and then there's one really kind of pronounced one that is slower than the others,

2349
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:33,900
and that coincides with the apex of that turn.

2350
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:36,900
And if you play it, it is a remarkable match,

2351
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:39,900
and I got a couple other videos there that maybe we can throw in when we edit this.

2352
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:44,900
But using Mick's sim, and again, Mick, thank you for making this possible.

2353
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:49,900
It is remarkable when you watch that thing just ride up the reconstructed flight path.

2354
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:50,900
It is a remarkable match.

2355
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:51,900
You keep saying remarkable.

2356
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:52,900
It is.

2357
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:55,900
I think you used that word a little bit too much, because this isn't remarkable.

2358
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:58,900
What we're seeing here is a curve that's basically a mathematical projection-

2359
02:00:58,900 --> 02:00:59,900
It's not.

2360
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:00,900
It's flat.

2361
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:02,900
Of the path of the jet onto a straight line in the distance.

2362
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:05,900
If you take what the actual jet did with the camera did,

2363
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:07,900
which was just basically do a little turn like that,

2364
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:10,900
and then draw a line over here, which is another jet,

2365
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:12,900
and then draw the lines of sight between the two,

2366
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:17,900
you're going to get these J-hooks if you slice a plane through the lines at that point.

2367
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:20,900
And if you move them closer, it gets a bit more curvy, and then it kind of flattens out.

2368
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:22,900
But if you draw it there, it's just a mathematical projection.

2369
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:24,900
It looks the same.

2370
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:25,900
It looks like the same curve.

2371
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:28,900
And this rotation of the object that Marek talks about,

2372
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:30,900
yes, it happens at about the same time as that curve-

2373
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:31,900
It's exactly the same time.

2374
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:37,900
But that's the same time that we're traversing the singularity in the gimbal,

2375
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:38,900
and it has to do these rotations.

2376
02:01:38,900 --> 02:01:40,900
So it's doing these big rotations.

2377
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:41,900
And it's not the same.

2378
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:42,900
It doesn't match the curves.

2379
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:43,900
It does.

2380
02:01:43,900 --> 02:01:45,900
It happens roughly in the same region.

2381
02:01:45,900 --> 02:01:46,900
We can pull up your shim right now.

2382
02:01:46,900 --> 02:01:48,900
You want to pull up your shim right now and do it?

2383
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:50,900
There's three other rotations that don't match.

2384
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:54,900
The one big one is kind of roughly at the end, but it doesn't really match.

2385
02:01:54,900 --> 02:01:57,900
It's kind of like a bit of a reach.

2386
02:01:57,900 --> 02:01:58,900
It's not remarkable.

2387
02:01:58,900 --> 02:01:59,900
It's not a remarkable correlation.

2388
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:03,900
I will let the viewers, maybe we can put this in,

2389
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:05,900
but I really want to show people.

2390
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:07,900
And this is directly from McSim.

2391
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:10,900
I think, more importantly, let's just bottom line this.

2392
02:02:10,900 --> 02:02:14,900
Well, real quick, though, on just the audio associated with this,

2393
02:02:14,900 --> 02:02:19,900
do you think the operators of these systems are confused at what they're seeing?

2394
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:21,900
Because they seem to think it's remarkable.

2395
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:23,900
So their eyes are playing tricks on them or something?

2396
02:02:23,900 --> 02:02:24,900
We obviously don't know what they're seeing,

2397
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:28,900
which means either it's just something that they don't recognize.

2398
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:33,900
Yeah, but if you're using the camera's rotation as a way to explain it away,

2399
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:36,900
then presumably that would be very easy to be like,

2400
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:38,900
that was just the camera's rotation.

2401
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:39,900
There's no wow factor at all.

2402
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:43,900
The smoking gun for me was that it rotates in steps in that system.

2403
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:45,900
There's zero empirical evidence.

2404
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:47,900
But we talked to Mr. Snow.

2405
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:49,900
There's no evidence in that system.

2406
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:53,900
You asked him if he had seen that before, and he said yes.

2407
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:54,900
He has seen it.

2408
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:55,900
You don't believe him.

2409
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:56,900
He's the expert.

2410
02:02:56,900 --> 02:02:58,900
It's absolutely possible.

2411
02:02:58,900 --> 02:03:01,900
Nobody else has seen that and is aware of that.

2412
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:02,900
That's fair enough.

2413
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:06,900
But we did talk to truly the top experts in the world on this.

2414
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:08,900
I won't go on the record, surprisingly enough.

2415
02:03:08,900 --> 02:03:10,900
And that is part of the stigma.

2416
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:13,900
I had a Zoom call with one of those individuals.

2417
02:03:13,900 --> 02:03:14,900
I sent you...

2418
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:15,900
Can we say who this is?

2419
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:17,900
I can't, unfortunately.

2420
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:18,900
And I had a Zoom call with...

2421
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:20,900
And when you say experts, experts from a military perspective.

2422
02:03:20,900 --> 02:03:22,900
So let me just run through.

2423
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:24,900
So we talked to a senior Raytheon engineer who was,

2424
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:26,900
let's say, intimately familiar with the system.

2425
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:28,900
I don't want to give away too much.

2426
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:30,900
We talked to two of the...

2427
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:34,900
I think it's fair to say that the two top academic experts

2428
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:38,900
on this type of technology, not the FLIRT, not the...

2429
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:39,900
So we have the ATFLIRT.

2430
02:03:39,900 --> 02:03:40,900
Sensor technology.

2431
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:42,900
Yeah, it's called indium antimonide.

2432
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:43,900
Right.

2433
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:47,900
And they were all truly perplexed by it.

2434
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:50,900
The one that I talked to, and to your point about why

2435
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:52,900
won't they go on the record, he said,

2436
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:54,900
I am intrigued by this.

2437
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:55,900
I sent you an email.

2438
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:56,900
This is very interesting.

2439
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:57,900
We had a long talk.

2440
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:58,900
I don't want to get involved in this.

2441
02:03:58,900 --> 02:04:00,900
But highly credentialed.

2442
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:02,900
But just the stigma is still there.

2443
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:03,900
And what did they say?

2444
02:04:03,900 --> 02:04:04,900
Did you give them mixed hypothesis?

2445
02:04:04,900 --> 02:04:05,900
Yeah, so we had a lengthy...

2446
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:06,900
We had a lengthy...

2447
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:08,900
So basically they debunked mixed glare on the glass.

2448
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:11,900
Would you agree that they debunked your glare on the glass?

2449
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:14,900
The glare on the glass is a pretty old notion of the theory.

2450
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:16,900
No, that's what you've been saying

2451
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:17,900
until we indicated he's expert.

2452
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:19,900
That was your theory.

2453
02:04:19,900 --> 02:04:22,900
You did just say old version of the theory as a fear.

2454
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:23,900
The theory is...

2455
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:26,900
Oh, no, glare on the glass was just one possible way

2456
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:28,900
that you could get this shape.

2457
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:30,900
But that's the only thing you've said

2458
02:04:30,900 --> 02:04:31,900
for seven years about this thing.

2459
02:04:31,900 --> 02:04:32,900
You've never said...

2460
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:35,900
No, it could be something along the internal optical path

2461
02:04:35,900 --> 02:04:38,900
of the thing.

2462
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:41,900
Basically, the aperture of the camera

2463
02:04:41,900 --> 02:04:42,900
creates this coming in shape.

2464
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:44,900
There's no such thing as glare.

2465
02:04:44,900 --> 02:04:45,900
When Mick talks...

2466
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:48,900
I really want to show people what this looks like.

2467
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:51,900
What he says glare is glare is called blooming.

2468
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:52,900
That's when...

2469
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:54,900
I'm not a scientist, but I've read enough.

2470
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:57,900
This is part of why I want people to get engaged.

2471
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:02,900
Gloaming is when there's so much energy

2472
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:04,900
being directed at a pixel

2473
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:07,900
that it overcharges it and it spills over.

2474
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:10,900
There's no way that that could result in that.

2475
02:05:10,900 --> 02:05:12,900
We agree that blooming is not...

2476
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:13,900
I disagree.

2477
02:05:13,900 --> 02:05:14,900
Sorry?

2478
02:05:14,900 --> 02:05:15,900
I disagree.

2479
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:17,900
How could blooming...

2480
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:19,900
Blooming could create a shape.

2481
02:05:19,900 --> 02:05:20,900
I don't think it is blooming.

2482
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:22,900
One of the experts right here said,

2483
02:05:22,900 --> 02:05:24,900
no blooming in indium antimonide

2484
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:26,900
would not explain this rotation.

2485
02:05:26,900 --> 02:05:28,900
That was right after he said Mick might be right,

2486
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:29,900
but for the wrong reasons.

2487
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:31,900
No, this is a different expert.

2488
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:33,900
I'll just leave it at this.

2489
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:35,900
One of the top academic experts

2490
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:38,900
deferred to one of the top government experts

2491
02:05:38,900 --> 02:05:40,900
on air-to-air FLIR imagery.

2492
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:41,900
This guy...

2493
02:05:41,900 --> 02:05:42,900
You saw this, right?

2494
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:46,900
He specifically refuted your theory.

2495
02:05:46,900 --> 02:05:47,900
I'll read it.

2496
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:50,900
The object in the video is definitely maneuvering,

2497
02:05:50,900 --> 02:05:52,900
causing the appearance of rotation.

2498
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:54,900
A D-roll axis of the payload

2499
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:56,900
would not make this phenomenon of rotation.

2500
02:05:56,900 --> 02:05:58,900
This is specifically to your theory.

2501
02:05:58,900 --> 02:06:02,900
This is arguably the top expert in the US government.

2502
02:06:02,900 --> 02:06:03,900
I think...

2503
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:05,900
In air-to-air FLIR imagery.

2504
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:07,900
I think really he...

2505
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:10,900
You're interpreting things that he told you.

2506
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:12,900
No, I'm talking about the government expert.

2507
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:14,900
Are you reading verbatim?

2508
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:17,900
Let me quote him.

2509
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:18,900
He said to me,

2510
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:21,900
I would not want my response sent out as I am government,

2511
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:23,900
and it might be seen as an expert official response

2512
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:26,900
rather than an opinion based upon limited real information.

2513
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:28,900
I just wanted to point some things out

2514
02:06:28,900 --> 02:06:30,900
that others may have missed.

2515
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:32,900
Well, I'm reading what he said.

2516
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:34,900
We all have limited info.

2517
02:06:34,900 --> 02:06:39,900
I guess, specifically, to Merrick's glare point,

2518
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:42,900
you mentioned, okay, that's probably

2519
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:44,900
the earliest version of the argument.

2520
02:06:44,900 --> 02:06:45,900
You've updated it.

2521
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:47,900
You're talking about the internal optical system.

2522
02:06:47,900 --> 02:06:48,900
What does that mean?

2523
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:49,900
What is your argument now?

2524
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:51,900
Because now that glare's been ruled out, what is it?

2525
02:06:51,900 --> 02:06:53,900
Because these guys are saying glare in quotes.

2526
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:55,900
Yeah, but then they don't want to talk about glare.

2527
02:06:55,900 --> 02:06:56,900
No, they didn't.

2528
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:58,900
He said there isn't a point spread function.

2529
02:06:58,900 --> 02:07:00,900
Then he talks about a point spread function.

2530
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:03,900
He puts glare in quotes, and he says it's all an internal...

2531
02:07:03,900 --> 02:07:05,900
And Yannick did a great job.

2532
02:07:05,900 --> 02:07:07,900
Yannick said, how do you reconcile this, quote,

2533
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:10,900
glare on the glass, all the self-congratulating discussions

2534
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:12,900
on Metabunk about glare spread for glare...

2535
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:13,900
That's Yannick.

2536
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:15,900
That's not an expert, so is it?

2537
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:17,900
...that grows with the...

2538
02:07:17,900 --> 02:07:18,900
You know, right?

2539
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:19,900
How do you...

2540
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:20,900
And this is the best part.

2541
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:25,900
So Mick's big explainer video is based on a cheap,

2542
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:27,900
what is it, 200 bucks, FLIR camera

2543
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:29,900
that this expert said is not a good comparison.

2544
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:31,900
No, no, it's not a good comparison at all.

2545
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:33,900
That was just an example of how you can get a rotation glare.

2546
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:35,900
He literally calls you out.

2547
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:37,900
It's just not a good comparison.

2548
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:39,900
There's no empirical evidence...

2549
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:42,900
A FLIR one, which costs $200 versus an app FLIR,

2550
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:45,900
which costs a million dollars, is not going to be a very good comparison.

2551
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:47,900
So anyway, bottom line is we have a lot,

2552
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:50,900
we have a ton of air-to-air footage,

2553
02:07:50,900 --> 02:07:52,900
and there's zero empirical evidence.

2554
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:55,900
And you have experts who don't want to be quoted.

2555
02:07:55,900 --> 02:07:56,900
Okay.

2556
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:57,900
Do you want to loop me in?

2557
02:07:57,900 --> 02:07:58,900
Because I looped you and all the experts.

2558
02:07:58,900 --> 02:07:59,900
Looped you in on what?

2559
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:00,900
Emails.

2560
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:01,900
How was that?

2561
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:02,900
That was email.

2562
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:04,900
I asked him if I could reuse his material.

2563
02:08:04,900 --> 02:08:06,900
I'm sorry, I thought you were bringing somebody new to the table.

2564
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:10,900
The other expert, the Raytheon engineer,

2565
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:14,900
he told you not to include him.

2566
02:08:14,900 --> 02:08:19,900
He said, I gave you permission to publish, to share any of our discussion.

2567
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:21,900
I now regret any discussion with him.

2568
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:26,900
I'm putting out, I believe that this is more important than the stigma.

2569
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:28,900
These guys are fighting a stigma.

2570
02:08:28,900 --> 02:08:32,900
So you think they're debunking me, but they just won't talk,

2571
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:34,900
and they won't go on the record?

2572
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:36,900
The expert in the world agrees with you.

2573
02:08:36,900 --> 02:08:38,900
I know you're eager for Aero to debunk this

2574
02:08:38,900 --> 02:08:41,900
because you thought they were doing lab experiments

2575
02:08:41,900 --> 02:08:43,900
that Kurt Patrick was talking about.

2576
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:46,900
It's been seven, how long has it been since this video came out?

2577
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:47,900
Almost a decade.

2578
02:08:47,900 --> 02:08:49,900
Actually, gosh, we're on a decade now.

2579
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:52,900
Well, Aero's only been working on it a couple of years, I guess.

2580
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:54,900
Yeah, you think they're very slow, very slow.

2581
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:55,900
Well, they did Aguadilla.

2582
02:08:55,900 --> 02:08:58,900
They're doing a whole, don't you want to show where they debunked?

2583
02:08:58,900 --> 02:09:00,900
It's an interesting thing, I see Aguadilla, like when you talk about experts.

2584
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:02,900
No, no, no, let's stay on Gimbal.

2585
02:09:02,900 --> 02:09:08,900
Well, just very, very quickly, I think Aguadilla has the SCU,

2586
02:09:08,900 --> 02:09:11,900
the Coalition for the Study of...

2587
02:09:11,900 --> 02:09:12,900
Yeah.

2588
02:09:12,900 --> 02:09:14,900
They did like a 200-page documentary

2589
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:16,900
with a bunch of different experts, people with PhDs.

2590
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:18,900
They think it's some kind of alien work.

2591
02:09:18,900 --> 02:09:21,900
But why do you think Aero hasn't, or anybody hasn't...

2592
02:09:21,900 --> 02:09:23,900
Why has nobody backed you on your theory?

2593
02:09:23,900 --> 02:09:26,900
Well, they backed me on Aguadilla, and they backed me on the triangles.

2594
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:27,900
On Gimbal.

2595
02:09:27,900 --> 02:09:29,900
Because they haven't finished their analysis yet.

2596
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:32,900
Okay, I think that's a stretch.

2597
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:37,900
Why is there no academic literature that supports your glare theory?

2598
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:39,900
It's all blooming, defraction, and saturation.

2599
02:09:39,900 --> 02:09:40,900
Because it's not a very common thing.

2600
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:42,900
It's not something that happens all the time.

2601
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:45,900
If it was common, we wouldn't be having this discussion.

2602
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:47,900
This is an anomalous event.

2603
02:09:47,900 --> 02:09:49,900
This is something that happened that was weird,

2604
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:51,900
and the pilots didn't recognize it,

2605
02:09:51,900 --> 02:09:53,900
because it isn't something that happens every day.

2606
02:09:53,900 --> 02:09:55,900
There's an active-duty wisdom.

2607
02:09:55,900 --> 02:09:57,900
Based on them being a narrow field of Zoom,

2608
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:59,900
I sent this to you years ago,

2609
02:09:59,900 --> 02:10:01,900
narrow field of view Zoom, too.

2610
02:10:01,900 --> 02:10:03,900
He uses this system daily, and the fidelity of the picture,

2611
02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:05,900
they're probably less than 10 miles away.

2612
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:12,900
He uses the system every day.

2613
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:14,900
Life and death, right? They rely on the system.

2614
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:16,900
Yeah, but I don't really see how that can be determined

2615
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:18,900
from what we're seeing on screen.

2616
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:22,900
If you point the camera at the sun,

2617
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:24,900
it doesn't look like it's 10 miles away.

2618
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:26,900
One other fact I just want to introduce

2619
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:28,900
is that possibly this was also

2620
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:30,900
involved in the formation of other...

2621
02:10:30,900 --> 02:10:32,900
Correct. That's the fleet.

2622
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:34,900
And Ryan has done it, to his credit,

2623
02:10:34,900 --> 02:10:36,900
and we can maybe throw this up,

2624
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:38,900
I put it in the slides, but he's recreated this,

2625
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:41,900
and it's kind of a V-shaped formation.

2626
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:45,900
When the object does this very bizarre

2627
02:10:45,900 --> 02:10:47,900
kind of reversal of direction with no radius of turn,

2628
02:10:47,900 --> 02:10:49,900
they kind of do a jumbled turn,

2629
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:51,900
and then they proceed and go in the same direction

2630
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:53,900
as that object.

2631
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:55,900
They're all moving together in concert, basically,

2632
02:10:55,900 --> 02:10:59,900
is the recollection from the top-down view

2633
02:10:59,900 --> 02:11:01,900
from the radar.

2634
02:11:01,900 --> 02:11:03,900
His recreation isn't actually that good

2635
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:05,900
because it doesn't incorporate the rotation of the plane.

2636
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:07,900
That's fair.

2637
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:09,900
But what is your theory now?

2638
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:11,900
Now that the glare on the glass has basically been ruled out,

2639
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:13,900
what is your theory?

2640
02:11:13,900 --> 02:11:15,900
I think what we see here is some kind of optical effect

2641
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:17,900
that is rotating because of the de-rotation mechanism.

2642
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:19,900
And what evidence do you have for that?

2643
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:21,900
Well, for a start, there's the bands of light and dark

2644
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:23,900
that rotate in the background.

2645
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:25,900
Does the fact that the rotation exactly matches

2646
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:27,900
the needed rotation?

2647
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:29,900
So, no, it doesn't, right?

2648
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:31,900
You don't know what the pitch angle of that jet is.

2649
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:33,900
You picked a random number.

2650
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:35,900
It was not a random number. It was 3.6,

2651
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:37,900
which is exactly what the F-16's...

2652
02:11:37,900 --> 02:11:39,900
F-18.

2653
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:41,900
So they were in a matching Durn's profile.

2654
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:43,900
You were in a max range profile.

2655
02:11:43,900 --> 02:11:45,900
You're already wrong right there.

2656
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:47,900
Well, if you change that, it doesn't really change it very much.

2657
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:49,900
It just slightly offsets the curve.

2658
02:11:49,900 --> 02:11:51,900
Not right now, obviously.

2659
02:11:53,900 --> 02:11:55,900
Bottom line is I think

2660
02:11:55,900 --> 02:11:57,900
we need to hear from, hopefully,

2661
02:11:57,900 --> 02:11:59,900
from the backseat.

2662
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:01,900
You can see by looking at it that there's an optical effect.

2663
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:03,900
If you actually look at this thing

2664
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:05,900
and you see the light and dark rotation

2665
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:07,900
in the background, I know you said you've

2666
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:09,900
thrown some anonymous exposure

2667
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:11,900
that won't go on record.

2668
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:13,900
I sent the email to you.

2669
02:12:13,900 --> 02:12:15,900
Yeah, but if it's not going on record, it's kind of useless.

2670
02:12:15,900 --> 02:12:17,900
Okay.

2671
02:12:17,900 --> 02:12:19,900
So you've brought no experts to me.

2672
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:21,900
I've brought all the experts to you.

2673
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:23,900
That's great, but if you bring some experts to the public,

2674
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:25,900
it's not that useful just bringing them to me.

2675
02:12:25,900 --> 02:12:27,900
Unfortunately, the stigma that you promote

2676
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:29,900
is a big part of why they come out.

2677
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:31,900
I encourage them to come forward.

2678
02:12:31,900 --> 02:12:33,900
Come forward and I won't laugh at you.

2679
02:12:33,900 --> 02:12:35,900
There are lots of scientists who aren't

2680
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:37,900
afraid of doing

2681
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:39,900
proper analysis.

2682
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:41,900
I'll kind of strawman

2683
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:43,900
both the arguments here. Please do.

2684
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:45,900
I think on

2685
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:47,900
Merrick, your side, I think we need

2686
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:49,900
more of these people to come out to

2687
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:51,900
gain confidence on this, both on the expert

2688
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:53,900
side and then the

2689
02:12:53,900 --> 02:12:55,900
operators of these FLIR systems

2690
02:12:55,900 --> 02:12:57,900
and the pilots themselves.

2691
02:12:57,900 --> 02:12:59,900
Then on your side,

2692
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:01,900
Mick, I think

2693
02:13:01,900 --> 02:13:03,900
you probably have to take

2694
02:13:03,900 --> 02:13:05,900
prima facie

2695
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:07,900
this

2696
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:09,900
operator of this FLIR system, this

2697
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:11,900
pilot who is

2698
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:13,900
saying, whoa, this is crazy.

2699
02:13:13,900 --> 02:13:15,900
The idea

2700
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:17,900
that it's an F-18

2701
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:19,900
and that this is happening around

2702
02:13:19,900 --> 02:13:21,900
the GOFAST as well

2703
02:13:21,900 --> 02:13:23,900
and that it's in this bizarre formation

2704
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:25,900
and if you turn the

2705
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:27,900
camera and you're the person turning the camera,

2706
02:13:27,900 --> 02:13:29,900
you're actually operating the system,

2707
02:13:29,900 --> 02:13:31,900
there's no reason to freak out. There's no reason

2708
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:33,900
to attach that audio.

2709
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:35,900
It turns automatically.

2710
02:13:35,900 --> 02:13:37,900
Sure, but if you're highly aware

2711
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:39,900
of the camera turning.

2712
02:13:39,900 --> 02:13:41,900
David Fravor discussed this

2713
02:13:41,900 --> 02:13:43,900
hypothesis and he said the camera doesn't turn,

2714
02:13:43,900 --> 02:13:45,900
which is just my player on.

2715
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:47,900
From his perspective, the camera appears

2716
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:49,900
not to turn. The camera turns when it tracks

2717
02:13:49,900 --> 02:13:51,900
something going underneath the plane.

2718
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:53,900
You're saying David Fravor isn't

2719
02:13:53,900 --> 02:13:55,900
familiar with basic

2720
02:13:55,900 --> 02:13:57,900
locking and tracking?

2721
02:13:57,900 --> 02:13:59,900
He's familiar with using it.

2722
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:01,900
So he knows

2723
02:14:01,900 --> 02:14:03,900
what does the press and what

2724
02:14:03,900 --> 02:14:05,900
appears on screen and what it actually means in terms of

2725
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:07,900
what's in the air, but he doesn't know what's actually

2726
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:09,900
going on in the optics, what the lenses do,

2727
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:11,900
what the mirrors do, and how it rotates.

2728
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:13,900
So you think it's like,

2729
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:15,900
and then that same guy

2730
02:14:15,900 --> 02:14:17,900
who presumably, I mean we have to figure

2731
02:14:17,900 --> 02:14:19,900
out who he is, but has like

2732
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:21,900
some history

2733
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:23,900
doing this stuff. Right.

2734
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:25,900
After he sees this, he doesn't

2735
02:14:25,900 --> 02:14:27,900
see anything like it.

2736
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:29,900
Nobody's seen anything like this.

2737
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:31,900
That's why we've got this video, it's this once

2738
02:14:31,900 --> 02:14:33,900
in a 20 year thing that happened.

2739
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:35,900
When the pilot says

2740
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:37,900
they won the lottery of the

2741
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:39,900
jargon here, and it just happened to

2742
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:41,900
occur right amid all these

2743
02:14:41,900 --> 02:14:43,900
encounters, when the pilot

2744
02:14:43,900 --> 02:14:45,900
says that is the LNS,

2745
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:47,900
and I'll just explain, the LNS is the launch

2746
02:14:47,900 --> 02:14:49,900
and steering, which is the selected radar target,

2747
02:14:49,900 --> 02:14:51,900
what does that mean to you?

2748
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:53,900
So let me just explain,

2749
02:14:53,900 --> 02:14:55,900
the WISO says, hey, is that

2750
02:14:55,900 --> 02:14:57,900
our radar target on our FLIR,

2751
02:14:57,900 --> 02:14:59,900
on the camera? And the pilot says, yes,

2752
02:14:59,900 --> 02:15:01,900
that is our selected radar target,

2753
02:15:01,900 --> 02:15:03,900
which is six to eight miles away.

2754
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:05,900
What do you think the pilot meant when he says

2755
02:15:05,900 --> 02:15:07,900
that is, and what do you think he meant

2756
02:15:07,900 --> 02:15:09,900
when they briefed Congress

2757
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:11,900
and says we knew it was not a false hit,

2758
02:15:11,900 --> 02:15:13,900
we knew that we had a

2759
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:15,900
stable radar lock, a stable

2760
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:17,900
track file on it,

2761
02:15:17,900 --> 02:15:19,900
when they mentioned closest

2762
02:15:19,900 --> 02:15:21,900
point of intercept.

2763
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:23,900
You know what the Jehemic system is,

2764
02:15:23,900 --> 02:15:25,900
right? It places, how does

2765
02:15:25,900 --> 02:15:27,900
your theory square with all the technology?

2766
02:15:27,900 --> 02:15:29,900
Let me just quickly,

2767
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:31,900
it's basically like an Apple

2768
02:15:31,900 --> 02:15:33,900
Vision kind of

2769
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:35,900
thing, the visor that puts

2770
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:37,900
all the data, yeah, it pumps all

2771
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:39,900
the data and you'll get a little box like

2772
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:41,900
where there's a target somewhere. Ryan talked about it

2773
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:43,900
in your... So how do

2774
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:45,900
you square, like, let's just start with the LNS, right?

2775
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:47,900
The pilot says

2776
02:15:47,900 --> 02:15:49,900
that is, yes, that's our radar target.

2777
02:15:49,900 --> 02:15:51,900
It's actually a bit instinctive to what he actually says, but what we see

2778
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:53,900
on the screen here

2779
02:15:53,900 --> 02:15:55,900
is an optical

2780
02:15:55,900 --> 02:15:57,900
track. It's actually tracking it using

2781
02:15:57,900 --> 02:15:59,900
the contrast

2782
02:15:59,900 --> 02:16:01,900
on the screen. So

2783
02:16:01,900 --> 02:16:03,900
what you might be referring to is something that's on the SI

2784
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:05,900
page,

2785
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:07,900
which would be like the nearer

2786
02:16:07,900 --> 02:16:09,900
radar target. No, the

2787
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:11,900
WIZO asks, hey, is that thing that we're looking on

2788
02:16:11,900 --> 02:16:13,900
the FLIR, the selected...

2789
02:16:13,900 --> 02:16:15,900
He said, is that...

2790
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:17,900
I'm trying to remember what he said.

2791
02:16:17,900 --> 02:16:19,900
Is that LNS, dude?

2792
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:21,900
And the other guy said, yeah, that is LNS.

2793
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:23,900
We don't know what he's referring to,

2794
02:16:23,900 --> 02:16:25,900
it could be like... The selected radar target.

2795
02:16:25,900 --> 02:16:27,900
That's what the LNS is.

2796
02:16:27,900 --> 02:16:29,900
Well, yes, but like, is that that?

2797
02:16:29,900 --> 02:16:31,900
Or is that a different target?

2798
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:33,900
Because they also saw this fleet of things.

2799
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:35,900
So there just happened to be a distant jet

2800
02:16:35,900 --> 02:16:37,900
exactly where

2801
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:39,900
the close thing is? Is that what you're saying?

2802
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:41,900
Behind us somewhere. Really?

2803
02:16:41,900 --> 02:16:43,900
So it just happened... Like, this is the odds of this?

2804
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:45,900
So you're saying that they're referring to another...

2805
02:16:45,900 --> 02:16:47,900
You're very familiar with this theory of mine, Mark.

2806
02:16:47,900 --> 02:16:49,900
I think this is... Wait, so

2807
02:16:49,900 --> 02:16:51,900
let me just... Playing this with the crowd here a little.

2808
02:16:51,900 --> 02:16:53,900
Hold on, hold on. So you... They have

2809
02:16:53,900 --> 02:16:55,900
this radar target, right? It's six miles away.

2810
02:16:55,900 --> 02:16:57,900
And directly behind it,

2811
02:16:57,900 --> 02:16:59,900
is some other jet

2812
02:16:59,900 --> 02:17:01,900
in doing...

2813
02:17:01,900 --> 02:17:03,900
Like, showing

2814
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:05,900
its heat

2815
02:17:05,900 --> 02:17:07,900
engine in a way that's

2816
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:09,900
never been seen before in a malfunctioning

2817
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:11,900
pod in a... What else

2818
02:17:11,900 --> 02:17:13,900
we have? A malfunctioning of all

2819
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:15,900
the electronic identification systems.

2820
02:17:15,900 --> 02:17:17,900
It's just cascading

2821
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:19,900
failures. I can't wrap my head... I hope I'm

2822
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:21,900
getting through to people, but it's just...

2823
02:17:21,900 --> 02:17:23,900
It is pretty wild to me.

2824
02:17:23,900 --> 02:17:25,900
Yeah, it seems unlikely, right?

2825
02:17:25,900 --> 02:17:27,900
It's perfectly lined up.

2826
02:17:27,900 --> 02:17:29,900
You would just say, what, like, law of large numbers?

2827
02:17:29,900 --> 02:17:31,900
And we've never... The AT

2828
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:33,900
flare does not rotate in steps. If it's malfunctioning, maybe

2829
02:17:33,900 --> 02:17:35,900
I don't... I just find that hard to believe.

2830
02:17:35,900 --> 02:17:37,900
By the way, the patent, literally

2831
02:17:37,900 --> 02:17:39,900
the patent, which you looked up,

2832
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:41,900
the patent... There's a sentence in there that explicitly

2833
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:43,900
we can pull it up, explicitly

2834
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:45,900
disproves your theory.

2835
02:17:45,900 --> 02:17:47,900
Why is the patent explicitly...

2836
02:17:47,900 --> 02:17:49,900
Well, we can go... I know we have to wrap up.

2837
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:51,900
No, no, we're good. We have until four now.

2838
02:17:51,900 --> 02:17:53,900
Oh, wow. Geez. Okay. I don't know

2839
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:55,900
if I can...

2840
02:17:55,900 --> 02:17:57,900
You tell me where the patent is.

2841
02:17:57,900 --> 02:17:59,900
There's a lot of things at the very end.

2842
02:17:59,900 --> 02:18:01,900
It says, for example,

2843
02:18:01,900 --> 02:18:03,900
that it will avoid using

2844
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:05,900
the roll in a fashion. So this is super

2845
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:07,900
jargony. Mick knows what I mean.

2846
02:18:07,900 --> 02:18:09,900
This, on its face,

2847
02:18:09,900 --> 02:18:11,900
disproves your theory.

2848
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:13,900
Spacely saying that it avoids

2849
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:15,900
rotation. What are the

2850
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:17,900
three words before that paragraph?

2851
02:18:17,900 --> 02:18:19,900
In some embodiments. That is,

2852
02:18:19,900 --> 02:18:21,900
any patent expert will know that is in

2853
02:18:21,900 --> 02:18:23,900
every single patent, that language.

2854
02:18:23,900 --> 02:18:25,900
That is not unique.

2855
02:18:25,900 --> 02:18:27,900
For example,

2856
02:18:27,900 --> 02:18:29,900
these patents are very broad.

2857
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:31,900
Like in some...

2858
02:18:31,900 --> 02:18:33,900
We have to describe to the audience

2859
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:35,900
what the patent is.

2860
02:18:35,900 --> 02:18:37,900
So this explicitly... So Mick says,

2861
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:39,900
this is so... It hurts

2862
02:18:39,900 --> 02:18:41,900
for you. It's so complex.

2863
02:18:41,900 --> 02:18:43,900
He says that...

2864
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:45,900
So normally the pod will just do a nice

2865
02:18:45,900 --> 02:18:47,900
slow rotation like this to find out.

2866
02:18:47,900 --> 02:18:49,900
We'll put the video up. We modeled it out.

2867
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:51,900
And it's just like this super chill...

2868
02:18:51,900 --> 02:18:53,900
It doesn't do this for rotation.

2869
02:18:53,900 --> 02:18:55,900
Because you can remember in the Gimbal video

2870
02:18:55,900 --> 02:18:57,900
it does one, two, three, four.

2871
02:18:57,900 --> 02:18:59,900
Normally, the patent

2872
02:18:59,900 --> 02:19:01,900
says it would just do a very simple,

2873
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:03,900
very gradual, nothing aggressive.

2874
02:19:03,900 --> 02:19:05,900
It doesn't say that. Absolutely.

2875
02:19:05,900 --> 02:19:07,900
So it says in some

2876
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:09,900
embodiments it only uses the two axes

2877
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:11,900
which would give that smooth rotation.

2878
02:19:11,900 --> 02:19:13,900
Correct. But it doesn't say that the app

2879
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:15,900
that was used that day is that particular

2880
02:19:15,900 --> 02:19:17,900
embodiment.

2881
02:19:17,900 --> 02:19:19,900
And also this was a patent

2882
02:19:19,900 --> 02:19:21,900
from, I believe, 2006.

2883
02:19:23,900 --> 02:19:25,900
And we're talking about the Gimbal video

2884
02:19:25,900 --> 02:19:27,900
which was filmed several years later. And as you know

2885
02:19:27,900 --> 02:19:29,900
from talking to Mr. Snow,

2886
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:31,900
these systems change quite a lot

2887
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:33,900
over time. But when they get smoother, not

2888
02:19:33,900 --> 02:19:35,900
less. Correct. Not more. Mechanically

2889
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:37,900
it makes no sense to do this crazy

2890
02:19:37,900 --> 02:19:39,900
stopping though. The image is what you want to be smooth.

2891
02:19:39,900 --> 02:19:41,900
And if you notice in the Gimbal video, it actually

2892
02:19:41,900 --> 02:19:43,900
kind of like loses lock, weirdly,

2893
02:19:43,900 --> 02:19:45,900
quite a lot throughout the thing, even though it's not

2894
02:19:45,900 --> 02:19:47,900
moving around very much. There's little Gimbal rotations

2895
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:49,900
and it moves off to the side. You don't see

2896
02:19:49,900 --> 02:19:51,900
that in the GoFast. But the rotation

2897
02:19:51,900 --> 02:19:53,900
wouldn't be more jagged,

2898
02:19:53,900 --> 02:19:55,900
right? It wouldn't be more like locked.

2899
02:19:55,900 --> 02:19:57,900
There's two things they have to balance. There's the actual mechanics

2900
02:19:57,900 --> 02:19:59,900
of the part itself and then what

2901
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:01,900
the pilot sees. And it wants to make the

2902
02:20:01,900 --> 02:20:03,900
tracking as accurate as possible first.

2903
02:20:03,900 --> 02:20:05,900
Is there a trade-off there? Introducing steps is

2904
02:20:05,900 --> 02:20:07,900
the worst part because you're like starting,

2905
02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:09,900
stopping, starting, stopping. Well not if you have a very

2906
02:20:09,900 --> 02:20:11,900
agile mirror system in there that can

2907
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:13,900
counter those. So we're

2908
02:20:13,900 --> 02:20:15,900
purely in that speculation. That's

2909
02:20:15,900 --> 02:20:17,900
what we actually have. And that explicitly

2910
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:19,900
disproves your theory. Well, they also have

2911
02:20:19,900 --> 02:20:21,900
the description of the mirror systems in there with

2912
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:23,900
plus or minus three degrees of

2913
02:20:23,900 --> 02:20:25,900
source, which is about

2914
02:20:25,900 --> 02:20:27,900
the same deviation from the way we get with

2915
02:20:27,900 --> 02:20:29,900
the steps.

2916
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:31,900
Sorry, I don't

2917
02:20:31,900 --> 02:20:33,900
follow. The point is the pattern. We know

2918
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:35,900
that we don't have to point directly or something.

2919
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:37,900
We can use the mirrors to steer, the extra mirrors.

2920
02:20:37,900 --> 02:20:39,900
No.

2921
02:20:39,900 --> 02:20:41,900
It just doesn't work that way. There's no

2922
02:20:41,900 --> 02:20:43,900
evidence of that. You need evidence. There's no evidence

2923
02:20:43,900 --> 02:20:45,900
of glare. There's no evidence of rotating

2924
02:20:45,900 --> 02:20:47,900
glare. There's no evidence of any

2925
02:20:47,900 --> 02:20:49,900
of this. Well, we just gone over all the

2926
02:20:49,900 --> 02:20:51,900
evidence on it. You can see it on the screen

2927
02:20:51,900 --> 02:20:53,900
that we have an optical effect.

2928
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:55,900
You can't use

2929
02:20:55,900 --> 02:20:57,900
the gimbal video to prove your

2930
02:20:57,900 --> 02:20:59,900
theory for the gimbal video. That's impossible.

2931
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:01,900
I'm just using it to

2932
02:21:01,900 --> 02:21:03,900
show that there's actually some kind of optical effects

2933
02:21:03,900 --> 02:21:05,900
going on. I hope we can maybe, if you wanted

2934
02:21:05,900 --> 02:21:07,900
to quickly look at some imagery of what

2935
02:21:07,900 --> 02:21:09,900
the camera, how it actually

2936
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:11,900
records jet engine exhaust.

2937
02:21:11,900 --> 02:21:13,900
So where are we going?

2938
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:15,900
While you're doing that,

2939
02:21:15,900 --> 02:21:17,900
I would like to encourage anybody out there

2940
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:19,900
who understands this

2941
02:21:19,900 --> 02:21:21,900
to weigh in. Because we need more people

2942
02:21:21,900 --> 02:21:23,900
looking into this.

2943
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:25,900
That's a big takeaway.

2944
02:21:25,900 --> 02:21:27,900
No, we need more analysis,

2945
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:29,900
more credible eyes, people with rigorous

2946
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:31,900
backgrounds, experts. We need experts to actually

2947
02:21:31,900 --> 02:21:33,900
speak on the record. Agreed.

2948
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:35,900
And also people who know, because a lot of this stuff is just

2949
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:37,900
the systems and how they work. We're

2950
02:21:37,900 --> 02:21:39,900
debating these obscure

2951
02:21:39,900 --> 02:21:41,900
raping on patents. This is absurd.

2952
02:21:41,900 --> 02:21:43,900
I know.

2953
02:21:43,900 --> 02:21:45,900
We need

2954
02:21:45,900 --> 02:21:47,900
something that's 30 miles away.

2955
02:21:47,900 --> 02:21:49,900
By the way, to the extent you're not compromising

2956
02:21:49,900 --> 02:21:51,900
American national security,

2957
02:21:51,900 --> 02:21:53,900
if you are not, I think it's your patriotic

2958
02:21:53,900 --> 02:21:55,900
duty to come out.

2959
02:21:55,900 --> 02:21:57,900
If you are, then maybe

2960
02:21:57,900 --> 02:21:59,900
stay where you are.

2961
02:21:59,900 --> 02:22:01,900
Varying distances,

2962
02:22:01,900 --> 02:22:03,900
the engine exhaust

2963
02:22:03,900 --> 02:22:05,900
gets bigger and bigger. No, it doesn't.

2964
02:22:05,900 --> 02:22:07,900
In fact, it gets smaller.

2965
02:22:07,900 --> 02:22:09,900
And I have a video. I can show it.

2966
02:22:09,900 --> 02:22:11,900
So this is from the same video.

2967
02:22:11,900 --> 02:22:13,900
And this is a lot further

2968
02:22:13,900 --> 02:22:15,900
away at the end of it. And it gets smaller.

2969
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:17,900
So Raytheon,

2970
02:22:17,900 --> 02:22:19,900
I believe it looks like

2971
02:22:19,900 --> 02:22:21,900
they have some anti-blooming effects on there.

2972
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:23,900
So that is the opposite

2973
02:22:23,900 --> 02:22:25,900
of what you are suggesting.

2974
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:27,900
And if you

2975
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:29,900
go down one more.

2976
02:22:29,900 --> 02:22:31,900
So this is the glare to wing size.

2977
02:22:31,900 --> 02:22:33,900
I'm sorry.

2978
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:35,900
That's exhaust. Don't use glare.

2979
02:22:35,900 --> 02:22:37,900
Glare doesn't exist.

2980
02:22:37,900 --> 02:22:39,900
I'm telling you, there's a lot of papers

2981
02:22:39,900 --> 02:22:41,900
about blooming. If you go down to that one where your mouse

2982
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:43,900
is right there, compare that

2983
02:22:43,900 --> 02:22:45,900
to mixed theory. That's mixed theory right there.

2984
02:22:45,900 --> 02:22:47,900
Yes, a point light source

2985
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:49,900
will create a specific

2986
02:22:49,900 --> 02:22:51,900
size on the sensor. So it doesn't really matter

2987
02:22:51,900 --> 02:22:53,900
how big it is. Your speculator.

2988
02:22:53,900 --> 02:22:55,900
What is the light source though?

2989
02:22:55,900 --> 02:22:57,900
It's not light.

2990
02:22:57,900 --> 02:22:59,900
It's the heat of the engines.

2991
02:22:59,900 --> 02:23:01,900
This is a thermal camera. So we're looking at

2992
02:23:01,900 --> 02:23:03,900
the camera of this jet.

2993
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:05,900
Essentially, it's a very, very bright,

2994
02:23:05,900 --> 02:23:07,900
brilliant light source. And the

2995
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:09,900
camera for some reason has created this

2996
02:23:09,900 --> 02:23:11,900
glare, this optical effect.

2997
02:23:11,900 --> 02:23:13,900
There's perhaps sensor blooming.

2998
02:23:13,900 --> 02:23:15,900
Probably not though.

2999
02:23:15,900 --> 02:23:17,900
Look, I'm just a bystander.

3000
02:23:17,900 --> 02:23:19,900
I'm open to both of you guys being right. I think

3001
02:23:19,900 --> 02:23:21,900
it's kind of

3002
02:23:21,900 --> 02:23:23,900
scary from an American national

3003
02:23:23,900 --> 02:23:25,900
security perspective, if you're right.

3004
02:23:25,900 --> 02:23:27,900
Because that's just so bad.

3005
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:29,900
It's like this heat source. It's fuzzy.

3006
02:23:29,900 --> 02:23:31,900
It doesn't happen every day though.

3007
02:23:31,900 --> 02:23:33,900
It doesn't happen every day. It's not like

3008
02:23:33,900 --> 02:23:35,900
this is going on all the time.

3009
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:37,900
If that's an F-18

3010
02:23:37,900 --> 02:23:39,900
at a base that's frequently

3011
02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:41,900
flying F-18, it's like that's

3012
02:23:41,900 --> 02:23:43,900
pretty bad detection.

3013
02:23:43,900 --> 02:23:45,900
Arrow thinks it's a glare.

3014
02:23:45,900 --> 02:23:47,900
Arrow thinks it's a glare? That's not true.

3015
02:23:47,900 --> 02:23:49,900
Kirkpatrick? No.

3016
02:23:49,900 --> 02:23:51,900
Kirkpatrick thought Gimbal was filmed during

3017
02:23:51,900 --> 02:23:53,900
the daytime. Yeah, but

3018
02:23:53,900 --> 02:23:55,900
what they're actually working on is

3019
02:23:55,900 --> 02:23:57,900
the assumption that this is some kind of glare.

3020
02:23:57,900 --> 02:23:59,900
An optical effect.

3021
02:23:59,900 --> 02:24:01,900
I don't think there's any evidence of that.

3022
02:24:01,900 --> 02:24:03,900
Well, we'll see.

3023
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:05,900
You said that right before this hearing.

3024
02:24:05,900 --> 02:24:07,900
You're very

3025
02:24:07,900 --> 02:24:09,900
excited. Oh, we can't wait to see what Arrow has to say about

3026
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:11,900
this. The hearing came and went.

3027
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:13,900
The game is GoFast and Aguadilla, which was

3028
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:15,900
good. Well, now they're

3029
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:17,900
in a tough spot with GoFast,

3030
02:24:17,900 --> 02:24:19,900
as we said, because Aircrew is going to

3031
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:21,900
contradict them.

3032
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:23,900
Yeah, well, then they'll take that new

3033
02:24:23,900 --> 02:24:25,900
information into their analysis.

3034
02:24:25,900 --> 02:24:27,900
That is just absurd to me based

3035
02:24:27,900 --> 02:24:29,900
on the empirical evidence, right?

3036
02:24:29,900 --> 02:24:31,900
That shape, if you go up...

3037
02:24:31,900 --> 02:24:33,900
That matches the Chilean case.

3038
02:24:33,900 --> 02:24:35,900
Almost exactly the same size.

3039
02:24:35,900 --> 02:24:37,900
First of all, that's blooming, right?

3040
02:24:37,900 --> 02:24:39,900
Can you explain what blooming is?

3041
02:24:39,900 --> 02:24:41,900
Yeah, so it's, again, when

3042
02:24:41,900 --> 02:24:43,900
a sensor gets hit with

3043
02:24:43,900 --> 02:24:45,900
a pixel gets hit with too much energy,

3044
02:24:45,900 --> 02:24:47,900
that it'll spill over to

3045
02:24:47,900 --> 02:24:49,900
other pixels.

3046
02:24:49,900 --> 02:24:51,900
And that's what we see in the Chilean case.

3047
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:53,900
That is an apple to orange.

3048
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:55,900
Can you explain what glare is?

3049
02:24:55,900 --> 02:24:57,900
It's relevant to this conversation.

3050
02:24:57,900 --> 02:24:59,900
Oh, but you said, like, it doesn't exist.

3051
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:01,900
Sorry, in infrared.

3052
02:25:01,900 --> 02:25:03,900
Why not?

3053
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:05,900
I'm going off of the people who

3054
02:25:05,900 --> 02:25:07,900
are experts on this.

3055
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:09,900
Why do they talk about a point spread function

3056
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:11,900
if glare doesn't exist in infrared?

3057
02:25:11,900 --> 02:25:13,900
I'm pretty sure he was talking about

3058
02:25:13,900 --> 02:25:15,900
your FLIR 1 example.

3059
02:25:15,900 --> 02:25:17,900
What point spread function?

3060
02:25:17,900 --> 02:25:19,900
Point spread function is

3061
02:25:19,900 --> 02:25:21,900
a mathematical model of how

3062
02:25:21,900 --> 02:25:23,900
light spreads from a point.

3063
02:25:23,900 --> 02:25:25,900
So any point on the thing, this is a photo

3064
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:27,900
of the scene here. So in what context are they bringing up

3065
02:25:27,900 --> 02:25:29,900
the point spread function?

3066
02:25:29,900 --> 02:25:31,900
In the context of glare, essentially.

3067
02:25:31,900 --> 02:25:33,900
It was a little

3068
02:25:33,900 --> 02:25:35,900
confusing as a paragraph, and it was something I wanted to talk to you

3069
02:25:35,900 --> 02:25:37,900
more, but you never responded to my emails.

3070
02:25:37,900 --> 02:25:39,900
I emailed them this morning, actually.

3071
02:25:39,900 --> 02:25:41,900
The second expert.

3072
02:25:41,900 --> 02:25:43,900
If you,

3073
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:45,900
usually the point spread function is kind of like

3074
02:25:45,900 --> 02:25:47,900
a curve that goes

3075
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:49,900
like this, a very, very sharp curve

3076
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:51,900
like that. And that's how

3077
02:25:51,900 --> 02:25:53,900
light spreads from

3078
02:25:53,900 --> 02:25:55,900
any pixel

3079
02:25:55,900 --> 02:25:57,900
on the entire

3080
02:25:57,900 --> 02:25:59,900
scene, spreads according to

3081
02:25:59,900 --> 02:26:01,900
this function.

3082
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:03,900
So for things that are pretty dim,

3083
02:26:03,900 --> 02:26:05,900
like most of the stuff in this

3084
02:26:05,900 --> 02:26:07,900
room, you get a very, very sharp

3085
02:26:07,900 --> 02:26:09,900
pixel, because the stuff that's to the

3086
02:26:09,900 --> 02:26:11,900
side is very, very low level.

3087
02:26:11,900 --> 02:26:13,900
But around a bright light like

3088
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:15,900
this, everything is kind of boosted up.

3089
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:17,900
So you actually start to get the effects

3090
02:26:17,900 --> 02:26:19,900
of the edges of this point spread

3091
02:26:19,900 --> 02:26:21,900
function. And you can use this

3092
02:26:21,900 --> 02:26:23,900
to basically model optical effects, and

3093
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:25,900
they use it to model glare

3094
02:26:25,900 --> 02:26:27,900
in various optical systems.

3095
02:26:27,900 --> 02:26:29,900
And you would have a

3096
02:26:29,900 --> 02:26:31,900
point spread function for an

3097
02:26:31,900 --> 02:26:33,900
infrared thing. There's simply no way of not

3098
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:35,900
having it, because you're going to

3099
02:26:35,900 --> 02:26:37,900
get some scatter from imperfections in the mirrors,

3100
02:26:37,900 --> 02:26:39,900
possibly in the lenses.

3101
02:26:39,900 --> 02:26:41,900
And you can also incorporate that

3102
02:26:41,900 --> 02:26:43,900
into the

3103
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:45,900
sensor blooming as well. This is called, I think,

3104
02:26:45,900 --> 02:26:47,900
optical transfer

3105
02:26:47,900 --> 02:26:49,900
function is the entire thing.

3106
02:26:49,900 --> 02:26:51,900
It's point spread plus the

3107
02:26:51,900 --> 02:26:53,900
sensor spread as well.

3108
02:26:53,900 --> 02:26:55,900
And these are details that I think

3109
02:26:55,900 --> 02:26:57,900
experts should be able to weigh in. Absolutely.

3110
02:26:57,900 --> 02:26:59,900
I'm a little skeptical, Mick, because you

3111
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:01,900
spent years, you went on CNN with your little

3112
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:03,900
glass, right? That's the glare

3113
02:27:03,900 --> 02:27:05,900
on the glass that was disproven, what, two

3114
02:27:05,900 --> 02:27:07,900
months ago, three months ago?

3115
02:27:07,900 --> 02:27:09,900
We've got you

3116
02:27:09,900 --> 02:27:11,900
saying, oh, well, if it's not, I got you here.

3117
02:27:11,900 --> 02:27:13,900
Briefly, if the glare effect is indeed

3118
02:27:13,900 --> 02:27:15,900
all in the sensor, then you shift here to another.

3119
02:27:15,900 --> 02:27:17,900
It's showing that if part of the camera

3120
02:27:17,900 --> 02:27:19,900
rotates, or if the camera itself rotates,

3121
02:27:19,900 --> 02:27:21,900
then it rotates. That was the easiest way of demonstrating.

3122
02:27:21,900 --> 02:27:23,900
Since then, I've been doing it by rotating

3123
02:27:23,900 --> 02:27:25,900
a camera, like you can actually

3124
02:27:25,900 --> 02:27:27,900
hold two cameras up and rotate them. So basically what you've been saying for seven years

3125
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:29,900
is wrong. No, no.

3126
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:31,900
It's improved. No,

3127
02:27:31,900 --> 02:27:33,900
no, no. The glare on the glass

3128
02:27:33,900 --> 02:27:35,900
has been disproven, which you've been

3129
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:37,900
viewing on CNN. Well, according to you, it's been

3130
02:27:37,900 --> 02:27:39,900
disproven, but I don't think it has been

3131
02:27:39,900 --> 02:27:41,900
disproven. How do you reconcile

3132
02:27:41,900 --> 02:27:43,900
this with the glare on the glass?

3133
02:27:43,900 --> 02:27:45,900
According to Yannick, your co-author

3134
02:27:45,900 --> 02:27:47,900
on this paper, he quotes

3135
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:49,900
the expert.

3136
02:27:49,900 --> 02:27:51,900
The, quote, glare that Mick mentions

3137
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:53,900
is likely from boost filters,

3138
02:27:53,900 --> 02:27:55,900
high-pass filtering, edge shut. That's all internal.

3139
02:27:55,900 --> 02:27:57,900
That's not on the glass. Yeah, but

3140
02:27:57,900 --> 02:27:59,900
he's assuming that the glass is clean.

3141
02:27:59,900 --> 02:28:01,900
Oh, so we're back to the, so

3142
02:28:01,900 --> 02:28:03,900
at one point, I think it's necessarily

3143
02:28:03,900 --> 02:28:05,900
something on the glass. At one point, Mick thought that

3144
02:28:05,900 --> 02:28:07,900
he, some source told him, or somebody apparently

3145
02:28:07,900 --> 02:28:09,900
told him that crew chiefs

3146
02:28:09,900 --> 02:28:11,900
in the military just wiped

3147
02:28:11,900 --> 02:28:13,900
the glass.

3148
02:28:13,900 --> 02:28:15,900
I've got video of that happening.

3149
02:28:15,900 --> 02:28:17,900
The guy just manhandling one of those

3150
02:28:17,900 --> 02:28:19,900
systems with his hands. And I'm sure it was

3151
02:28:19,900 --> 02:28:21,900
cleaned after because there's pretty darn good

3152
02:28:21,900 --> 02:28:23,900
maintenance on these, on these systems.

3153
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:25,900
As soon as they get up in the air, they're going to throw

3154
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:27,900
a cloud up their face. So your

3155
02:28:27,900 --> 02:28:29,900
theory at one point was like

3156
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:31,900
that some crew chief like

3157
02:28:31,900 --> 02:28:33,900
wiped a greasy sleeve on it, and that's what

3158
02:28:33,900 --> 02:28:35,900
gave us this. I've heard people say that. I mean,

3159
02:28:35,900 --> 02:28:37,900
I don't think that's what happened because

3160
02:28:37,900 --> 02:28:39,900
the glare on the glass thing would probably give

3161
02:28:39,900 --> 02:28:41,900
a less even

3162
02:28:41,900 --> 02:28:43,900
shape. I think it's probably more to do with the internal

3163
02:28:43,900 --> 02:28:45,900
optics. I've got a camera

3164
02:28:45,900 --> 02:28:47,900
that gives a very similar

3165
02:28:47,900 --> 02:28:49,900
shaped glare to that. So my little

3166
02:28:49,900 --> 02:28:51,900
helmet mounted camera. Maybe you can

3167
02:28:51,900 --> 02:28:53,900
recap. So you have a malfunctioning

3168
02:28:55,900 --> 02:28:57,900
mechanical malfunction. It has to be.

3169
02:28:57,900 --> 02:28:59,900
No, we don't know that for sure because

3170
02:28:59,900 --> 02:29:01,900
we don't know if there's an embodiment that doesn't have

3171
02:29:01,900 --> 02:29:03,900
smooth steps. There's zero evidence

3172
02:29:03,900 --> 02:29:05,900
for that. You have to provide evidence. You don't have

3173
02:29:05,900 --> 02:29:07,900
evidence either way, really. Absolutely.

3174
02:29:07,900 --> 02:29:09,900
There's tons of footage of

3175
02:29:09,900 --> 02:29:11,900
you know this. You once

3176
02:29:11,900 --> 02:29:13,900
used Top Gun Maverick as evidence.

3177
02:29:13,900 --> 02:29:15,900
I was joking. Oh, my God.

3178
02:29:15,900 --> 02:29:17,900
You realize I was joking, right? No, because

3179
02:29:17,900 --> 02:29:19,900
you seem very, very serious

3180
02:29:19,900 --> 02:29:21,900
at the time. It was on a tweet

3181
02:29:21,900 --> 02:29:23,900
for Crying Out Loud. There's tons of

3182
02:29:23,900 --> 02:29:25,900
There's tons of

3183
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:27,900
actual video evidence of how

3184
02:29:27,900 --> 02:29:29,900
these systems rotate, and it's a nice

3185
02:29:29,900 --> 02:29:31,900
gradual, simple

3186
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:33,900
You don't really see it from the outside

3187
02:29:33,900 --> 02:29:35,900
rotating. You can see it on the edges

3188
02:29:35,900 --> 02:29:37,900
tracking. I have a

3189
02:29:37,900 --> 02:29:39,900
two minute long video. Very nice, smooth.

3190
02:29:39,900 --> 02:29:41,900
Let's move on, but both of you guys can

3191
02:29:41,900 --> 02:29:43,900
follow up. You can follow up with the

3192
02:29:43,900 --> 02:29:45,900
smooth rotation. If you want to

3193
02:29:45,900 --> 02:29:47,900
follow up with any videos that show the jagged

3194
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:49,900
kind of locking rotation, that's cool too.

3195
02:29:49,900 --> 02:29:51,900
I just want to quickly reiterate how

3196
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:53,900
you're saying there's a distant jet right

3197
02:29:53,900 --> 02:29:55,900
literally exactly in the line of

3198
02:29:55,900 --> 02:29:57,900
sight. Roughly.

3199
02:29:57,900 --> 02:29:59,900
Okay. And then we have

3200
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:01,900
a malfunctioning

3201
02:30:01,900 --> 02:30:03,900
pod, and then you have

3202
02:30:03,900 --> 02:30:05,900
an artifact

3203
02:30:05,900 --> 02:30:07,900
that nobody's ever seen before and no expert

3204
02:30:07,900 --> 02:30:09,900
know about, and no aviator who's ever

3205
02:30:09,900 --> 02:30:11,900
And you're saying that it's like this

3206
02:30:11,900 --> 02:30:13,900
new advanced technology, possibly aliens. I'm only

3207
02:30:13,900 --> 02:30:15,900
saying it is

3208
02:30:15,900 --> 02:30:17,900
there's a spectacular match between

3209
02:30:17,900 --> 02:30:19,900
the eyewitness accounts

3210
02:30:19,900 --> 02:30:21,900
of that anomalous trajectory,

3211
02:30:21,900 --> 02:30:23,900
that direction reversal with no

3212
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:25,900
radius of turn, the rotation we see

3213
02:30:25,900 --> 02:30:27,900
in the video, and the flight path we

3214
02:30:27,900 --> 02:30:29,900
can reconstruct. I'll leave it at that.

3215
02:30:29,900 --> 02:30:31,900
As you say, you know, new advanced

3216
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:33,900
technology or possibly aliens,

3217
02:30:33,900 --> 02:30:35,900
Dr. Stephen Greer

3218
02:30:35,900 --> 02:30:37,900
is obviously an outspoken person

3219
02:30:37,900 --> 02:30:39,900
when it comes to the UFO issue.

3220
02:30:39,900 --> 02:30:41,900
Very polarizing figure

3221
02:30:41,900 --> 02:30:43,900
on the topic. He

3222
02:30:43,900 --> 02:30:45,900
will come out and say things like, oh, the

3223
02:30:45,900 --> 02:30:47,900
Nimitz stuff, you know, that's all

3224
02:30:47,900 --> 02:30:49,900
Lockheed Martin special access programs.

3225
02:30:49,900 --> 02:30:51,900
And we'll

3226
02:30:51,900 --> 02:30:53,900
say that they're red teaming our

3227
02:30:53,900 --> 02:30:55,900
detection systems or spoofing us

3228
02:30:55,900 --> 02:30:57,900
or something. Which people say

3229
02:30:57,900 --> 02:30:59,900
doesn't happen. So do you guys

3230
02:30:59,900 --> 02:31:01,900
have opinions on that? Do you think that that's at all

3231
02:31:01,900 --> 02:31:03,900
possible? That some of these

3232
02:31:03,900 --> 02:31:05,900
These guys are training for war. They're not going to do

3233
02:31:05,900 --> 02:31:07,900
that to guys that are training for war in a

3234
02:31:07,900 --> 02:31:09,900
training airspace. It's all right.

3235
02:31:09,900 --> 02:31:11,900
That was when I spoke to Ryan Greer.

3236
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:13,900
That kind of leaves aliens.

3237
02:31:13,900 --> 02:31:15,900
My basic point here is that if we're going to

3238
02:31:15,900 --> 02:31:17,900
entertain extraordinary

3239
02:31:17,900 --> 02:31:19,900
options like aliens or even

3240
02:31:19,900 --> 02:31:21,900
advanced technology being used by

3241
02:31:21,900 --> 02:31:23,900
the Chinese or the Russians, then we should also

3242
02:31:23,900 --> 02:31:25,900
entertain things like maybe

3243
02:31:25,900 --> 02:31:27,900
there's a series of coincidences that happen.

3244
02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:29,900
Can you really say that

3245
02:31:29,900 --> 02:31:31,900
it's less likely?

3246
02:31:31,900 --> 02:31:33,900
Entertain all options, but at some point it just borders on

3247
02:31:33,900 --> 02:31:35,900
the ridiculous. I'm sorry.

3248
02:31:35,900 --> 02:31:37,900
But aliens borders on the ridiculous.

3249
02:31:37,900 --> 02:31:39,900
The historical record is pretty

3250
02:31:39,900 --> 02:31:41,900
remarkable of

3251
02:31:41,900 --> 02:31:43,900
identical performance characteristics,

3252
02:31:43,900 --> 02:31:45,900
wobbling on its edge.

3253
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:47,900
Identical eyewitness reports and people are very similar.

3254
02:31:47,900 --> 02:31:49,900
They've got similar brains and they report things in the same

3255
02:31:49,900 --> 02:31:51,900
way. You picked all the ones that

3256
02:31:51,900 --> 02:31:53,900
wobble? Where

3257
02:31:53,900 --> 02:31:55,900
are all the videos of wobbling discs?

3258
02:31:55,900 --> 02:31:57,900
I picked the ones that are the best

3259
02:31:57,900 --> 02:31:59,900
known and they just happen to

3260
02:31:59,900 --> 02:32:01,900
wobble. When it comes to

3261
02:32:01,900 --> 02:32:03,900
secret American craft,

3262
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:05,900
again, I normally don't

3263
02:32:05,900 --> 02:32:07,900
find myself kind of steel manning this position,

3264
02:32:07,900 --> 02:32:09,900
but it's

3265
02:32:09,900 --> 02:32:11,900
probably more conspiratorial

3266
02:32:11,900 --> 02:32:13,900
to say that we don't have

3267
02:32:13,900 --> 02:32:15,900
craft that is classified

3268
02:32:15,900 --> 02:32:17,900
that exhibits exotic characteristics

3269
02:32:17,900 --> 02:32:19,900
than the inverse. So like

3270
02:32:19,900 --> 02:32:21,900
80% plus of Lockheed, I

3271
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:23,900
think of Skunk Works projects currently

3272
02:32:23,900 --> 02:32:25,900
are classified. And so

3273
02:32:25,900 --> 02:32:27,900
yeah, are there things red teaming our

3274
02:32:27,900 --> 02:32:29,900
systems? And to steel man, your point

3275
02:32:29,900 --> 02:32:31,900
that you just made is I just spoke to Ryan Graves.

3276
02:32:31,900 --> 02:32:33,900
We had a great conversation.

3277
02:32:33,900 --> 02:32:35,900
And he was like, yeah, maybe

3278
02:32:35,900 --> 02:32:37,900
that's happening in spots, but

3279
02:32:37,900 --> 02:32:39,900
in his case, he was stationed at Naval

3280
02:32:39,900 --> 02:32:41,900
Airspace Oceania in

3281
02:32:41,900 --> 02:32:43,900
Virginia. And

3282
02:32:43,900 --> 02:32:45,900
he basically, one of

3283
02:32:45,900 --> 02:32:47,900
his people in his

3284
02:32:47,900 --> 02:32:49,900
squadron, fighter pilots,

3285
02:32:49,900 --> 02:32:51,900
the object almost hit

3286
02:32:51,900 --> 02:32:53,900
the pilot. And it was this

3287
02:32:53,900 --> 02:32:55,900
sphere inside a cube.

3288
02:32:55,900 --> 02:32:57,900
And he was like, they're not going to put us in

3289
02:32:57,900 --> 02:32:59,900
danger if they're kind of red teaming our system.

3290
02:32:59,900 --> 02:33:01,900
So I don't know. Yeah.

3291
02:33:01,900 --> 02:33:03,900
You don't do that over international. We have

3292
02:33:03,900 --> 02:33:05,900
ranges for that. We have designated airspace

3293
02:33:05,900 --> 02:33:07,900
for this kind of stuff.

3294
02:33:07,900 --> 02:33:09,900
I think it's possible that the radar hits

3295
02:33:09,900 --> 02:33:11,900
were some kind of red teaming

3296
02:33:11,900 --> 02:33:13,900
thing because it doesn't really put anybody in danger because

3297
02:33:13,900 --> 02:33:15,900
there's no actual targets. But in this case,

3298
02:33:15,900 --> 02:33:17,900
it was a pilot almost hitting the object.

3299
02:33:17,900 --> 02:33:19,900
Okay, yeah, that's a different thing. But in the gimbal

3300
02:33:19,900 --> 02:33:21,900
thing, for example. You think it's radar spoofing or

3301
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:23,900
something? Yeah, some kind of radar interference.

3302
02:33:23,900 --> 02:33:25,900
Perhaps there was a distant jet and the

3303
02:33:25,900 --> 02:33:27,900
radar got messed up and made it appear

3304
02:33:27,900 --> 02:33:29,900
as someone actually told me that as a

3305
02:33:29,900 --> 02:33:31,900
possibility. How does it account?

3306
02:33:31,900 --> 02:33:33,900
If it's

3307
02:33:33,900 --> 02:33:35,900
something like that, how do you get five or six

3308
02:33:35,900 --> 02:33:37,900
objects moving in concert like that?

3309
02:33:37,900 --> 02:33:39,900
Well, it's the same. It's just one object. You're getting

3310
02:33:39,900 --> 02:33:41,900
five echoes of it or something. I don't understand

3311
02:33:41,900 --> 02:33:43,900
the details, but someone did actually

3312
02:33:43,900 --> 02:33:45,900
mention that to me as a possibility.

3313
02:33:45,900 --> 02:33:47,900
Someone who was familiar with radar obviously

3314
02:33:47,900 --> 02:33:49,900
doesn't want to speak on the record

3315
02:33:49,900 --> 02:33:51,900
because of the stigma that I'm perpetrating.

3316
02:33:51,900 --> 02:33:53,900
But yeah, it's

3317
02:33:55,900 --> 02:33:57,900
I don't know.

3318
02:33:57,900 --> 02:33:59,900
How can we move forward with this?

3319
02:33:59,900 --> 02:34:01,900
I think we actually do need more input.

3320
02:34:01,900 --> 02:34:03,900
Let's get the wizard out there.

3321
02:34:03,900 --> 02:34:05,900
Let's get people who actually

3322
02:34:05,900 --> 02:34:07,900
understand the system to speak

3323
02:34:07,900 --> 02:34:09,900
on it. That would be really good.

3324
02:34:09,900 --> 02:34:11,900
Please. Come out and talk to

3325
02:34:11,900 --> 02:34:13,900
us. I've tried to contact

3326
02:34:13,900 --> 02:34:15,900
Raytheon, and they said, oh, you should talk to the Navy.

3327
02:34:15,900 --> 02:34:17,900
And of course, the Navy doesn't want to talk to anyone.

3328
02:34:17,900 --> 02:34:19,900
They clam up. As soon as it's UAP, they clam up.

3329
02:34:19,900 --> 02:34:21,900
I see it over

3330
02:34:21,900 --> 02:34:23,900
and over and over again.

3331
02:34:23,900 --> 02:34:25,900
Arrow will eventually release something, but

3332
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:27,900
I'm skeptical that it's going to be

3333
02:34:27,900 --> 02:34:29,900
a comprehensive explanation of what's

3334
02:34:29,900 --> 02:34:31,900
going on.

3335
02:34:31,900 --> 02:34:33,900
We should move on.

3336
02:34:33,900 --> 02:34:35,900
So, USS Omaha.

3337
02:34:35,900 --> 02:34:37,900
This is a very

3338
02:34:37,900 --> 02:34:39,900
controversial, interesting case.

3339
02:34:39,900 --> 02:34:41,900
July of 2019, off

3340
02:34:41,900 --> 02:34:43,900
the coast of San Diego. It was released by, I believe,

3341
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:45,900
George Knapp and Jeremy Corvell.

3342
02:34:45,900 --> 02:34:47,900
Admiral Gallaudet, who

3343
02:34:47,900 --> 02:34:49,900
just testified before Congress,

3344
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:51,900
might have some more interesting

3345
02:34:51,900 --> 02:34:53,900
info about this case.

3346
02:34:53,900 --> 02:34:55,900
I think it's mixed turned

3347
02:34:55,900 --> 02:34:57,900
at TSOF.

3348
02:34:57,900 --> 02:34:59,900
I'm not actually that familiar with it, but I'll give you my take on it.

3349
02:34:59,900 --> 02:35:01,900
The video we're going to look at

3350
02:35:01,900 --> 02:35:03,900
is the sphere descending

3351
02:35:03,900 --> 02:35:05,900
into the sea.

3352
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:07,900
It's taken off the screen in

3353
02:35:07,900 --> 02:35:09,900
the command center of the ship.

3354
02:35:09,900 --> 02:35:11,900
We're looking at thermal video again,

3355
02:35:11,900 --> 02:35:13,900
so we're seeing like a heat source,

3356
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:15,900
possibly glare or blooming.

3357
02:35:15,900 --> 02:35:17,900
And it

3358
02:35:17,900 --> 02:35:19,900
kind of looks like it was moving around at first,

3359
02:35:19,900 --> 02:35:21,900
but that's actually just the camera

3360
02:35:21,900 --> 02:35:23,900
moving, the camera that's actually

3361
02:35:23,900 --> 02:35:25,900
recording the thing,

3362
02:35:25,900 --> 02:35:27,900
not the other camera.

3363
02:35:27,900 --> 02:35:29,900
There's a cut in the video

3364
02:35:29,900 --> 02:35:31,900
where it kind of jumps down to a lower level.

3365
02:35:31,900 --> 02:35:33,900
It's actually descending really, really slowly.

3366
02:35:33,900 --> 02:35:35,900
There's cuts where it's just

3367
02:35:35,900 --> 02:35:37,900
above the horizon.

3368
02:35:37,900 --> 02:35:39,900
It's not really moving at all.

3369
02:35:39,900 --> 02:35:41,900
It's just kind of slowly, slowly

3370
02:35:41,900 --> 02:35:43,900
descending to the ocean.

3371
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:45,900
When it gets to approximately

3372
02:35:45,900 --> 02:35:47,900
the horizon, it shrinks

3373
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:49,900
down to a point.

3374
02:35:49,900 --> 02:35:51,900
Then it kind of pops up again, expands

3375
02:35:51,900 --> 02:35:53,900
and then it shrinks again and disappears.

3376
02:35:53,900 --> 02:35:55,900
And I think

3377
02:35:55,900 --> 02:35:57,900
at the end of it, they say

3378
02:35:57,900 --> 02:35:59,900
splash down,

3379
02:35:59,900 --> 02:36:01,900
mark bearing a range.

3380
02:36:01,900 --> 02:36:03,900
So they think that it's actually gone into the water.

3381
02:36:03,900 --> 02:36:05,900
But if you zoom

3382
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:07,900
in on the video, I think it actually looks more like

3383
02:36:07,900 --> 02:36:09,900
it's actually going, it's actually a heat

3384
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:11,900
source that is expounded.

3385
02:36:11,900 --> 02:36:13,900
It's either blooming or glaring.

3386
02:36:13,900 --> 02:36:15,900
And then it goes behind the horizon.

3387
02:36:15,900 --> 02:36:17,900
There's some dispute as to exactly where the

3388
02:36:17,900 --> 02:36:19,900
horizon is. If you move the horizon

3389
02:36:19,900 --> 02:36:21,900
up or down one pixel, it's in front of it.

3390
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:23,900
If you move it a pixel all the way

3391
02:36:23,900 --> 02:36:25,900
it's behind it. There was a guy, I think

3392
02:36:25,900 --> 02:36:27,900
Dr. Phil Metzer,

3393
02:36:27,900 --> 02:36:29,900
he did some analysis of that.

3394
02:36:29,900 --> 02:36:31,900
I published it on Twitter

3395
02:36:31,900 --> 02:36:33,900
and said it was very

3396
02:36:33,900 --> 02:36:35,900
ambiguous as to where the actual horizon was.

3397
02:36:35,900 --> 02:36:37,900
But it's very similar to like

3398
02:36:37,900 --> 02:36:39,900
a light going behind a

3399
02:36:39,900 --> 02:36:41,900
solid object will actually shrink

3400
02:36:41,900 --> 02:36:43,900
if it's a point source as it

3401
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:45,900
goes behind it rather than just

3402
02:36:45,900 --> 02:36:47,900
disappearing.

3403
02:36:47,900 --> 02:36:49,900
So we don't know what it is.

3404
02:36:49,900 --> 02:36:51,900
It appears to be moving,

3405
02:36:51,900 --> 02:36:53,900
I think it appears to be moving northly

3406
02:36:53,900 --> 02:36:55,900
and the wind is coming from that direction.

3407
02:36:55,900 --> 02:36:57,900
Pretty strong winds too. It's apparent wind,

3408
02:36:57,900 --> 02:36:59,900
apparent motion against the wind. But I think

3409
02:36:59,900 --> 02:37:01,900
I don't know what it is but I think

3410
02:37:01,900 --> 02:37:03,900
my best guess is that it's a strong

3411
02:37:03,900 --> 02:37:05,900
heat source that's actually moving away

3412
02:37:05,900 --> 02:37:07,900
and it goes behind

3413
02:37:07,900 --> 02:37:09,900
the horizon.

3414
02:37:09,900 --> 02:37:11,900
There's various interpretations and there's

3415
02:37:11,900 --> 02:37:13,900
more analysis.

3416
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:15,900
Maybe just paint a broader picture. This is part of

3417
02:37:15,900 --> 02:37:17,900
five or six

3418
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:19,900
months long incursions over these

3419
02:37:19,900 --> 02:37:21,900
naval vessels off the Channel Islands

3420
02:37:21,900 --> 02:37:23,900
and off the coast of Southern

3421
02:37:23,900 --> 02:37:25,900
California. Multiple ships

3422
02:37:27,900 --> 02:37:29,900
and they were reporting

3423
02:37:29,900 --> 02:37:31,900
in fact, Jeremy and George

3424
02:37:31,900 --> 02:37:33,900
released a video of

3425
02:37:33,900 --> 02:37:35,900
basically two red lights

3426
02:37:35,900 --> 02:37:37,900
from the Omaha that night.

3427
02:37:37,900 --> 02:37:39,900
And we know that the ship

3428
02:37:39,900 --> 02:37:41,900
was being, sorry, and they were just hovering there

3429
02:37:41,900 --> 02:37:43,900
and I think another one kind of cruises, maybe we can splice

3430
02:37:43,900 --> 02:37:45,900
this in, but another one kind of cruises by

3431
02:37:45,900 --> 02:37:47,900
it. So clearly there were objects around

3432
02:37:47,900 --> 02:37:49,900
the ship. There's no question, right?

3433
02:37:49,900 --> 02:37:51,900
There's radar footage from that

3434
02:37:51,900 --> 02:37:53,900
same night and the

3435
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:55,900
ship is getting swarmed. I think at one point I counted

3436
02:37:55,900 --> 02:37:57,900
ten, twelve.

3437
02:37:57,900 --> 02:37:59,900
Fourteen objects were observed simultaneously.

3438
02:37:59,900 --> 02:38:01,900
The objects were described as

3439
02:38:01,900 --> 02:38:03,900
self-illuminated spheres,

3440
02:38:03,900 --> 02:38:05,900
approximately six feet in diameter.

3441
02:38:05,900 --> 02:38:07,900
So it kind of comports with your kind of orb

3442
02:38:07,900 --> 02:38:09,900
general description. Back to the orb thing

3443
02:38:09,900 --> 02:38:11,900
that has been consistent.

3444
02:38:11,900 --> 02:38:13,900
So where to begin?

3445
02:38:13,900 --> 02:38:15,900
Geez. Number one,

3446
02:38:15,900 --> 02:38:17,900
you can see in the indicator that

3447
02:38:17,900 --> 02:38:19,900
they did have a radar contact at one point.

3448
02:38:19,900 --> 02:38:21,900
A slave of the radar. You saw that R. We know the

3449
02:38:21,900 --> 02:38:23,900
symbology. So again, this is like

3450
02:38:23,900 --> 02:38:25,900
the gimbal. The system says

3451
02:38:25,900 --> 02:38:27,900
tracking a radar target.

3452
02:38:27,900 --> 02:38:29,900
The system's saying that.

3453
02:38:29,900 --> 02:38:31,900
But it clearly isn't in this one. It's been

3454
02:38:31,900 --> 02:38:33,900
done by a joystick. Someone's manually

3455
02:38:33,900 --> 02:38:35,900
moving the camera around.

3456
02:38:35,900 --> 02:38:37,900
They probably, just like with gimbal, same

3457
02:38:37,900 --> 02:38:39,900
thing. They probably had the radar drop it off in

3458
02:38:39,900 --> 02:38:41,900
the system. So you're saying the same thing happened again?

3459
02:38:41,900 --> 02:38:43,900
Like they missed the actual radar target?

3460
02:38:43,900 --> 02:38:45,900
I don't know. Maybe that was the actual

3461
02:38:45,900 --> 02:38:47,900
radar target. Okay.

3462
02:38:47,900 --> 02:38:49,900
Maybe. Then we have the radar.

3463
02:38:49,900 --> 02:38:51,900
It's all within like six miles.

3464
02:38:51,900 --> 02:38:53,900
Five, six miles. All those radar contacts.

3465
02:38:53,900 --> 02:38:55,900
Well, yeah, but that doesn't mean that's the only contact.

3466
02:38:57,900 --> 02:38:59,900
So you think

3467
02:38:59,900 --> 02:39:01,900
they're

3468
02:39:01,900 --> 02:39:03,900
surrounded by like 14 ob, whatever

3469
02:39:03,900 --> 02:39:05,900
it is. There's a lot, right, on that

3470
02:39:05,900 --> 02:39:07,900
radar footage. And you think they

3471
02:39:07,900 --> 02:39:09,900
decided to focus on the object that's 60

3472
02:39:09,900 --> 02:39:11,900
miles away, slowly going

3473
02:39:11,900 --> 02:39:13,900
over the horizon? It was something what the video looks like.

3474
02:39:13,900 --> 02:39:15,900
It looks like... Come on, you've got to

3475
02:39:15,900 --> 02:39:17,900
apply a little common sense here.

3476
02:39:17,900 --> 02:39:19,900
Well, it looks like a plane flying away to me. It's very, very

3477
02:39:19,900 --> 02:39:21,900
similar to the Chilean

3478
02:39:21,900 --> 02:39:23,900
evidence of blooming,

3479
02:39:23,900 --> 02:39:25,900
which is your theory, that is

3480
02:39:25,900 --> 02:39:27,900
that perfectly spherical?

3481
02:39:27,900 --> 02:39:29,900
Perfectly spherical?

3482
02:39:29,900 --> 02:39:31,900
Really? Let's go take a look.

3483
02:39:31,900 --> 02:39:33,900
Compared to like one of the engines of

3484
02:39:33,900 --> 02:39:35,900
the Chilean... Right.

3485
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:37,900
It's all

3486
02:39:37,900 --> 02:39:39,900
distorted. It's not

3487
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:41,900
circular, right? We're kind of getting it.

3488
02:39:41,900 --> 02:39:43,900
No, no, no. There's zero evidence for

3489
02:39:43,900 --> 02:39:45,900
your claim. I've looked at

3490
02:39:45,900 --> 02:39:47,900
a lot of Dave Fauci's Flirvid and

3491
02:39:47,900 --> 02:39:49,900
Thanks Dave for all your work. There's no

3492
02:39:49,900 --> 02:39:51,900
engine that looks like a

3493
02:39:51,900 --> 02:39:53,900
perfectly round sphere. They're generally

3494
02:39:53,900 --> 02:39:55,900
perfectly round. Really?

3495
02:39:55,900 --> 02:39:57,900
Well, if you could show me one, we can go back.

3496
02:39:57,900 --> 02:39:59,900
We looked at it. It's all jagged.

3497
02:39:59,900 --> 02:40:01,900
It's flickering. You know what I'm

3498
02:40:01,900 --> 02:40:03,900
talking about. You know that there's frequently...

3499
02:40:03,900 --> 02:40:05,900
The false ones do flicker a little bit more.

3500
02:40:05,900 --> 02:40:07,900
But I think this is a much more distant object

3501
02:40:07,900 --> 02:40:09,900
and it's zoomed in a lot more. So you have no evidence

3502
02:40:09,900 --> 02:40:11,900
that it's blooming.

3503
02:40:11,900 --> 02:40:13,900
It seems very similar to other things.

3504
02:40:13,900 --> 02:40:15,900
Well, the evidence that it's blooming is that it shrinks

3505
02:40:15,900 --> 02:40:17,900
when it goes behind the horizon. Do you mind if we go on the slideshow

3506
02:40:17,900 --> 02:40:19,900
real quick? Because we can test that

3507
02:40:19,900 --> 02:40:21,900
very... So this is just the shot.

3508
02:40:21,900 --> 02:40:23,900
If you look closely,

3509
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:25,900
you can see the horizon line.

3510
02:40:25,900 --> 02:40:27,900
And the key here

3511
02:40:27,900 --> 02:40:29,900
is

3512
02:40:29,900 --> 02:40:31,900
the horizon is above

3513
02:40:31,900 --> 02:40:33,900
the center

3514
02:40:33,900 --> 02:40:35,900
point of that sphere.

3515
02:40:35,900 --> 02:40:37,900
So if you go down... It's about the same as the...

3516
02:40:37,900 --> 02:40:39,900
We go down to that one.

3517
02:40:39,900 --> 02:40:41,900
That's a line that I drew.

3518
02:40:41,900 --> 02:40:43,900
We'll leave it

3519
02:40:43,900 --> 02:40:45,900
up. A UAP is in the eye of the beholder.

3520
02:40:45,900 --> 02:40:47,900
This is green.

3521
02:40:47,900 --> 02:40:49,900
I see quite a bit of sky underneath that horizon.

3522
02:40:49,900 --> 02:40:51,900
Do you? I don't. But if you go to the next one...

3523
02:40:51,900 --> 02:40:53,900
You see how it's a lot lighter than the rest?

3524
02:40:53,900 --> 02:40:55,900
If you go to the next one, we can see the line that you drew

3525
02:40:55,900 --> 02:40:57,900
and I see a lot of ocean above your line.

3526
02:40:57,900 --> 02:40:59,900
I see an enormous

3527
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:01,900
amount of ocean above. And if you go down to the next one,

3528
02:41:01,900 --> 02:41:03,900
I zoomed in on one section,

3529
02:41:03,900 --> 02:41:05,900
there's clearly ocean above your line.

3530
02:41:05,900 --> 02:41:07,900
There's pixel. There's dark pixel.

3531
02:41:07,900 --> 02:41:09,900
This is the problem with this thing.

3532
02:41:09,900 --> 02:41:11,900
You can't... And this is what Dr. Phil

3533
02:41:11,900 --> 02:41:13,900
was saying, that you can't actually determine exactly where it is.

3534
02:41:13,900 --> 02:41:15,900
We know where it looks like. It's almost exactly

3535
02:41:15,900 --> 02:41:17,900
at the horizon, maybe pixel above, pixel below.

3536
02:41:17,900 --> 02:41:19,900
And it shrinks

3537
02:41:19,900 --> 02:41:21,900
in exactly the same way that the line would shrink.

3538
02:41:21,900 --> 02:41:23,900
Well,

3539
02:41:23,900 --> 02:41:25,900
if you watch SpaceX capsules go down,

3540
02:41:25,900 --> 02:41:27,900
it does the same thing. Remember, we pulled

3541
02:41:27,900 --> 02:41:29,900
those up and they look exactly the same.

3542
02:41:29,900 --> 02:41:31,900
We should dispute that.

3543
02:41:31,900 --> 02:41:33,900
Again, you have no empirical

3544
02:41:33,900 --> 02:41:35,900
evidence that an engine

3545
02:41:35,900 --> 02:41:37,900
actually has that very,

3546
02:41:37,900 --> 02:41:39,900
very clear circular...

3547
02:41:39,900 --> 02:41:41,900
Do you think this is an actual circle that's

3548
02:41:41,900 --> 02:41:43,900
shrinks? It goes in the water.

3549
02:41:43,900 --> 02:41:45,900
That is one thing.

3550
02:41:45,900 --> 02:41:47,900
Let's talk to the air crew.

3551
02:41:47,900 --> 02:41:49,900
Sorry, the air crew.

3552
02:41:49,900 --> 02:41:51,900
Let's listen to what they say.

3553
02:41:51,900 --> 02:41:53,900
They say, first

3554
02:41:53,900 --> 02:41:55,900
thing the guy says, it took off.

3555
02:41:55,900 --> 02:41:57,900
It's booking it. Where does that imply?

3556
02:41:57,900 --> 02:41:59,900
Play the video.

3557
02:41:59,900 --> 02:42:01,900
Do you want to play it? The first

3558
02:42:01,900 --> 02:42:03,900
thing he says, it took off. In this one?

3559
02:42:03,900 --> 02:42:05,900
It's booking it.

3560
02:42:05,900 --> 02:42:07,900
Took off. It's booking it.

3561
02:42:08,900 --> 02:42:10,900
It's not when they're looking at the radar.

3562
02:42:10,900 --> 02:42:12,900
There's multiple radar targets.

3563
02:42:12,900 --> 02:42:14,900
Right there. Yeah, you said.

3564
02:42:14,900 --> 02:42:16,900
It's not moving.

3565
02:42:16,900 --> 02:42:18,900
What does it imply?

3566
02:42:18,900 --> 02:42:20,900
It left the vicinity and it's

3567
02:42:20,900 --> 02:42:22,900
moving very fast. But it's not

3568
02:42:22,900 --> 02:42:24,900
doing that. It took off. It's booking.

3569
02:42:24,900 --> 02:42:26,900
It's booking it. It means it's going very

3570
02:42:26,900 --> 02:42:28,900
fast. So, correct.

3571
02:42:28,900 --> 02:42:30,900
So the implication, as Tim

3572
02:42:30,900 --> 02:42:32,900
mentioned recently, and I think some of the folks

3573
02:42:32,900 --> 02:42:34,900
that were on the bridge of the

3574
02:42:34,900 --> 02:42:36,900
Omaha at this point, during this

3575
02:42:36,900 --> 02:42:38,900
incident, said these things were hovering.

3576
02:42:38,900 --> 02:42:40,900
We have video of these

3577
02:42:40,900 --> 02:42:42,900
things hovering. Jeremy Corbell,

3578
02:42:42,900 --> 02:42:44,900
those two red lights hovering, and

3579
02:42:44,900 --> 02:42:46,900
another one kind of cruising by it.

3580
02:42:46,900 --> 02:42:48,900
It took off. It's booking it. Implies

3581
02:42:48,900 --> 02:42:50,900
to me, it was sitting there

3582
02:42:50,900 --> 02:42:52,900
and then it started moving.

3583
02:42:52,900 --> 02:42:54,900
It's not moving, though. Yes, it is.

3584
02:42:54,900 --> 02:42:56,900
It's clearly moving. Well, it doesn't suddenly

3585
02:42:56,900 --> 02:42:58,900
start moving in that video. It doesn't

3586
02:42:58,900 --> 02:43:00,900
change. So the

3587
02:43:00,900 --> 02:43:02,900
assumption is, it was stationary.

3588
02:43:02,900 --> 02:43:04,900
It starts

3589
02:43:04,900 --> 02:43:06,900
moving and it records it.

3590
02:43:06,900 --> 02:43:08,900
It took off. Is that a fair interpretation?

3591
02:43:08,900 --> 02:43:10,900
It took off. It's booking it. It's very

3592
02:43:10,900 --> 02:43:12,900
speculative, I think. Really?

3593
02:43:12,900 --> 02:43:14,900
You're interpreting what you want to be happening based

3594
02:43:14,900 --> 02:43:16,900
on a few words that somebody said in this video.

3595
02:43:16,900 --> 02:43:18,900
But we have evidence of these objects hovering

3596
02:43:18,900 --> 02:43:20,900
over the deck of the

3597
02:43:20,900 --> 02:43:22,900
Omaha. The drones?

3598
02:43:22,900 --> 02:43:24,900
Whatever they are. It's something with red lights.

3599
02:43:24,900 --> 02:43:26,900
That video is a terrible video,

3600
02:43:26,900 --> 02:43:28,900
the Corbell video. It doesn't

3601
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:30,900
really show anything. It could be drones. It could be planes.

3602
02:43:30,900 --> 02:43:32,900
You know what I'm talking about, right? The two red

3603
02:43:32,900 --> 02:43:34,900
lights with the other one. Yeah, most people think

3604
02:43:34,900 --> 02:43:36,900
it's a silly video. And a lot of the eyewitness

3605
02:43:36,900 --> 02:43:38,900
stuff. So what were those objects? Were they

3606
02:43:38,900 --> 02:43:40,900
just drones flying around? I don't know what they were.

3607
02:43:40,900 --> 02:43:42,900
So here's where it gets really interesting.

3608
02:43:42,900 --> 02:43:44,900
24 hours later, the U.S.

3609
02:43:44,900 --> 02:43:46,900
was Paul Hamilton.

3610
02:43:46,900 --> 02:43:48,900
It's foiled. You can find

3611
02:43:48,900 --> 02:43:50,900
it. We'll put it up.

3612
02:43:50,900 --> 02:43:52,900
Reports the same thing. One of the objects

3613
02:43:52,900 --> 02:43:54,900
splashes. You can see it in the deck log or in

3614
02:43:54,900 --> 02:43:56,900
the briefing of the event.

3615
02:43:56,900 --> 02:43:58,900
If you look at, I don't know if this is diagnostic,

3616
02:43:58,900 --> 02:44:00,900
but if you look at the video footage

3617
02:44:00,900 --> 02:44:02,900
from the Omaha, two of those contacts

3618
02:44:02,900 --> 02:44:04,900
are cruising around. They just disappear off the radar.

3619
02:44:04,900 --> 02:44:06,900
Went in the water.

3620
02:44:06,900 --> 02:44:08,900
It could be in the water. I'm not saying

3621
02:44:08,900 --> 02:44:10,900
that it is. That's not... We're working under the assumption

3622
02:44:10,900 --> 02:44:12,900
I think that there were drones in the area

3623
02:44:12,900 --> 02:44:14,900
because they reported drones and...

3624
02:44:14,900 --> 02:44:16,900
Who knows? The only evidence

3625
02:44:16,900 --> 02:44:18,900
we have shows a spherical object. There's no evidence.

3626
02:44:18,900 --> 02:44:20,900
There's no empirical evidence that

3627
02:44:20,900 --> 02:44:22,900
a... You're taking up

3628
02:44:22,900 --> 02:44:24,900
splash just to be the same as that splash when

3629
02:44:24,900 --> 02:44:26,900
it was probably... Well, they were getting ready to get a...

3630
02:44:26,900 --> 02:44:28,900
They asked three ships around them to get a helicopter

3631
02:44:28,900 --> 02:44:30,900
out. Because they thought that there were drones

3632
02:44:30,900 --> 02:44:32,900
in the area.

3633
02:44:32,900 --> 02:44:34,900
They thought it was close.

3634
02:44:34,900 --> 02:44:36,900
There's a lot of issues with the whole drones thing.

3635
02:44:36,900 --> 02:44:38,900
The army, the military, the navy

3636
02:44:38,900 --> 02:44:40,900
has misinterpreted a lot of things as drones.

3637
02:44:40,900 --> 02:44:42,900
I tweeted

3638
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:44,900
earlier today about how they

3639
02:44:44,900 --> 02:44:46,900
once put out a photo

3640
02:44:46,900 --> 02:44:48,900
of a jet

3641
02:44:48,900 --> 02:44:50,900
and said it was a drone. We know

3642
02:44:50,900 --> 02:44:52,900
that the Snoopy team,

3643
02:44:52,900 --> 02:44:54,900
the trained observers on a navy vehicle,

3644
02:44:54,900 --> 02:44:56,900
have

3645
02:44:56,900 --> 02:44:58,900
misidentified stars as drones.

3646
02:44:58,900 --> 02:45:00,900
And

3647
02:45:00,900 --> 02:45:02,900
what does that have to do with the spherical

3648
02:45:02,900 --> 02:45:04,900
looking object? Well, we were talking about these

3649
02:45:04,900 --> 02:45:06,900
eyewitness accounts of things that happened that go

3650
02:45:06,900 --> 02:45:08,900
along with these videos.

3651
02:45:08,900 --> 02:45:10,900
Maybe they mistook

3652
02:45:10,900 --> 02:45:12,900
something else. Maybe they thought that

3653
02:45:12,900 --> 02:45:14,900
Venus was a spherical object because

3654
02:45:14,900 --> 02:45:16,900
it looks like a bright light

3655
02:45:16,900 --> 02:45:18,900
in the sky, like hundreds of yards

3656
02:45:18,900 --> 02:45:20,900
away. Can you provide a

3657
02:45:20,900 --> 02:45:22,900
single piece of evidence that

3658
02:45:22,900 --> 02:45:24,900
blooming looks like that? Like that very rounds?

3659
02:45:24,900 --> 02:45:26,900
I'll give it a go.

3660
02:45:26,900 --> 02:45:28,900
I looked at a lot of infrared imagery now

3661
02:45:28,900 --> 02:45:30,900
and I haven't seen nothing. That's the natural

3662
02:45:30,900 --> 02:45:32,900
shape for blooming there. I think we should

3663
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:34,900
move on. Admiral Gallaudet

3664
02:45:34,900 --> 02:45:36,900
says that he has a first-hand witness who

3665
02:45:36,900 --> 02:45:38,900
might be coming out soon.

3666
02:45:38,900 --> 02:45:40,900
So let's both, on both sides, we should hope.

3667
02:45:40,900 --> 02:45:42,900
I think you mentioned there's some video.

3668
02:45:42,900 --> 02:45:44,900
That would be great.

3669
02:45:44,900 --> 02:45:46,900
I will say, just

3670
02:45:46,900 --> 02:45:48,900
quickly, so there was another ship that reported

3671
02:45:48,900 --> 02:45:50,900
an object splashing in the water.

3672
02:45:50,900 --> 02:45:52,900
This is where it

3673
02:45:52,900 --> 02:45:54,900
gets kind of, very from an analytic perspective,

3674
02:45:54,900 --> 02:45:56,900
interesting.

3675
02:45:56,900 --> 02:45:58,900
That ship, the Paul Hamilton, so this is the day

3676
02:45:58,900 --> 02:46:00,900
after the Omaha video.

3677
02:46:00,900 --> 02:46:02,900
It's swarmed by a group of

3678
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:04,900
drones, UAP.

3679
02:46:04,900 --> 02:46:06,900
They depart, you can actually

3680
02:46:06,900 --> 02:46:08,900
track this, they depart

3681
02:46:08,900 --> 02:46:10,900
on a heading that goes right towards Guadalupe

3682
02:46:10,900 --> 02:46:12,900
Island.

3683
02:46:12,900 --> 02:46:14,900
And I bring that up because

3684
02:46:14,900 --> 02:46:16,900
there's a series on

3685
02:46:16,900 --> 02:46:18,900
I think National Geographic, Unidentified,

3686
02:46:18,900 --> 02:46:20,900
Luis Elizondo,

3687
02:46:20,900 --> 02:46:22,900
and I think Sean Cahill went down to Guadalupe

3688
02:46:22,900 --> 02:46:24,900
Island because there have been reports of

3689
02:46:24,900 --> 02:46:26,900
spheres going into the water.

3690
02:46:26,900 --> 02:46:28,900
And I spliced the

3691
02:46:28,900 --> 02:46:30,900
interviews together. They had five or six fishermen

3692
02:46:30,900 --> 02:46:32,900
out there, including one of the world's most

3693
02:46:32,900 --> 02:46:34,900
renowned shark experts, a scientist,

3694
02:46:34,900 --> 02:46:36,900
said they've seen these objects.

3695
02:46:36,900 --> 02:46:38,900
The fishermen all say, yeah, I've seen these

3696
02:46:38,900 --> 02:46:40,900
lighted luminous orbs, spheres, going

3697
02:46:40,900 --> 02:46:42,900
into the water. That's interesting, right?

3698
02:46:42,900 --> 02:46:44,900
So you have one group of UAP,

3699
02:46:44,900 --> 02:46:46,900
one splash is recorded as going

3700
02:46:46,900 --> 02:46:48,900
in the water, and then this other group goes right

3701
02:46:48,900 --> 02:46:50,900
towards the location where, oh, by the way,

3702
02:46:50,900 --> 02:46:52,900
witnesses have been recording, reporting

3703
02:46:52,900 --> 02:46:54,900
spheres going in the water.

3704
02:46:54,900 --> 02:46:56,900
There's a military testing area there, isn't it? Isn't there a

3705
02:46:56,900 --> 02:46:58,900
drone base down there where they test military drones?

3706
02:46:58,900 --> 02:47:00,900
That's in the islands.

3707
02:47:00,900 --> 02:47:02,900
It's Mexican. No, but north of there,

3708
02:47:02,900 --> 02:47:04,900
there's an island. So we're talking about, no, we're talking about

3709
02:47:04,900 --> 02:47:06,900
well south of those islands. And Danny Sheen

3710
02:47:06,900 --> 02:47:08,900
just came out as well as a famous

3711
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:10,900
American lawyer

3712
02:47:10,900 --> 02:47:12,900
who represents a lot of UFO whistleblowers.

3713
02:47:12,900 --> 02:47:14,900
And he said that he

3714
02:47:14,900 --> 02:47:16,900
has coordinates for a

3715
02:47:16,900 --> 02:47:18,900
UFO underwater base.

3716
02:47:18,900 --> 02:47:20,900
Go check it out.

3717
02:47:20,900 --> 02:47:22,900
I said we should all do a

3718
02:47:22,900 --> 02:47:24,900
boat trip out there, and we got

3719
02:47:24,900 --> 02:47:26,900
some Twitter momentum.

3720
02:47:28,900 --> 02:47:30,900
I think that's interesting, right?

3721
02:47:30,900 --> 02:47:32,900
Sure, but it's just a lot of eyewitness accounts.

3722
02:47:32,900 --> 02:47:34,900
It is, but it just

3723
02:47:34,900 --> 02:47:36,900
happens to align with

3724
02:47:36,900 --> 02:47:38,900
two splash events.

3725
02:47:38,900 --> 02:47:40,900
A splash just means something going

3726
02:47:40,900 --> 02:47:42,900
in the water. Correct. Do you think these

3727
02:47:42,900 --> 02:47:44,900
guys are genuinely mistaken?

3728
02:47:44,900 --> 02:47:46,900
Do you think they have some sort of incentive?

3729
02:47:46,900 --> 02:47:48,900
Well, the people in the Navy.

3730
02:47:48,900 --> 02:47:50,900
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So you don't

3731
02:47:50,900 --> 02:47:52,900
think they're like Psy-Opping

3732
02:47:52,900 --> 02:47:54,900
the American public or

3733
02:47:54,900 --> 02:47:56,900
wanting money or fame out of it?

3734
02:47:56,900 --> 02:47:58,900
Jay Stratton

3735
02:47:58,900 --> 02:48:00,900
took this slide of three stars and

3736
02:48:00,900 --> 02:48:02,900
presented it to people in Congress.

3737
02:48:02,900 --> 02:48:04,900
He thought that it was

3738
02:48:04,900 --> 02:48:06,900
triangular drones.

3739
02:48:06,900 --> 02:48:08,900
This kind of types of mistake

3740
02:48:08,900 --> 02:48:10,900
goes all the way up the chain. Do you think

3741
02:48:10,900 --> 02:48:12,900
that's still happening today at Arrow?

3742
02:48:12,900 --> 02:48:14,900
And I'm sure they're making mistakes

3743
02:48:14,900 --> 02:48:16,900
still. They couldn't get the date right and they

3744
02:48:16,900 --> 02:48:18,900
go fast.

3745
02:48:18,900 --> 02:48:20,900
Alright, let's move on to Nellis

3746
02:48:20,900 --> 02:48:22,900
Tonopah. Yep.

3747
02:48:22,900 --> 02:48:24,900
So this is a restricted airspace

3748
02:48:24,900 --> 02:48:26,900
testing range. Nellis

3749
02:48:26,900 --> 02:48:28,900
is famous. There's a lot of UFO lore.

3750
02:48:28,900 --> 02:48:30,900
You have this object moving

3751
02:48:30,900 --> 02:48:32,900
towards the Black Mountains.

3752
02:48:32,900 --> 02:48:34,900
Why don't we play this video? It's a little

3753
02:48:34,900 --> 02:48:36,900
lesser known.

3754
02:48:36,900 --> 02:48:42,900
1994.

3755
02:48:42,900 --> 02:48:44,900
There's two

3756
02:48:44,900 --> 02:48:46,900
videos actually.

3757
02:48:46,900 --> 02:48:48,900
Within this clip you mean? You mean

3758
02:48:48,900 --> 02:48:50,900
those two clips here? Within this video?

3759
02:48:50,900 --> 02:48:52,900
I don't actually...

3760
02:48:52,900 --> 02:48:54,900
There's a different video

3761
02:48:54,900 --> 02:48:56,900
following this.

3762
02:48:56,900 --> 02:48:58,900
Stabilized.

3763
02:49:00,900 --> 02:49:02,900
I'll just throw my

3764
02:49:02,900 --> 02:49:04,900
thesis on the table here. I think that's just a

3765
02:49:04,900 --> 02:49:06,900
balloon. Or a bunch of balloons

3766
02:49:06,900 --> 02:49:08,900
floating in the wind.

3767
02:49:14,900 --> 02:49:16,900
The camera is running a lot.

3768
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:18,900
There's no actual movement of the

3769
02:49:18,900 --> 02:49:20,900
object itself. We do have a range

3770
02:49:20,900 --> 02:49:22,900
indicator which tells you how far away

3771
02:49:22,900 --> 02:49:24,900
it is and if you use that we see that

3772
02:49:24,900 --> 02:49:26,900
the range indicator isn't very accurate. It kind of

3773
02:49:26,900 --> 02:49:28,900
like zips back and forward.

3774
02:49:30,900 --> 02:49:32,900
I just think if you're

3775
02:49:32,900 --> 02:49:34,900
operating these

3776
02:49:34,900 --> 02:49:36,900
machines at a

3777
02:49:36,900 --> 02:49:38,900
Nellis testing range you have to be pretty

3778
02:49:38,900 --> 02:49:40,900
familiar with probably exotic

3779
02:49:40,900 --> 02:49:42,900
stuff. Yeah, but look at it.

3780
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:44,900
What can you see there? It does basically

3781
02:49:44,900 --> 02:49:46,900
a 90 degree turn.

3782
02:49:46,900 --> 02:49:48,900
It doesn't. Sure does.

3783
02:49:48,900 --> 02:49:50,900
A guy made a

3784
02:49:50,900 --> 02:49:52,900
metabunk in 1996, sorry,

3785
02:49:52,900 --> 02:49:54,900
a sit-rec and he did a good job. Remember?

3786
02:49:54,900 --> 02:49:56,900
I sent you the video.

3787
02:49:56,900 --> 02:49:58,900
I put this in a sit-rec and you can see that

3788
02:49:58,900 --> 02:50:00,900
the range data is like

3789
02:50:00,900 --> 02:50:02,900
bullshit basically.

3790
02:50:02,900 --> 02:50:04,900
And if you just use the lines of sight

3791
02:50:04,900 --> 02:50:06,900
there's a perfectly reasonable

3792
02:50:06,900 --> 02:50:08,900
wind-driven path for a balloon.

3793
02:50:08,900 --> 02:50:10,900
I'd love to see that because

3794
02:50:10,900 --> 02:50:12,900
it's like a triangle shape.

3795
02:50:16,900 --> 02:50:18,900
This isn't infrared I think.

3796
02:50:18,900 --> 02:50:20,900
No.

3797
02:50:22,900 --> 02:50:24,900
I mean you asked me

3798
02:50:24,900 --> 02:50:26,900
to do it in sit-rec so I did.

3799
02:50:26,900 --> 02:50:28,900
And then you

3800
02:50:28,900 --> 02:50:30,900
took my results and you said that it drew

3801
02:50:30,900 --> 02:50:32,900
what you'd originally

3802
02:50:32,900 --> 02:50:34,900
thought. But I don't think it does.

3803
02:50:34,900 --> 02:50:36,900
I think the results show that the range data

3804
02:50:36,900 --> 02:50:38,900
is very inaccurate. It looks like it's

3805
02:50:38,900 --> 02:50:40,900
morphing in shape.

3806
02:50:40,900 --> 02:50:42,900
Like a bunch of balloons kind of rotating in the sky.

3807
02:50:42,900 --> 02:50:44,900
It does a little bit of like an Apollo, you know, like

3808
02:50:44,900 --> 02:50:46,900
very bizarre.

3809
02:50:46,900 --> 02:50:48,900
This is maybe the weirdest video

3810
02:50:48,900 --> 02:50:50,900
I've seen. It is bizarre.

3811
02:50:50,900 --> 02:50:52,900
Doesn't that look like a bunch of balloons to you?

3812
02:50:54,900 --> 02:50:56,900
It kind of pivots. Yeah, but it looks like the balloons

3813
02:50:56,900 --> 02:50:58,900
are like malleable and

3814
02:50:58,900 --> 02:51:00,900
morphing.

3815
02:51:00,900 --> 02:51:02,900
It looks like it rotates

3816
02:51:02,900 --> 02:51:04,900
in the wind, which is very bizarre.

3817
02:51:04,900 --> 02:51:06,900
I just think if it were balloons and you're

3818
02:51:06,900 --> 02:51:08,900
operating these systems at

3819
02:51:08,900 --> 02:51:10,900
restricted airspace,

3820
02:51:10,900 --> 02:51:12,900
you have to have some protocol for

3821
02:51:12,900 --> 02:51:14,900
balloons. You have to know what

3822
02:51:14,900 --> 02:51:16,900
you're tracking. Yeah, but you wouldn't

3823
02:51:16,900 --> 02:51:18,900
be freaking out. You'd know

3824
02:51:18,900 --> 02:51:20,900
those are just balloons. What's interesting is

3825
02:51:20,900 --> 02:51:22,900
it's coming from

3826
02:51:22,900 --> 02:51:24,900
it's coming from Area 51.

3827
02:51:24,900 --> 02:51:26,900
That is very interesting.

3828
02:51:26,900 --> 02:51:28,900
Yeah, well that's Nell's testing range.

3829
02:51:28,900 --> 02:51:30,900
But it's actually, like if you

3830
02:51:30,900 --> 02:51:32,900
could trace where like it's

3831
02:51:32,900 --> 02:51:34,900
moving west at first and then it takes

3832
02:51:34,900 --> 02:51:36,900
basically a right turn and goes

3833
02:51:36,900 --> 02:51:38,900
north. So shouldn't your Ockham's

3834
02:51:38,900 --> 02:51:40,900
Razor be, you know, well it depends on

3835
02:51:40,900 --> 02:51:42,900
what you think what's going on at Area 51.

3836
02:51:42,900 --> 02:51:44,900
Well, it is an interesting

3837
02:51:44,900 --> 02:51:46,900
twist. It's a military event.

3838
02:51:46,900 --> 02:51:48,900
Why didn't they scramble jets

3839
02:51:48,900 --> 02:51:50,900
and go after it?

3840
02:51:50,900 --> 02:51:52,900
You were all in shock.

3841
02:51:52,900 --> 02:51:54,900
You could hear them like, what is that?

3842
02:51:54,900 --> 02:51:56,900
They were too surprised to scramble jets and do anything?

3843
02:51:56,900 --> 02:51:58,900
No, they didn't do anything. Nothing happened.

3844
02:52:00,900 --> 02:52:02,900
I have no idea.

3845
02:52:02,900 --> 02:52:04,900
That's all we know. All we saw. Maybe they

3846
02:52:04,900 --> 02:52:06,900
scramble jets as soon as that. Maybe they

3847
02:52:06,900 --> 02:52:08,900
realized it was some balloons and didn't scramble jets.

3848
02:52:08,900 --> 02:52:10,900
So it's zipping along, right? And it's

3849
02:52:10,900 --> 02:52:12,900
going due west and then it basically

3850
02:52:12,900 --> 02:52:14,900
does a 90 degree turn. If you

3851
02:52:14,900 --> 02:52:16,900
take the range data. No, you can see

3852
02:52:16,900 --> 02:52:18,900
it visually. Like you can actually see it visually.

3853
02:52:18,900 --> 02:52:20,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3854
02:52:20,900 --> 02:52:22,900
Do you want to play it again or?

3855
02:52:22,900 --> 02:52:24,900
We'll have to revisit this then.

3856
02:52:24,900 --> 02:52:26,900
Yeah, no, I mean, it's quite clear, right?

3857
02:52:26,900 --> 02:52:28,900
It's because it's like, okay, so. The camera moves.

3858
02:52:28,900 --> 02:52:30,900
Let me do this for the folks

3859
02:52:30,900 --> 02:52:32,900
at home. It's going this way,

3860
02:52:32,900 --> 02:52:34,900
right? Going kind of away from you.

3861
02:52:34,900 --> 02:52:36,900
And then it does one of these and flies

3862
02:52:36,900 --> 02:52:38,900
over the camera.

3863
02:52:38,900 --> 02:52:40,900
Yeah, if the range data is correct.

3864
02:52:40,900 --> 02:52:42,900
No, no, you can see it visually. You don't even need the range data.

3865
02:52:42,900 --> 02:52:44,900
It's moving towards the camera.

3866
02:52:44,900 --> 02:52:46,900
So first it's doing this. It's moving

3867
02:52:46,900 --> 02:52:48,900
perpendicular. And then it does

3868
02:52:48,900 --> 02:52:50,900
this. We shall revisit.

3869
02:52:50,900 --> 02:52:52,900
Okay. Okay, next one.

3870
02:52:52,900 --> 02:52:54,900
I like it. We're moving.

3871
02:52:54,900 --> 02:52:56,900
Okay, Aguadilla.

3872
02:52:56,900 --> 02:52:58,900
Aguadilla.

3873
02:52:58,900 --> 02:53:00,900
So this is off the coast of

3874
02:53:00,900 --> 02:53:02,900
Chile? Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico.

3875
02:53:02,900 --> 02:53:04,900
Okay.

3876
02:53:04,900 --> 02:53:06,900
And this is 2013. It's on the

3877
02:53:06,900 --> 02:53:08,900
coast of Puerto Rico. 2013

3878
02:53:08,900 --> 02:53:10,900
on the coast of Puerto Rico, where

3879
02:53:10,900 --> 02:53:12,900
there are a lot of

3880
02:53:12,900 --> 02:53:14,900
sightings. This is

3881
02:53:14,900 --> 02:53:16,900
over the airport.

3882
02:53:16,900 --> 02:53:18,900
At Aguadilla,

3883
02:53:18,900 --> 02:53:20,900
a big tourist destination. There's a bunch of

3884
02:53:20,900 --> 02:53:22,900
hotels up the beach.

3885
02:53:22,900 --> 02:53:24,900
It shows an object that appears to

3886
02:53:24,900 --> 02:53:26,900
be flying in a circle

3887
02:53:26,900 --> 02:53:28,900
around the airport.

3888
02:53:28,900 --> 02:53:30,900
And this is something that's been analyzed

3889
02:53:30,900 --> 02:53:32,900
by a lot of people.

3890
02:53:32,900 --> 02:53:34,900
And the interesting thing about it is

3891
02:53:34,900 --> 02:53:36,900
that it flies in a circle, which is

3892
02:53:36,900 --> 02:53:38,900
kind of unusual for such a small object

3893
02:53:38,900 --> 02:53:40,900
to be doing. And then later

3894
02:53:40,900 --> 02:53:42,900
it appears to

3895
02:53:42,900 --> 02:53:44,900
go underwater. It looks like it

3896
02:53:44,900 --> 02:53:46,900
goes underwater. And then it appears to spit

3897
02:53:46,900 --> 02:53:48,900
into two, spit into

3898
02:53:48,900 --> 02:53:50,900
two parts.

3899
02:53:50,900 --> 02:53:52,900
But a lot

3900
02:53:52,900 --> 02:53:54,900
of people have analyzed this. And pretty

3901
02:53:54,900 --> 02:53:56,900
much everyone who has analyzed it has realized

3902
02:53:56,900 --> 02:53:58,900
that if you take the lines of sight, which

3903
02:53:58,900 --> 02:54:00,900
you can get from the camera here,

3904
02:54:00,900 --> 02:54:02,900
all the numbers on the screen,

3905
02:54:02,900 --> 02:54:04,900
the

3906
02:54:04,900 --> 02:54:06,900
lines of sight all intersect over

3907
02:54:06,900 --> 02:54:08,900
the airport. Not just at the intersection,

3908
02:54:08,900 --> 02:54:10,900
a line over the airport. And that line

3909
02:54:10,900 --> 02:54:12,900
represents a vector that's moving more or less at

3910
02:54:12,900 --> 02:54:14,900
wind speed, about 18 miles per hour.

3911
02:54:14,900 --> 02:54:16,900
And it kind of decreases a little bit as

3912
02:54:16,900 --> 02:54:18,900
the balloon or the object sinks

3913
02:54:18,900 --> 02:54:20,900
to a lower altitude.

3914
02:54:20,900 --> 02:54:22,900
And a theory that was

3915
02:54:22,900 --> 02:54:24,900
proposed by the head

3916
02:54:24,900 --> 02:54:26,900
of Brazil's

3917
02:54:26,900 --> 02:54:28,900
UFO investigation

3918
02:54:28,900 --> 02:54:30,900
department, Ruben Lianza,

3919
02:54:30,900 --> 02:54:32,900
is that it's actually two

3920
02:54:32,900 --> 02:54:34,900
Chinese lanterns, wedding lanterns,

3921
02:54:34,900 --> 02:54:36,900
kind of tied together.

3922
02:54:36,900 --> 02:54:38,900
And that's why you see early on in the video

3923
02:54:38,900 --> 02:54:40,900
you see kind of like two shapes

3924
02:54:40,900 --> 02:54:42,900
kind of like moving around each other.

3925
02:54:42,900 --> 02:54:44,900
Partway through the video you see

3926
02:54:44,900 --> 02:54:46,900
the heat source and then

3927
02:54:46,900 --> 02:54:48,900
you see kind of the paper canopy of the

3928
02:54:48,900 --> 02:54:50,900
lanterns

3929
02:54:50,900 --> 02:54:52,900
behind it. And then when it gets to this

3930
02:54:52,900 --> 02:54:54,900
section here, this is where we see it kind of disappear.

3931
02:54:54,900 --> 02:54:56,900
Now,

3932
02:54:56,900 --> 02:54:58,900
this is thermal footage.

3933
02:54:58,900 --> 02:55:00,900
So we're seeing the black is the hot

3934
02:55:00,900 --> 02:55:02,900
of the flame and there's some blooming or

3935
02:55:02,900 --> 02:55:04,900
glare. And then when it moves,

3936
02:55:04,900 --> 02:55:06,900
so that's hidden by the paper, the paper

3937
02:55:06,900 --> 02:55:08,900
canopy, it

3938
02:55:08,900 --> 02:55:10,900
becomes, you know, it's almost the same

3939
02:55:10,900 --> 02:55:12,900
color as the ocean and the

3940
02:55:12,900 --> 02:55:14,900
media compression just can't keep up with it so it

3941
02:55:14,900 --> 02:55:16,900
disappears. You can more or less see it a lot of

3942
02:55:16,900 --> 02:55:18,900
the time. And then it reappears and it

3943
02:55:18,900 --> 02:55:20,900
kind of like splits into two

3944
02:55:20,900 --> 02:55:22,900
which ties in with the earlier observations

3945
02:55:22,900 --> 02:55:24,900
that there appears to be two heat

3946
02:55:24,900 --> 02:55:26,900
sources, that there's actually

3947
02:55:26,900 --> 02:55:28,900
two wedding lanterns.

3948
02:55:28,900 --> 02:55:30,900
And more research was that there are

3949
02:55:30,900 --> 02:55:32,900
actually hotels up the beach, upwind

3950
02:55:32,900 --> 02:55:34,900
from this location which release

3951
02:55:34,900 --> 02:55:36,900
these types of

3952
02:55:36,900 --> 02:55:38,900
wedding lanterns. And then this was all

3953
02:55:38,900 --> 02:55:40,900
confirmed basically by Arrow

3954
02:55:40,900 --> 02:55:42,900
analyzing this and coming to the same

3955
02:55:42,900 --> 02:55:44,900
conclusion. What do you think, Merrick?

3956
02:55:44,900 --> 02:55:46,900
It'll probably cost me some Twitter

3957
02:55:46,900 --> 02:55:48,900
followers. Great, I agree. I don't have any

3958
02:55:48,900 --> 02:55:50,900
objections. Okay.

3959
02:55:50,900 --> 02:55:52,900
So this is, let's get to here.

3960
02:55:52,900 --> 02:55:54,900
So you guys agree on something? Yeah, absolutely.

3961
02:55:54,900 --> 02:55:56,900
There are people who won't agree.

3962
02:55:56,900 --> 02:55:58,900
SCU, for example. Let me just be clear, I

3963
02:55:58,900 --> 02:56:00,900
agree with the vast variety of mixed

3964
02:56:00,900 --> 02:56:02,900
work. Sure, yeah.

3965
02:56:02,900 --> 02:56:04,900
Because as we know throughout history,

3966
02:56:04,900 --> 02:56:06,900
80-90% of these things are

3967
02:56:06,900 --> 02:56:08,900
prosaically explained, misidentified.

3968
02:56:08,900 --> 02:56:10,900
We've seen this in New Jersey.

3969
02:56:10,900 --> 02:56:12,900
People are literally videotaping

3970
02:56:12,900 --> 02:56:14,900
or recording aircrafts.

3971
02:56:14,900 --> 02:56:16,900
Speaking of which, the world is

3972
02:56:16,900 --> 02:56:18,900
going crazy. There are drones in sensitive

3973
02:56:18,900 --> 02:56:20,900
air spaces, quote-unquote drones,

3974
02:56:20,900 --> 02:56:22,900
and I'm just saying quote-unquote because

3975
02:56:22,900 --> 02:56:24,900
nobody has any good,

3976
02:56:24,900 --> 02:56:26,900
even you have to admit, Mick,

3977
02:56:26,900 --> 02:56:28,900
nobody's coming out and saying anything

3978
02:56:28,900 --> 02:56:30,900
clear about these things on either side.

3979
02:56:30,900 --> 02:56:32,900
One thing that's very, very clear is that there's a lot

3980
02:56:32,900 --> 02:56:34,900
of misidentifications. I believe that.

3981
02:56:34,900 --> 02:56:36,900
I'm sure. And there really aren't

3982
02:56:36,900 --> 02:56:38,900
any good videos that are unambiguously

3983
02:56:38,900 --> 02:56:40,900
of drones or

3984
02:56:40,900 --> 02:56:42,900
some kind of beyond-drone-type

3985
02:56:42,900 --> 02:56:44,900
things. Sure, but would you admit that there's

3986
02:56:44,900 --> 02:56:46,900
a spike globally of

3987
02:56:46,900 --> 02:56:48,900
these weird sightings in sensitive

3988
02:56:48,900 --> 02:56:50,900
air spaces? Is this because there actually

3989
02:56:50,900 --> 02:56:52,900
are more of them or is it because people are

3990
02:56:52,900 --> 02:56:54,900
reporting more of them because of this story has kind of

3991
02:56:54,900 --> 02:56:56,900
blossomed up from these original

3992
02:56:56,900 --> 02:56:58,900
stories of drones over air

3993
02:56:58,900 --> 02:57:00,900
bases? I don't have the data, but my

3994
02:57:00,900 --> 02:57:02,900
strong bias would be that there are more

3995
02:57:02,900 --> 02:57:04,900
sightings going on. All these

3996
02:57:04,900 --> 02:57:06,900
false sightings are just people

3997
02:57:06,900 --> 02:57:08,900
looking at planes, so there's a huge spike in those.

3998
02:57:08,900 --> 02:57:10,900
So why wouldn't it be

3999
02:57:10,900 --> 02:57:12,900
all of this from this huge spike?

4000
02:57:12,900 --> 02:57:14,900
Push back slightly, Mick, just a little bit.

4001
02:57:14,900 --> 02:57:16,900
You're right,

4002
02:57:16,900 --> 02:57:18,900
people misidentify things.

4003
02:57:18,900 --> 02:57:20,900
But I think you

4004
02:57:20,900 --> 02:57:22,900
might be pushing this

4005
02:57:22,900 --> 02:57:24,900
narrative a little too far because

4006
02:57:24,900 --> 02:57:26,900
really the very

4007
02:57:26,900 --> 02:57:28,900
obvious plane videos, there's only like three

4008
02:57:28,900 --> 02:57:30,900
or four of them, they're obvious,

4009
02:57:30,900 --> 02:57:32,900
that are planes. There's

4010
02:57:32,900 --> 02:57:34,900
not that many. There's a lot more

4011
02:57:34,900 --> 02:57:36,900
that are resolvable

4012
02:57:36,900 --> 02:57:38,900
as planes if we know the actual location.

4013
02:57:38,900 --> 02:57:40,900
I got sent one the other day

4014
02:57:40,900 --> 02:57:42,900
and tracked down the actual planes, and it just looked like

4015
02:57:42,900 --> 02:57:44,900
these little points of light. Let's get to the

4016
02:57:44,900 --> 02:57:46,900
weirdest one. It's

4017
02:57:46,900 --> 02:57:48,900
gone completely viral on Twitter. It says Manchester

4018
02:57:48,900 --> 02:57:50,900
Airport, June 2024

4019
02:57:50,900 --> 02:57:52,900
sighting, and you have

4020
02:57:52,900 --> 02:57:54,900
an employee, an anonymous pilot and

4021
02:57:54,900 --> 02:57:56,900
co-pilot,

4022
02:57:56,900 --> 02:57:58,900
see this thing, and

4023
02:57:58,900 --> 02:58:00,900
I think the quote is,

4024
02:58:00,900 --> 02:58:02,900
I've worked in

4025
02:58:02,900 --> 02:58:04,900
aviation for a very long time,

4026
02:58:04,900 --> 02:58:06,900
and I know

4027
02:58:06,900 --> 02:58:08,900
what a weather balloon looks like.

4028
02:58:08,900 --> 02:58:10,900
The report is that this orb comes down,

4029
02:58:10,900 --> 02:58:12,900
hits the tarmac, and then shoots up.

4030
02:58:12,900 --> 02:58:14,900
But he also said it was the size of a small

4031
02:58:14,900 --> 02:58:16,900
car, and that's 24

4032
02:58:16,900 --> 02:58:18,900
inches tops.

4033
02:58:18,900 --> 02:58:20,900
We did very detailed analysis, 3D

4034
02:58:20,900 --> 02:58:22,900
recreation of this thing, from

4035
02:58:22,900 --> 02:58:24,900
the exact viewpoints and using all the data

4036
02:58:24,900 --> 02:58:26,900
that is at the most 24 inches.

4037
02:58:26,900 --> 02:58:28,900
Okay, and Merrick, what do you think?

4038
02:58:28,900 --> 02:58:30,900
I got nothing, guys.

4039
02:58:30,900 --> 02:58:32,900
I don't know.

4040
02:58:32,900 --> 02:58:34,900
So you basically

4041
02:58:34,900 --> 02:58:36,900
agree with Merrick? I think it's a balloon and some

4042
02:58:36,900 --> 02:58:38,900
artifacts in the image there.

4043
02:58:38,900 --> 02:58:40,900
I got nothing.

4044
02:58:40,900 --> 02:58:42,900
We have this interesting case of

4045
02:58:42,900 --> 02:58:44,900
quote unquote UAP activity near Duke

4046
02:58:44,900 --> 02:58:46,900
Energy's nuclear facility in North

4047
02:58:46,900 --> 02:58:48,900
Carolina. I personally find

4048
02:58:48,900 --> 02:58:50,900
this interesting because my Occam's

4049
02:58:50,900 --> 02:58:52,900
Razor belief generally

4050
02:58:52,900 --> 02:58:54,900
is that it's prosaically explainable

4051
02:58:54,900 --> 02:58:56,900
away. The thing I hold

4052
02:58:56,900 --> 02:58:58,900
out interest in

4053
02:58:58,900 --> 02:59:00,900
is when the sighting

4054
02:59:00,900 --> 02:59:02,900
occurs around a nuclear facility.

4055
02:59:02,900 --> 02:59:04,900
I find it very fascinating that

4056
02:59:04,900 --> 02:59:06,900
there is a town next

4057
02:59:06,900 --> 02:59:08,900
to the Fukushima Prefecture in Japan

4058
02:59:08,900 --> 02:59:10,900
called Ino, which is dedicated to

4059
02:59:10,900 --> 02:59:12,900
UFOs, and it's where they had

4060
02:59:12,900 --> 02:59:14,900
their famous 2011 spill

4061
02:59:14,900 --> 02:59:16,900
nuclear,

4062
02:59:16,900 --> 02:59:18,900
and then there have been sightings in

4063
02:59:18,900 --> 02:59:20,900
Bariloche, Argentina, which has its own civilian

4064
02:59:20,900 --> 02:59:22,900
nuclear grid, and then if you look

4065
02:59:22,900 --> 02:59:24,900
at Edward J. Ruppelt, the book you sighted,

4066
02:59:26,900 --> 02:59:28,900
the vast majority of the sightings

4067
02:59:28,900 --> 02:59:30,900
that he takes seriously

4068
02:59:30,900 --> 02:59:32,900
occur around sensitive

4069
02:59:32,900 --> 02:59:34,900
nuclear facilities in the US.

4070
02:59:34,900 --> 02:59:36,900
And then you have Robert Hastings' work,

4071
02:59:36,900 --> 02:59:38,900
and so if I had to

4072
02:59:38,900 --> 02:59:40,900
again, steal me in the UFO

4073
02:59:40,900 --> 02:59:42,900
position, it would be around this nuclear

4074
02:59:42,900 --> 02:59:44,900
connection. So this I find interesting because

4075
02:59:44,900 --> 02:59:46,900
you have UAP activity around this

4076
02:59:46,900 --> 02:59:48,900
nuclear power plant. Should we just watch

4077
02:59:48,900 --> 02:59:50,900
the video? And I'll just quickly say, Jesse,

4078
02:59:50,900 --> 02:59:52,900
your point that the nuclear

4079
02:59:52,900 --> 02:59:54,900
connection is extraordinary.

4080
02:59:54,900 --> 02:59:56,900
It is remarkable, and I've written about

4081
02:59:56,900 --> 02:59:58,900
it. Sorry, go ahead. No, I mean

4082
02:59:58,900 --> 03:00:00,900
it's amazing, and more and more

4083
03:00:00,900 --> 03:00:02,900
Roswell itself, the

4084
03:00:02,900 --> 03:00:04,900
site of the 509th Atomic Bomber Squadron,

4085
03:00:04,900 --> 03:00:06,900
the first bomber squadron in the US,

4086
03:00:06,900 --> 03:00:08,900
you have, you know, the

4087
03:00:08,900 --> 03:00:10,900
Trinity Test Site possibly, there was a crash

4088
03:00:10,900 --> 03:00:12,900
there. Unclear, you have D.D. Johnson

4089
03:00:12,900 --> 03:00:14,900
on one side, you have Jacques Fillet on the other side

4090
03:00:14,900 --> 03:00:16,900
they're kind of arguing. Well, Lani Zamora

4091
03:00:16,900 --> 03:00:18,900
happened a couple miles from there. A couple

4092
03:00:18,900 --> 03:00:20,900
miles from there. It would be the reason

4093
03:00:20,900 --> 03:00:22,900
that New Mexico is such a hot spot.

4094
03:00:22,900 --> 03:00:24,900
It's kind of a

4095
03:00:24,900 --> 03:00:26,900
I think there's a lot of

4096
03:00:26,900 --> 03:00:28,900
reporting bias. You get

4097
03:00:28,900 --> 03:00:30,900
reports on highly sensitive sites

4098
03:00:30,900 --> 03:00:32,900
just because people are much more vigilant.

4099
03:00:32,900 --> 03:00:34,900
People who

4100
03:00:34,900 --> 03:00:36,900
work on these sites are trained to report

4101
03:00:36,900 --> 03:00:38,900
things, and people who work at Wal-Mart

4102
03:00:38,900 --> 03:00:40,900
are not trained to report things like that. You gotta read

4103
03:00:40,900 --> 03:00:42,900
the cable, and this is, again, to

4104
03:00:42,900 --> 03:00:44,900
John Greenwald's credit,

4105
03:00:44,900 --> 03:00:46,900
you gotta read the cable, like 1975,

4106
03:00:46,900 --> 03:00:48,900
do you know anything about those incursions

4107
03:00:48,900 --> 03:00:50,900
where you can see in a

4108
03:00:50,900 --> 03:00:52,900
literally a cable

4109
03:00:52,900 --> 03:00:54,900
to the Pentagon. Is that

4110
03:00:54,900 --> 03:00:56,900
nuclear specific? Absolutely.

4111
03:00:56,900 --> 03:00:58,900
A hundred percent. And it says

4112
03:00:58,900 --> 03:01:00,900
the language is a clear

4113
03:01:00,900 --> 03:01:02,900
intent, so there's objects hovering

4114
03:01:02,900 --> 03:01:04,900
ten feet above their

4115
03:01:04,900 --> 03:01:06,900
nuclear weapon storage facilities, right?

4116
03:01:06,900 --> 03:01:08,900
And there are videos of the plume of

4117
03:01:08,900 --> 03:01:10,900
various detonations where you see the UFOs

4118
03:01:10,900 --> 03:01:12,900
like there's one, Blue

4119
03:01:12,900 --> 03:01:14,900
Gill Triple Prime in 1962.

4120
03:01:14,900 --> 03:01:16,900
I think they were at the spot of plunge

4121
03:01:16,900 --> 03:01:18,900
or something else, but I can't remember what they were exactly,

4122
03:01:18,900 --> 03:01:20,900
but that was resolved as I recall.

4123
03:01:20,900 --> 03:01:22,900
Was it? We'll look it up.

4124
03:01:22,900 --> 03:01:24,900
We should look it up. I'd love to resolve.

4125
03:01:24,900 --> 03:01:26,900
Even Virginia in Brazil

4126
03:01:26,900 --> 03:01:28,900
where James Fox went down

4127
03:01:28,900 --> 03:01:30,900
and investigated for a moment of contact where you have all these

4128
03:01:30,900 --> 03:01:32,900
hapless

4129
03:01:32,900 --> 03:01:34,900
local citizens who don't seem like liars.

4130
03:01:34,900 --> 03:01:36,900
Is there a nuclear power station there?

4131
03:01:36,900 --> 03:01:38,900
That was the start of

4132
03:01:38,900 --> 03:01:40,900
their nuclear program is what I've heard.

4133
03:01:40,900 --> 03:01:42,900
And so, I don't know.

4134
03:01:42,900 --> 03:01:44,900
It just keeps popping up with

4135
03:01:44,900 --> 03:01:46,900
the nuclear thing. And it does cut

4136
03:01:46,900 --> 03:01:48,900
through. Lakenheath, just recently.

4137
03:01:48,900 --> 03:01:50,900
Lakenheath, there you go. It's allegedly

4138
03:01:50,900 --> 03:01:52,900
according to open source reporting that

4139
03:01:52,900 --> 03:01:54,900
it's supposed to host US nuclear

4140
03:01:54,900 --> 03:01:56,900
weapons. Lakenheath was one of the

4141
03:01:56,900 --> 03:01:58,900
site of one of the most extraordinary

4142
03:01:58,900 --> 03:02:00,900
historical accounts. 1956,

4143
03:02:00,900 --> 03:02:02,900
James McDonald wrote

4144
03:02:02,900 --> 03:02:04,900
quite a bit about this in

4145
03:02:04,900 --> 03:02:06,900
folks at home. Just look up Lakenheath

4146
03:02:06,900 --> 03:02:08,900
1956, McDonald, you'll

4147
03:02:08,900 --> 03:02:10,900
find CIA documents.

4148
03:02:10,900 --> 03:02:12,900
You'll find a really

4149
03:02:12,900 --> 03:02:14,900
lengthy write up on the Princeton.edu

4150
03:02:14,900 --> 03:02:16,900
website that is just absolutely

4151
03:02:16,900 --> 03:02:18,900
astounding. Also,

4152
03:02:18,900 --> 03:02:20,900
Royal Air Force Bentwaters.

4153
03:02:20,900 --> 03:02:22,900
1980, yeah.

4154
03:02:22,900 --> 03:02:24,900
You have a bunch of witnesses because

4155
03:02:24,900 --> 03:02:26,900
it was joint managed by the US

4156
03:02:26,900 --> 03:02:28,900
and the Royal Air Force. You have a bunch

4157
03:02:28,900 --> 03:02:30,900
of John Burroughs, Jim

4158
03:02:30,900 --> 03:02:32,900
Penniston, Colonel Halt who did

4159
03:02:32,900 --> 03:02:34,900
the investigation. And the audio.

4160
03:02:34,900 --> 03:02:36,900
I was listening to the book on the way here, UFO

4161
03:02:36,900 --> 03:02:38,900
news. Yeah, what do you think about

4162
03:02:38,900 --> 03:02:40,900
that? I told you to read that.

4163
03:02:40,900 --> 03:02:42,900
I can certainly see how it would seem compelling because there's

4164
03:02:42,900 --> 03:02:44,900
account after account after account of

4165
03:02:44,900 --> 03:02:46,900
something seemed. And if you meet, I

4166
03:02:46,900 --> 03:02:48,900
actually get the sense from you.

4167
03:02:48,900 --> 03:02:50,900
I don't think you're a liar at

4168
03:02:50,900 --> 03:02:52,900
all. I think you're very, no, I mean it.

4169
03:02:52,900 --> 03:02:54,900
I really, I get this

4170
03:02:54,900 --> 03:02:56,900
clear attention to detail,

4171
03:02:56,900 --> 03:02:58,900
good, earnest

4172
03:02:58,900 --> 03:03:00,900
vibe. And that's the same vibe

4173
03:03:00,900 --> 03:03:02,900
I get from Robert Hastings. In fact,

4174
03:03:02,900 --> 03:03:04,900
the way I connected

4175
03:03:04,900 --> 03:03:06,900
with Robert Hastings. I don't think he's lying

4176
03:03:06,900 --> 03:03:08,900
in the book. No, I know you're not accusing him of that.

4177
03:03:08,900 --> 03:03:10,900
But he's dedicated his life

4178
03:03:10,900 --> 03:03:12,900
to this and the amount of granular

4179
03:03:12,900 --> 03:03:14,900
detail. I mean, you should meet him if you're

4180
03:03:14,900 --> 03:03:16,900
interested. He reached out to me

4181
03:03:16,900 --> 03:03:18,900
that this is how I got in touch with him. I made

4182
03:03:18,900 --> 03:03:20,900
my peace with David Grush.

4183
03:03:20,900 --> 03:03:22,900
And I screwed it up

4184
03:03:22,900 --> 03:03:24,900
and I overstated the case. I was like, you know,

4185
03:03:24,900 --> 03:03:26,900
UFOs and nukes,

4186
03:03:26,900 --> 03:03:28,900
you have, you know, over a hundred

4187
03:03:28,900 --> 03:03:30,900
and I go missileers,

4188
03:03:30,900 --> 03:03:32,900
ICBM security personnel, like a few.

4189
03:03:32,900 --> 03:03:34,900
And it was, it's a hundred

4190
03:03:34,900 --> 03:03:36,900
and seventy total witnesses, but it wasn't a

4191
03:03:36,900 --> 03:03:38,900
hundred, you know, radar operators or whatever.

4192
03:03:38,900 --> 03:03:40,900
And I just dispersed in the moment.

4193
03:03:40,900 --> 03:03:42,900
But I love it. He

4194
03:03:42,900 --> 03:03:44,900
emailed me, said Jesse,

4195
03:03:44,900 --> 03:03:46,900
it was only like twelve to

4196
03:03:46,900 --> 03:03:48,900
fifteen. I don't remember the exact number.

4197
03:03:48,900 --> 03:03:50,900
But radar operators, the

4198
03:03:50,900 --> 03:03:52,900
rest were ICBM security

4199
03:03:52,900 --> 03:03:54,900
personnel, you know, missile

4200
03:03:54,900 --> 03:03:56,900
technicians, you know, whatever. And

4201
03:03:56,900 --> 03:03:58,900
it was, and then that's been

4202
03:03:58,900 --> 03:04:00,900
literally like all of my communications

4203
03:04:00,900 --> 03:04:02,900
with him have been around that.

4204
03:04:02,900 --> 03:04:04,900
And he'll correct you immediately if you're wrong.

4205
03:04:04,900 --> 03:04:06,900
And if you're overstating a case.

4206
03:04:06,900 --> 03:04:08,900
Hastings is outstanding. Are there actual statistics here?

4207
03:04:08,900 --> 03:04:10,900
Like actual statistical

4208
03:04:10,900 --> 03:04:12,900
analysis of, you know,

4209
03:04:12,900 --> 03:04:14,900
sightings near nukes versus

4210
03:04:14,900 --> 03:04:16,900
other ways that are actually invalid?

4211
03:04:16,900 --> 03:04:18,900
Well, yeah, it would be Edward J. Ruppelt's

4212
03:04:18,900 --> 03:04:20,900
original study where he came in.

4213
03:04:20,900 --> 03:04:22,900
That was

4214
03:04:22,900 --> 03:04:24,900
done from 1947 to 1952.

4215
03:04:24,900 --> 03:04:26,900
And then he wrote a book about it in 1956.

4216
03:04:26,900 --> 03:04:28,900
I mean, the Colorado

4217
03:04:28,900 --> 03:04:30,900
sightings, right? The 2019, 2020,

4218
03:04:30,900 --> 03:04:32,900
those were over those nuclear

4219
03:04:32,900 --> 03:04:34,900
missile silos, partially,

4220
03:04:34,900 --> 03:04:36,900
partially. And they mirrored 1965,

4221
03:04:36,900 --> 03:04:38,900
the same exact, like they're

4222
03:04:38,900 --> 03:04:40,900
witnesses talking about up and down movement,

4223
03:04:40,900 --> 03:04:42,900
bright flashing lights. Where have we seen that before?

4224
03:04:42,900 --> 03:04:44,900
And it's undocumented, right?

4225
03:04:44,900 --> 03:04:46,900
140 some witnesses.

4226
03:04:46,900 --> 03:04:48,900
And I've met some, I met Robert Salas at

4227
03:04:48,900 --> 03:04:50,900
Malmstrom in 1967. You know,

4228
03:04:50,900 --> 03:04:52,900
that was his sighting where,

4229
03:04:52,900 --> 03:04:54,900
you know, ten of these sites were

4230
03:04:54,900 --> 03:04:56,900
disarmed, according to him. And I've

4231
03:04:56,900 --> 03:04:58,900
also met Mario Woods, who was stationed at,

4232
03:04:58,900 --> 03:05:00,900
you know, South Dakota Ellsworth Air Force Base

4233
03:05:00,900 --> 03:05:02,900
in 1978. He claimed

4234
03:05:02,900 --> 03:05:04,900
to have boarded a craft and been abducted.

4235
03:05:04,900 --> 03:05:06,900
But this guy maintained acute

4236
03:05:06,900 --> 03:05:08,900
clearance for 20 years after this. And

4237
03:05:08,900 --> 03:05:10,900
all these guys, it's the most sensitive

4238
03:05:10,900 --> 03:05:12,900
clearances. They're on what's called the PRP

4239
03:05:12,900 --> 03:05:14,900
program where they have to report if they're taking

4240
03:05:14,900 --> 03:05:16,900
ibuprofen. So I do find that

4241
03:05:16,900 --> 03:05:18,900
compelling. It speaks to the whole, like, issue

4242
03:05:18,900 --> 03:05:20,900
with, you know, Marco Rubio.

4243
03:05:20,900 --> 03:05:22,900
We were talking about it in the start, like,

4244
03:05:22,900 --> 03:05:24,900
you know, either there's some crazy people in power

4245
03:05:24,900 --> 03:05:26,900
or, you know, what they're saying is true.

4246
03:05:26,900 --> 03:05:28,900
And he leans towards true, right? Just to be clear.

4247
03:05:28,900 --> 03:05:30,900
Rubio's very clearly leaning towards

4248
03:05:30,900 --> 03:05:32,900
I trust them. But there is evidence that there are

4249
03:05:32,900 --> 03:05:34,900
crazy people, but

4250
03:05:34,900 --> 03:05:36,900
people with very strange ideas. But who?

4251
03:05:36,900 --> 03:05:38,900
Lekatsky, for example. He's like

4252
03:05:38,900 --> 03:05:40,900
a rocket scientist. Right.

4253
03:05:40,900 --> 03:05:42,900
But I think the more you

4254
03:05:42,900 --> 03:05:44,900
go into, like, you know, highly

4255
03:05:44,900 --> 03:05:46,900
competent, you know, impressive

4256
03:05:46,900 --> 03:05:48,900
circles of people, the more you realize

4257
03:05:48,900 --> 03:05:50,900
a lot of these people are weird. But who?

4258
03:05:50,900 --> 03:05:52,900
Tim Taylor. Yeah, Tim

4259
03:05:52,900 --> 03:05:54,900
Taylor's super weird, but he's also, you know, working

4260
03:05:54,900 --> 03:05:56,900
with Elon Musk around, you know, various

4261
03:05:56,900 --> 03:05:58,900
launches. How weird. That's interesting.

4262
03:05:58,900 --> 03:06:00,900
That just speaks to, like, how much

4263
03:06:00,900 --> 03:06:02,900
weirdness you can actually get.

4264
03:06:02,900 --> 03:06:04,900
But at what point do you say, at what point

4265
03:06:04,900 --> 03:06:06,900
do you say, at what point do you say

4266
03:06:06,900 --> 03:06:08,900
reality is weird and that

4267
03:06:08,900 --> 03:06:10,900
a proxy for somebody's

4268
03:06:10,900 --> 03:06:12,900
credibility is actually how

4269
03:06:12,900 --> 03:06:14,900
high functioning they are in society. Or perhaps it's just a big

4270
03:06:14,900 --> 03:06:16,900
tolerance for weird within the Pentagon.

4271
03:06:16,900 --> 03:06:18,900
How weird do you have, like, you have to be

4272
03:06:18,900 --> 03:06:20,900
pretty darn weird to go to the ICIG

4273
03:06:20,900 --> 03:06:22,900
specter general

4274
03:06:22,900 --> 03:06:24,900
and say, I was part of a

4275
03:06:24,900 --> 03:06:26,900
I was part of a

4276
03:06:26,900 --> 03:06:28,900
reverse engineering program.

4277
03:06:28,900 --> 03:06:30,900
That's right.

4278
03:06:30,900 --> 03:06:32,900
Forty people have done.

4279
03:06:32,900 --> 03:06:34,900
Allegedly. That would crush test

4280
03:06:34,900 --> 03:06:36,900
final growth.

4281
03:06:36,900 --> 03:06:38,900
Does that make sense, right? Okay, there's

4282
03:06:38,900 --> 03:06:40,900
could be weird people, but there's a different level of

4283
03:06:40,900 --> 03:06:42,900
I was on this program.

4284
03:06:42,900 --> 03:06:44,900
I worked on this

4285
03:06:44,900 --> 03:06:46,900
NHI craft.

4286
03:06:46,900 --> 03:06:48,900
That's border, that's delusion.

4287
03:06:48,900 --> 03:06:50,900
There's weird and then there's delusion if they're not

4288
03:06:50,900 --> 03:06:52,900
We don't know what they said.

4289
03:06:52,900 --> 03:06:54,900
Well, enough for

4290
03:06:54,900 --> 03:06:56,900
the Senate intel kit, my god.

4291
03:06:56,900 --> 03:06:58,900
We should move forward. You should meet Hastings at one point.

4292
03:06:58,900 --> 03:07:00,900
Let's watch this Duke video.

4293
03:07:02,900 --> 03:07:04,900
Bro. I am.

4294
03:07:04,900 --> 03:07:06,900
Oh my god.

4295
03:07:06,900 --> 03:07:08,900
What the fuck is going on?

4296
03:07:08,900 --> 03:07:10,900
Oh my fucking god.

4297
03:07:10,900 --> 03:07:12,900
Oh, I wish.

4298
03:07:12,900 --> 03:07:14,900
No, that ain't no brain, yo.

4299
03:07:14,900 --> 03:07:16,900
It's always a pleasure to meet you.

4300
03:07:16,900 --> 03:07:18,900
It's blast.

4301
03:07:18,900 --> 03:07:20,900
Oh, we got a plane.

4302
03:07:20,900 --> 03:07:22,900
Bro.

4303
03:07:22,900 --> 03:07:24,900
Well, top one looks like the landing lights

4304
03:07:24,900 --> 03:07:26,900
of the plane.

4305
03:07:26,900 --> 03:07:28,900
It made a fucking triangle.

4306
03:07:28,900 --> 03:07:30,900
It made a fucking triangle.

4307
03:07:30,900 --> 03:07:32,900
It's three lights in the sky.

4308
03:07:32,900 --> 03:07:34,900
We actually got a fucking.

4309
03:07:34,900 --> 03:07:36,900
Oh my god.

4310
03:07:36,900 --> 03:07:38,900
Oh my god.

4311
03:07:38,900 --> 03:07:40,900
Yeah, you can't get much from that.

4312
03:07:40,900 --> 03:07:42,900
Oh, that's.

4313
03:07:44,900 --> 03:07:46,900
Wait, so one of them, so it's a triangle

4314
03:07:46,900 --> 03:07:48,900
and then one seems to kind of mirror off.

4315
03:07:48,900 --> 03:07:50,900
Yeah.

4316
03:07:50,900 --> 03:07:52,900
Look

4317
03:07:52,900 --> 03:07:54,900
left there.

4318
03:07:54,900 --> 03:07:56,900
The bottom one there is just sitting on the.

4319
03:08:00,900 --> 03:08:02,900
The bottom one is became.

4320
03:08:04,900 --> 03:08:06,900
Yo, Hastings is coming towards us now.

4321
03:08:06,900 --> 03:08:08,900
And he's zoomed in.

4322
03:08:08,900 --> 03:08:10,900
Okay, what are you guys making

4323
03:08:10,900 --> 03:08:12,900
this?

4324
03:08:12,900 --> 03:08:14,900
Mick? Well the white light at the top you can see

4325
03:08:14,900 --> 03:08:16,900
there, it's got two lights, which kind of suggests to me

4326
03:08:16,900 --> 03:08:18,900
that it's the landing lights of a distant plane

4327
03:08:18,900 --> 03:08:23,740
very far away. We see this quite a lot in these videos. People will see a plane that's

4328
03:08:23,740 --> 03:08:28,980
coming directly towards them. It could be like 40, 50, 100 miles away. Not that far.

4329
03:08:28,980 --> 03:08:33,380
And it looks like this. It just sits there and it eventually raises up and it will eventually

4330
03:08:33,380 --> 03:08:36,980
go over them. The other lights I don't know, they were kind of orange looking. I'm not

4331
03:08:36,980 --> 03:08:39,380
sure what they were. It could be helicopters. It could be drones.

4332
03:08:39,380 --> 03:08:43,140
If they're landing lights, Mick, can we test this? Right? Because if I were...

4333
03:08:43,140 --> 03:08:44,140
What?

4334
03:08:44,140 --> 03:08:45,140
Yeah, we could.

4335
03:08:45,140 --> 03:08:49,020
I'm just saying like, because we know where this... Do we know what facility this was?

4336
03:08:49,020 --> 03:08:50,020
Yeah, Duke's Energy.

4337
03:08:50,020 --> 03:08:51,620
But do we have the time and location?

4338
03:08:51,620 --> 03:08:55,660
Well, no, no, but landing lights implies that there's an airport and a final approach path

4339
03:08:55,660 --> 03:08:58,100
somewhere close by. We can test your hypothesis.

4340
03:08:58,100 --> 03:08:59,100
If we have the location.

4341
03:08:59,100 --> 03:09:02,420
Yeah, so it's Southport, North Carolina. So we should look into that.

4342
03:09:02,420 --> 03:09:04,420
That's not really accurate enough. You need it.

4343
03:09:04,420 --> 03:09:05,420
Okay, fair enough.

4344
03:09:05,420 --> 03:09:07,260
Down to the street, pretty much.

4345
03:09:07,260 --> 03:09:10,580
And then we have some other people commenting. I have seven videos of them from last night,

4346
03:09:10,580 --> 03:09:15,500
around 30 minutes of good video. I'm in Asheville, North Carolina. The two mean ones were in

4347
03:09:15,500 --> 03:09:22,540
red, were a red and blue one. The blue one was amazing to watch. Pulsate grow 5X larger

4348
03:09:22,540 --> 03:09:25,540
than shrink back to size. I don't know.

4349
03:09:25,540 --> 03:09:30,220
People post videos of things that are obviously planes and think they're the UFOs. So it's

4350
03:09:30,220 --> 03:09:33,780
not surprising people will post videos of lights in the sky and think they're the UFOs.

4351
03:09:33,780 --> 03:09:36,220
I'm buddies with Tyler, so I'll get some more.

4352
03:09:36,220 --> 03:09:41,980
What I find more compelling maybe than this is, and I'll just be very quick, the Langley

4353
03:09:41,980 --> 03:09:47,940
incursions. There's a witness video where the guy zooms out and you can see, I don't

4354
03:09:47,940 --> 03:09:53,780
know, 10, 15 flashing light. And you can tell they're very, very far out. That is interesting

4355
03:09:53,780 --> 03:09:58,660
in itself, but you see that over the Goldwater training ranges of video. Same thing, just

4356
03:09:58,660 --> 03:10:03,900
unbelievable amounts of flashing lights in the sky. Drones and, oh, by the way, Air Force

4357
03:10:03,940 --> 03:10:09,940
pilots have been reporting drones up to 36 drones, up to 36,000 feet. There's like 30

4358
03:10:09,940 --> 03:10:15,220
or 40 reports over the last couple of years that they, metallic objects, eight or nine,

4359
03:10:15,220 --> 03:10:18,540
it's all documented. It's all out there.

4360
03:10:18,540 --> 03:10:22,740
Can we all agree that we need to figure out what is going on?

4361
03:10:22,740 --> 03:10:26,500
More information would be great. More videos would be great. More analysis from Aero would

4362
03:10:26,500 --> 03:10:28,900
be great. More experts should weigh in.

4363
03:10:28,900 --> 03:10:32,460
I think that's the takeaway. Please, if you're watching at home.

4364
03:10:32,460 --> 03:10:35,740
We have to wrap up in a minute, but do you guys have any opinion on this New Jersey

4365
03:10:35,740 --> 03:10:38,020
thing? Should we play this?

4366
03:10:38,020 --> 03:10:39,020
Look, I ...

4367
03:10:39,020 --> 03:10:50,020
I'll just say quickly, we have the FBI, we have FAA, there's drone restrictions in place.

4368
03:10:50,020 --> 03:10:53,420
There's the governors involved, all the elected officials.

4369
03:10:53,420 --> 03:10:54,420
It's a flap.

4370
03:10:54,420 --> 03:10:55,420
You think it's a flap?

4371
03:10:55,420 --> 03:10:56,420
Yeah.

4372
03:10:56,420 --> 03:10:58,380
I think it's a flap. I don't think there's very much there.

4373
03:10:58,380 --> 03:11:01,100
Do you think Colorado 2019, 2020 was a flap?

4374
03:11:01,100 --> 03:11:02,100
I doubt it very much so.

4375
03:11:02,740 --> 03:11:04,220
Can I read a couple of emails or do we have to go?

4376
03:11:04,220 --> 03:11:05,220
A couple of emails.

4377
03:11:05,220 --> 03:11:06,220
Quick.

4378
03:11:06,220 --> 03:11:09,380
Thanks to Doug Johnson. I'll make this very quick.

4379
03:11:09,380 --> 03:11:13,360
Drone activity. Here we go. Reports from Colorado indicate that drones were not flying as a

4380
03:11:13,360 --> 03:11:16,980
group or pack, but as a single unit. Chase County, Nebraska, Sheriff, Deputy, reported

4381
03:11:16,980 --> 03:11:18,460
observing 30 to 50 ...

4382
03:11:18,460 --> 03:11:19,460
Sheriff.

4383
03:11:19,460 --> 03:11:20,460
Hold on.

4384
03:11:20,460 --> 03:11:26,420
... 30 to 50 flying independently of each other with a larger, quote, mother ship hovering

4385
03:11:26,420 --> 03:11:27,420
for hours.

4386
03:11:27,420 --> 03:11:28,420
You're seeing planes flying overhead.

4387
03:11:28,740 --> 03:11:32,340
Yeah, this idea of a mother ship and then other crafts coming out of the mother ship.

4388
03:11:32,340 --> 03:11:37,500
Chris Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence under both Clinton

4389
03:11:37,500 --> 03:11:43,300
and Bush said that there was this mother ship dynamic going on with the Hampton Air Force

4390
03:11:43,300 --> 03:11:47,900
base incursion as well, where you have these little saucers flying out of a mother ship.

4391
03:11:47,900 --> 03:11:48,900
I don't know.

4392
03:11:48,900 --> 03:11:49,900
Here's a ...

4393
03:11:49,900 --> 03:11:52,300
Here's a hypothesis for the green meteorites in UFOs and nukes, that there was a mother

4394
03:11:52,300 --> 03:11:54,420
ship outside the atmosphere and the green meteorites were ...

4395
03:11:54,420 --> 03:11:57,820
UFOs and nukes mentions this as well, yes.

4396
03:11:58,220 --> 03:12:02,140
He's a K-9 trooper from ... I'll be very quick ... K-9 trooper from Kansas.

4397
03:12:02,140 --> 03:12:03,940
He had these fly right over his head.

4398
03:12:03,940 --> 03:12:06,540
He said one of the drones had a really bright light on it, like a spotlight.

4399
03:12:06,540 --> 03:12:10,020
That drone stayed relatively stationary at that location.

4400
03:12:10,020 --> 03:12:14,820
He then said there were anywhere from 10 to 15 drones that flew all kinds of patterns

4401
03:12:14,820 --> 03:12:16,820
around that stationary drone.

4402
03:12:16,820 --> 03:12:20,060
At one point, one of those flew directly over his house.

4403
03:12:20,060 --> 03:12:23,820
He had night vision with him, so he tried to look at it, made no sound, even though

4404
03:12:23,820 --> 03:12:24,820
the wind was calm.

4405
03:12:24,820 --> 03:12:25,820
All right.

4406
03:12:25,820 --> 03:12:26,820
All right.

4407
03:12:26,820 --> 03:12:27,820
Eyewitness accounts.

4408
03:12:27,820 --> 03:12:28,820
Great.

4409
03:12:28,820 --> 03:12:29,820
Video for all we need.

4410
03:12:29,820 --> 03:12:30,820
Merrick, Mick, this was awesome.

4411
03:12:30,820 --> 03:12:31,820
I appreciate you guys both.

4412
03:12:31,820 --> 03:12:32,820
Thanks for doing this, Mick.

4413
03:12:32,820 --> 03:12:33,820
Thank you.

4414
03:12:33,820 --> 03:12:34,820
Thank you.

4415
03:12:34,820 --> 03:12:35,820
Appreciate it.

4416
03:12:35,820 --> 03:12:36,820
This was great.

4417
03:12:36,820 --> 03:12:38,820
You guys were, I felt, mostly pretty civil and cool with each other.

4418
03:12:38,820 --> 03:12:45,820
I think both of us, all of us, want just more experts to look at this, more data, and

4419
03:12:45,820 --> 03:12:49,820
more witnesses, again, to the extent you're not compromising American national security,

4420
03:12:49,820 --> 03:12:51,820
come out and talk about this stuff.

4421
03:12:51,820 --> 03:12:52,820
I enjoy this very much.

4422
03:12:52,820 --> 03:12:56,820
I enjoy solving cases and investigating them, and if it turns out that I'm wrong about things,

4423
03:12:56,820 --> 03:12:57,820
that would be really interesting.

4424
03:12:57,820 --> 03:12:58,820
You'll buy me a beer.

4425
03:12:58,820 --> 03:12:59,820
Agreed.

4426
03:12:59,820 --> 03:13:01,820
And if Kimball's debunked, I'll buy you a beer.

4427
03:13:01,820 --> 03:13:04,820
And I have a bet that I guess we never resolved.

4428
03:13:04,820 --> 03:13:06,820
We were talking about this before the show.

4429
03:13:06,820 --> 03:13:11,820
I bet you $10,000, which is insane because I gave you one-to-one odds, and it should

4430
03:13:11,820 --> 03:13:19,820
be million-to-one odds that 80%, we'd get 80% consensus in academia, military, and

4431
03:13:19,820 --> 03:13:26,820
civilian sector that non-human intelligence or future humans are occupying these sort

4432
03:13:26,820 --> 03:13:30,820
of anomalous crafts, and that people would, this would become the consensus in 10 years,

4433
03:13:30,820 --> 03:13:35,820
which is, as you pointed out, kind of hard to verify, ultimately, this 80% consensus,

4434
03:13:35,820 --> 03:13:39,820
but you moved that number from 10,000 to 1,000.

4435
03:13:39,820 --> 03:13:43,820
I just like more reasonable bets because it avoids legalities.

4436
03:13:43,820 --> 03:13:46,820
I think it's an unreasonable bet for me.

4437
03:13:46,820 --> 03:13:47,820
It's like a joke for me.

4438
03:13:47,820 --> 03:13:48,820
I'm giving you free money.

4439
03:13:48,820 --> 03:13:50,820
Let's just bet a beer, then.

4440
03:13:50,820 --> 03:13:51,820
Okay.

4441
03:13:51,820 --> 03:13:52,820
Let's do it.

4442
03:13:52,820 --> 03:13:53,820
Awesome.

4443
03:13:53,820 --> 03:13:54,820
Thanks, man.

4444
03:13:54,820 --> 03:13:55,820
We appreciate it.

4445
03:13:55,820 --> 03:13:56,820
Yeah.

4446
03:13:56,820 --> 03:13:57,820
Thank you, guys.

4447
03:13:57,820 --> 03:13:58,820
This was great.

4448
03:13:58,820 --> 03:13:59,820
Awesome.

4449
03:13:59,820 --> 03:14:00,820
All right.

4450
03:14:00,820 --> 03:14:01,820
Cool.

4451
03:14:01,820 --> 03:14:11,820
So we're back with Mick and Merrick, and we felt compelled to extend our debate somewhat

4452
03:14:11,820 --> 03:14:16,820
because so much bombshell footage has been released since our long debate.

4453
03:14:16,820 --> 03:14:21,820
Specifically, we're talking about this egg video that has kind of broken the internet

4454
03:14:21,820 --> 03:14:27,820
over the last couple of days associated with Ross Coulthart's News Nation story involving

4455
03:14:27,820 --> 03:14:32,820
psionic assets, specifically a guy named Jake Barber, who was part of a crash retrieval

4456
03:14:32,820 --> 03:14:40,820
team, involving these psionic assets, people psychically calling in exotic material of

4457
03:14:40,820 --> 03:14:45,820
which this egg is claimed to be kind of a part of that.

4458
03:14:45,820 --> 03:14:49,820
And it's being hooked on to, well, I guess you want to play it, Mick, and we can kind

4459
03:14:49,820 --> 03:14:50,820
of analyze it from there.

4460
03:14:50,820 --> 03:14:51,820
Sure.

4461
03:14:51,820 --> 03:14:52,820
Yeah, let's just play it.

4462
03:14:52,820 --> 03:14:53,820
Yeah.

4463
03:14:53,820 --> 03:14:54,820
So it looks like it's on the end of a long rope.

4464
03:14:54,820 --> 03:14:55,820
It looks like a big egg.

4465
03:14:55,820 --> 03:14:56,820
Yeah.

4466
03:14:56,820 --> 03:14:58,820
It's kind of swaying around, then it hits the ground.

4467
03:14:58,820 --> 03:15:02,820
And you see it kind of roll over, and you see the kind of wrapping around it loose.

4468
03:15:02,820 --> 03:15:04,820
And then you see these wires.

4469
03:15:04,820 --> 03:15:06,820
And this is from the TV show.

4470
03:15:06,820 --> 03:15:10,820
It kind of went in and slowed it down a little bit.

4471
03:15:10,820 --> 03:15:15,820
And you can see like, you know, this lighting coming from over here, there's a shadow in

4472
03:15:15,820 --> 03:15:17,820
this direction.

4473
03:15:17,820 --> 03:15:22,820
There's a little bit of a roll when it hits the ground, which shows it has a little bit

4474
03:15:22,820 --> 03:15:24,820
of inertia.

4475
03:15:24,820 --> 03:15:30,820
And it's not a super high quality video, but you can see that it is kind of like an egg

4476
03:15:30,820 --> 03:15:33,820
shaped object on the end of a rope of some sort.

4477
03:15:33,820 --> 03:15:35,820
We don't know whether it's, is this a real video?

4478
03:15:35,820 --> 03:15:38,820
Is it something that someone's faked?

4479
03:15:38,820 --> 03:15:43,820
I think it was sent anomalously to Ross.

4480
03:15:43,820 --> 03:15:48,820
It wasn't actually taken by the Jake Barber guy, was it?

4481
03:15:48,820 --> 03:15:49,820
It was sent anomalously.

4482
03:15:49,820 --> 03:15:50,820
No, I'm just joking.

4483
03:15:50,820 --> 03:15:53,820
It's like an anomaly.

4484
03:15:53,820 --> 03:15:59,820
Yeah, it was sent by a third party to News Nation, not by Jake.

4485
03:16:00,820 --> 03:16:05,820
And it doesn't show the actual event that he was talking about, which is odd because

4486
03:16:05,820 --> 03:16:09,820
that means that there's multiple versions of these eggs being picked up by different

4487
03:16:09,820 --> 03:16:13,820
people, which apparently there's all these different eggs that people are picking up.

4488
03:16:13,820 --> 03:16:17,820
Maybe it's a very common shape, but it's kind of a new shape to me.

4489
03:16:17,820 --> 03:16:20,820
Like the egg, I guess it's one of the ones that crops up, but it's not like a tic tac.

4490
03:16:20,820 --> 03:16:22,820
It's not like a flying saucer.

4491
03:16:22,820 --> 03:16:23,820
It's an egg.

4492
03:16:23,820 --> 03:16:28,820
I did spend a little bit of time trying to replicate it, and I made a little egg in a

4493
03:16:28,820 --> 03:16:32,820
little sling, so I've got like the whole caboodle.

4494
03:16:32,820 --> 03:16:36,820
It kind of led me to think it's probably not a scale model.

4495
03:16:36,820 --> 03:16:39,820
I don't think it's actually an egg-shaped thing.

4496
03:16:39,820 --> 03:16:41,820
I think it's probably something larger.

4497
03:16:41,820 --> 03:16:46,820
I think it might actually be from a helicopter, and it might be something being moved.

4498
03:16:46,820 --> 03:16:51,820
But yeah, like all these videos, the quality really isn't there.

4499
03:16:51,820 --> 03:16:55,820
It's just very low resolution and it's very short.

4500
03:16:55,820 --> 03:16:56,820
It's very short.

4501
03:16:56,820 --> 03:16:57,820
Where do they chop it off?

4502
03:16:57,820 --> 03:16:59,820
So not a lot to go by.

4503
03:16:59,820 --> 03:17:00,820
Interesting, though.

4504
03:17:00,820 --> 03:17:02,820
Oh, and the backstory, of course, is very interesting.

4505
03:17:02,820 --> 03:17:10,820
I saw Marik, you were talking to Ross Goldthart and Tim Gallaudet about this, and they were

4506
03:17:10,820 --> 03:17:15,820
talking all about all kinds of strange things like psychic powers and stuff like that, which

4507
03:17:15,820 --> 03:17:19,820
was kind of an interesting mixture of things.

4508
03:17:19,820 --> 03:17:24,820
I think we've got a lot of this UFO serve as just nuts and bolts.

4509
03:17:24,820 --> 03:17:27,820
This would be nuts and bolts if it was just like an object being retrieved.

4510
03:17:27,820 --> 03:17:33,820
But then we've got the whole psionic aspect of it, which is a bit weird.

4511
03:17:33,820 --> 03:17:34,820
Yeah.

4512
03:17:34,820 --> 03:17:36,820
Marik, what's your take?

4513
03:17:36,820 --> 03:17:38,820
Damn it, it looks like an egg.

4514
03:17:38,820 --> 03:17:41,820
That's all we got, really.

4515
03:17:41,820 --> 03:17:46,820
What I do find interesting is, and again, I try to bring a bit of an analytic perspective,

4516
03:17:46,820 --> 03:17:50,820
but there's a gentleman named Eric Taber who went to Aero.

4517
03:17:50,820 --> 03:17:54,820
I don't know if, Jesse, if you're familiar with this, but he's an auditor who did speak

4518
03:17:54,820 --> 03:18:00,820
to Aero, and he spoke of an egg-shaped craft being retrieved, and I believe this is at

4519
03:18:00,820 --> 03:18:01,820
Area 51.

4520
03:18:01,820 --> 03:18:05,820
I don't believe he was a firsthand witness, so take it as you will.

4521
03:18:05,820 --> 03:18:08,820
But again, that shape does come up.

4522
03:18:08,820 --> 03:18:09,820
I agree with Mick.

4523
03:18:09,820 --> 03:18:11,820
It's not your standard saucer.

4524
03:18:11,820 --> 03:18:12,820
It's not your orb.

4525
03:18:12,820 --> 03:18:13,820
It's not your sphere.

4526
03:18:13,820 --> 03:18:16,820
The stuff that you hear a lot, it's not a triangle.

4527
03:18:17,820 --> 03:18:25,820
But it seems like there is some precedent for another story of this nature and involving

4528
03:18:25,820 --> 03:18:28,820
an anomalous craft that is egg-shaped.

4529
03:18:28,820 --> 03:18:33,820
It's just a shame we don't have a better video of it, because it just remains somewhat ambiguous.

4530
03:18:33,820 --> 03:18:43,820
Yeah, it definitely felt like this high-resolution footage promise, maybe it's slightly underwhelming.

4531
03:18:43,820 --> 03:18:48,820
And then at the same time, in the instance in which this was a real thing, this is actually

4532
03:18:48,820 --> 03:18:51,820
very good footage comparable to what we've had in the past.

4533
03:18:51,820 --> 03:18:58,820
So it kind of depends on the objective truth, which is this weird epistemic impasse that

4534
03:18:58,820 --> 03:19:03,820
we're facing, where if it is true, it's actually a really good video, and then if it's not,

4535
03:19:03,820 --> 03:19:04,820
obviously not.

4536
03:19:04,820 --> 03:19:06,820
Yeah, I guess that's all.

4537
03:19:06,820 --> 03:19:08,820
All these videos are big if true.

4538
03:19:08,820 --> 03:19:11,820
All these claims are big if true.

4539
03:19:11,820 --> 03:19:16,820
But better than FLIR and Gimbal and GoFast.

4540
03:19:16,820 --> 03:19:18,820
These are different sensor modalities.

4541
03:19:18,820 --> 03:19:20,820
I'm back to differ, Jesse.

4542
03:19:20,820 --> 03:19:25,820
Well, not better from an analytic perspective, the way you're looking at it, Meric, but better

4543
03:19:25,820 --> 03:19:32,820
from, again, if we were to get corroborative sensor data, it would be better for the eye.

4544
03:19:32,820 --> 03:19:35,820
Yeah, this isn't doing anything, though.

4545
03:19:35,820 --> 03:19:41,820
It's just inertly hanging on the end of a rope, and we've got UAPs supposed to have

4546
03:19:41,820 --> 03:19:48,820
all these observables, like sudden acceleration, defying gravity, being hard to see.

4547
03:19:48,820 --> 03:19:52,820
I think what was it, low observability and transmedium travel.

4548
03:19:52,820 --> 03:19:55,820
It's doing none of these things.

4549
03:19:55,820 --> 03:19:59,820
So it's hard to kind of classify this even as a UAP.

4550
03:19:59,820 --> 03:20:03,820
I guess it's the context of the story that's around it that makes it interesting.

4551
03:20:03,820 --> 03:20:10,820
Then we got this Jake Barber, who I believe he was a mechanic on the helicopter, not the pilot.

4552
03:20:10,820 --> 03:20:12,820
I'm not sure.

4553
03:20:12,820 --> 03:20:16,820
I think we might be learning more about that, Mick.

4554
03:20:16,820 --> 03:20:18,820
Okay, that's cool.

4555
03:20:18,820 --> 03:20:23,820
But he did some kind of crash retrieval, apparently.

4556
03:20:23,820 --> 03:20:27,820
There's an interesting story and all kinds of other aspects of that story.

4557
03:20:27,820 --> 03:20:31,820
But it's not doing anything.

4558
03:20:32,820 --> 03:20:34,820
Which is what we need.

4559
03:20:34,820 --> 03:20:37,820
We need videos of things doing things.

4560
03:20:37,820 --> 03:20:40,820
What do you guys make a...

4561
03:20:40,820 --> 03:20:47,820
I feel like the UFO world took a bit of a hard left turn away from Cartesian space,

4562
03:20:47,820 --> 03:20:58,820
aliens from a distant galaxy and into Psy, parapsychology, almost more in line with occult practices or something.

4563
03:20:58,820 --> 03:21:01,820
How do you guys feel about that?

4564
03:21:01,820 --> 03:21:04,820
It seems like a lot of that just suddenly cropped up.

4565
03:21:04,820 --> 03:21:07,820
It was weird because before it was all nuts and bolts.

4566
03:21:07,820 --> 03:21:11,820
And then we suddenly had this drone stuff, which is even more nuts and bolts.

4567
03:21:11,820 --> 03:21:13,820
Everybody's getting into drones.

4568
03:21:13,820 --> 03:21:19,820
And then it's kind of like a hard swing now to psionic powers and Steven Greer type stuff.

4569
03:21:19,820 --> 03:21:22,820
Like Dr. Steven Greer, who does this CE5 stuff.

4570
03:21:22,820 --> 03:21:27,820
And then Ross Colfart, who brought this out, says that he went out with these people

4571
03:21:27,820 --> 03:21:31,820
and they had these psionic assets who could take control of craft,

4572
03:21:31,820 --> 03:21:38,820
which sounds bizarre and frankly ridiculous claim that you could actually cyclically start take over an alien craft.

4573
03:21:38,820 --> 03:21:41,820
You think the aliens would be able to stop that type of thing.

4574
03:21:41,820 --> 03:21:45,820
But it does seem like a weird shift.

4575
03:21:45,820 --> 03:21:50,820
And someone mentioned that they thought things were kind of dying down a bit in the UFO space.

4576
03:21:50,820 --> 03:21:54,820
And so perhaps people are reaching for more interesting things.

4577
03:21:54,820 --> 03:21:57,820
I don't know. But it was weird, definitely.

4578
03:21:57,820 --> 03:21:59,820
What do you think, Merrick?

4579
03:21:59,820 --> 03:22:02,820
I agree. It's a shift.

4580
03:22:02,820 --> 03:22:05,820
Again, I have focused on the nuts and bolts aspect.

4581
03:22:05,820 --> 03:22:07,820
I will say just my own personal progression.

4582
03:22:07,820 --> 03:22:09,820
I've been very open about this.

4583
03:22:09,820 --> 03:22:13,820
I was deeply skeptical of UFOs.

4584
03:22:13,820 --> 03:22:15,820
I missed the 2017 story.

4585
03:22:15,820 --> 03:22:18,820
I think I mentioned this in the longer version.

4586
03:22:18,820 --> 03:22:23,820
But I've gone through a few of my own mini oncological shocks throughout this journey.

4587
03:22:23,820 --> 03:22:28,820
And again, I'm skeptical of everything I see.

4588
03:22:28,820 --> 03:22:31,820
Just kind of right off the bat, I would need to see evidence.

4589
03:22:31,820 --> 03:22:32,820
I have seen evidence.

4590
03:22:32,820 --> 03:22:35,820
Now the gimbal video, Nick knows that we've talked to some experts

4591
03:22:35,820 --> 03:22:37,820
and none of them agree with his theory.

4592
03:22:37,820 --> 03:22:41,820
And one of the most important ones explicitly disagrees with this theory.

4593
03:22:41,820 --> 03:22:47,820
So those are steps on my journey from this is all tinfoil hat,

4594
03:22:47,820 --> 03:22:50,820
whack jobbery to, wow, there's something to this.

4595
03:22:50,820 --> 03:22:53,820
Then the next step was I had people telling me,

4596
03:22:53,820 --> 03:22:55,820
hey, man, there have been crash retrievals.

4597
03:22:55,820 --> 03:22:57,820
And I was deeply skeptical of that having been in the government.

4598
03:22:57,820 --> 03:23:02,820
I was like, there's no possible way that secret could have been kept for X amount of years.

4599
03:23:02,820 --> 03:23:03,820
And now we have people on the road.

4600
03:23:03,820 --> 03:23:08,820
We had Chuck Schumer alleging that in congressional legislation.

4601
03:23:08,820 --> 03:23:10,820
So it's remarkable.

4602
03:23:10,820 --> 03:23:12,820
I've gone through several ontological shocks.

4603
03:23:12,820 --> 03:23:15,820
And I might go through another one with a science.

4604
03:23:15,820 --> 03:23:16,820
I don't know.

4605
03:23:16,820 --> 03:23:17,820
Keeping an open mind.

4606
03:23:18,820 --> 03:23:20,820
Right off the bat and keeping an open mind.

4607
03:23:20,820 --> 03:23:27,820
And I'll just say last, I'll add that Jake and I think the other special operator,

4608
03:23:27,820 --> 03:23:32,820
Fred Baker, who's truly a legend in the community I've found in over the last 24 hours,

4609
03:23:32,820 --> 03:23:36,820
they've said openly, don't trust us.

4610
03:23:36,820 --> 03:23:37,820
We'll show you.

4611
03:23:37,820 --> 03:23:38,820
So, okay.

4612
03:23:38,820 --> 03:23:39,820
That's good.

4613
03:23:39,820 --> 03:23:40,820
Yeah.

4614
03:23:40,820 --> 03:23:41,820
They got a timeline on that.

4615
03:23:41,820 --> 03:23:43,820
You know, we're doing it when it's good.

4616
03:23:44,820 --> 03:23:46,820
But I think that's great.

4617
03:23:46,820 --> 03:23:47,820
That's the right attitude.

4618
03:23:47,820 --> 03:23:48,820
Yeah, definitely.

4619
03:23:48,820 --> 03:23:49,820
Definitely.

4620
03:23:49,820 --> 03:23:54,820
I would definitely appreciate seeing more data and just the stories aren't cutting it.

4621
03:23:54,820 --> 03:23:55,820
We need to see actual evidence.

4622
03:23:55,820 --> 03:23:56,820
I agree.

4623
03:23:56,820 --> 03:23:57,820
I think everybody agrees on that, right?

4624
03:23:57,820 --> 03:23:58,820
Yeah.

4625
03:24:00,820 --> 03:24:01,820
Yeah.

4626
03:24:01,820 --> 03:24:04,820
And Merrick, you had something you wanted to bring up as well.

4627
03:24:04,820 --> 03:24:05,820
Yeah.

4628
03:24:05,820 --> 03:24:06,820
Real quick.

4629
03:24:06,820 --> 03:24:08,820
So I'll just tee this up.

4630
03:24:08,820 --> 03:24:10,820
And Jeremy Corbell, there's a video.

4631
03:24:10,820 --> 03:24:12,820
Mick, I think you figured out when this was posted first.

4632
03:24:12,820 --> 03:24:16,820
But this is the quote unquote Iraq gimbal video.

4633
03:24:16,820 --> 03:24:17,820
But I'll just tee it up first.

4634
03:24:17,820 --> 03:24:22,820
Jeremy got an interview with the Marine who actually recorded this.

4635
03:24:22,820 --> 03:24:25,820
This was in 2008.

4636
03:24:25,820 --> 03:24:28,820
And he's in what's called a LAV, LAV 25.

4637
03:24:28,820 --> 03:24:31,820
I think it's a lightly armored vehicle.

4638
03:24:31,820 --> 03:24:32,820
He's got a thermal site.

4639
03:24:32,820 --> 03:24:36,820
And they're out there in the middle of the desert, truly in the middle of nowhere,

4640
03:24:36,820 --> 03:24:40,820
close to 100 miles from the Syrian border, doing overwatch and reconnaissance.

4641
03:24:40,820 --> 03:24:43,820
So he's looking around to see what's around to make sure nobody,

4642
03:24:43,820 --> 03:24:45,820
the bad guys aren't sneaking up on them at night.

4643
03:24:45,820 --> 03:24:50,820
So he's got this thermal site and he sees an object rising, in his words,

4644
03:24:50,820 --> 03:24:52,820
rising up off of the desert floor.

4645
03:24:52,820 --> 03:24:55,820
And he says it goes up about 25 meters,

4646
03:24:55,820 --> 03:24:59,820
then it moves to about 30 to 50 meters to his left,

4647
03:24:59,820 --> 03:25:01,820
comes back to that center point,

4648
03:25:01,820 --> 03:25:04,820
moves about 30 meters to his right,

4649
03:25:04,820 --> 03:25:08,820
and then goes back to that center point and then slowly starts climbing.

4650
03:25:08,820 --> 03:25:11,820
And then at that point, he's like, this is bizarre.

4651
03:25:11,820 --> 03:25:12,820
I'm going to record this.

4652
03:25:12,820 --> 03:25:14,820
And he starts recording the screen.

4653
03:25:14,820 --> 03:25:16,820
And then we have this video.

4654
03:25:16,820 --> 03:25:18,820
I won't bore people with the full video,

4655
03:25:18,820 --> 03:25:23,820
but I do want to maybe quickly just point out if I can share my screen.

4656
03:25:23,820 --> 03:25:25,820
There are some intriguing similarities.

4657
03:25:25,820 --> 03:25:27,820
Is that coming through for you guys?

4658
03:25:27,820 --> 03:25:29,820
Yep.

4659
03:25:29,820 --> 03:25:32,820
There are some intriguing similarities to Gimbal.

4660
03:25:32,820 --> 03:25:34,820
I think we can agree on that.

4661
03:25:35,820 --> 03:25:39,820
And if Gimbal is this never-before-seen anomaly,

4662
03:25:39,820 --> 03:25:41,820
no expert has ever seen this before.

4663
03:25:41,820 --> 03:25:44,820
I mean, Mick, we were on the call with the AT Flir expert.

4664
03:25:44,820 --> 03:25:45,820
He says this is, quote, bizarre.

4665
03:25:45,820 --> 03:25:47,820
I've never seen anything like this.

4666
03:25:47,820 --> 03:25:49,820
No one could be able to see anything like this.

4667
03:25:49,820 --> 03:25:52,820
So when you see these matches, that's interesting to me.

4668
03:25:52,820 --> 03:25:54,820
Oh, and by the way,

4669
03:25:54,820 --> 03:25:57,820
these anomalies just happen to look like the classic saucer.

4670
03:25:57,820 --> 03:25:59,820
What are the odds, right?

4671
03:25:59,820 --> 03:26:01,820
That's what makes it fun, isn't it?

4672
03:26:01,820 --> 03:26:03,820
It makes it more interesting.

4673
03:26:03,820 --> 03:26:06,820
I'll just quickly add one more thing.

4674
03:26:06,820 --> 03:26:08,820
There's an interesting video.

4675
03:26:08,820 --> 03:26:13,820
And Mick, I know you did a semi-debunk of this,

4676
03:26:13,820 --> 03:26:16,820
but I do have a few bones to pick, per usual.

4677
03:26:16,820 --> 03:26:18,820
Is that coming through for you guys?

4678
03:26:18,820 --> 03:26:20,820
Yeah, I see it.

4679
03:26:20,820 --> 03:26:22,820
It's kind of stepping.

4680
03:26:22,820 --> 03:26:25,820
Yeah, so it does this stepping thing, right?

4681
03:26:25,820 --> 03:26:28,820
And then it would slow down at half speed.

4682
03:26:28,820 --> 03:26:32,820
So he moves the camera up, and you see it jolt down, right?

4683
03:26:32,820 --> 03:26:35,820
So that's moving the cameras, right?

4684
03:26:35,820 --> 03:26:38,820
So this system is a thermal system.

4685
03:26:38,820 --> 03:26:42,820
You can move it left, right, up, down, and it's a thermal sight.

4686
03:26:42,820 --> 03:26:45,820
So the barrel, the gun barrel, there's video of this online.

4687
03:26:45,820 --> 03:26:47,820
The gun barrel is actually pointed to where he...

4688
03:26:47,820 --> 03:26:50,820
This is how they shoot the weapon without getting out of the vehicle, right?

4689
03:26:50,820 --> 03:26:52,820
Yeah, it's a gun sight.

4690
03:26:52,820 --> 03:26:54,820
Exactly, it's literally a gun sight.

4691
03:26:54,820 --> 03:26:57,820
So you can see him moving, but that up and down,

4692
03:26:57,820 --> 03:27:03,820
that kind of that jittery, that jumpy ascent is very interesting to me.

4693
03:27:03,820 --> 03:27:05,820
Yeah, it's an interesting little thing.

4694
03:27:05,820 --> 03:27:08,820
I think, again, we have the issue of it being very poor quality.

4695
03:27:08,820 --> 03:27:11,820
We see here, you see all the compression blocks and everything and the pixels.

4696
03:27:11,820 --> 03:27:14,820
I think there's a couple of points I'd like to make.

4697
03:27:14,820 --> 03:27:17,820
The first is you did that comparison earlier where you did two frames

4698
03:27:17,820 --> 03:27:21,820
that look very similar with the gimbal and this Iraqi gimbal.

4699
03:27:21,820 --> 03:27:26,820
One of them is in the gimbal frame that you showed was in black-hot mode,

4700
03:27:26,820 --> 03:27:29,820
and this is in white-hot.

4701
03:27:29,820 --> 03:27:33,820
And the contrast curves are very different for those two modes.

4702
03:27:33,820 --> 03:27:36,820
It's not really... One isn't the inverse of the other.

4703
03:27:36,820 --> 03:27:40,820
So you're comparing a black-hot to a white-hot isn't a very good comparison.

4704
03:27:40,820 --> 03:27:42,820
And if you were to take the white-hot images,

4705
03:27:42,820 --> 03:27:44,820
which are at the start of the gimbal video,

4706
03:27:44,820 --> 03:27:46,820
they're actually quite different shape to the rest.

4707
03:27:46,820 --> 03:27:48,820
You see a more irregular shape.

4708
03:27:48,820 --> 03:27:51,820
It's kind of like... You're familiar with it.

4709
03:27:51,820 --> 03:27:55,820
It's kind of like narrower at one end and then wider at the other.

4710
03:27:55,820 --> 03:27:57,820
It doesn't really look like that.

4711
03:27:57,820 --> 03:27:59,820
So if you were to actually take that...

4712
03:27:59,820 --> 03:28:02,820
I saw your comment, and as you know, Mick,

4713
03:28:02,820 --> 03:28:05,820
over the course of the gimbal video, the object grows, it gets bigger,

4714
03:28:05,820 --> 03:28:07,820
and it does actually become that shape.

4715
03:28:07,820 --> 03:28:09,820
So I think you're missing the point.

4716
03:28:09,820 --> 03:28:11,820
Anyway, we could talk about this.

4717
03:28:11,820 --> 03:28:13,820
Why is it changing shape, though?

4718
03:28:13,820 --> 03:28:15,820
Is it magically morphing from one shape into another?

4719
03:28:15,820 --> 03:28:17,820
It doesn't really make any sense.

4720
03:28:17,820 --> 03:28:19,820
As the jet gets closer, it becomes more defined, right?

4721
03:28:19,820 --> 03:28:21,820
Well, I think, obviously, as you know,

4722
03:28:21,820 --> 03:28:25,820
I think that the gimbal shape is actually a camera artifact.

4723
03:28:25,820 --> 03:28:27,820
I know you don't like the word glare.

4724
03:28:27,820 --> 03:28:29,820
You don't like the word glare.

4725
03:28:29,820 --> 03:28:31,820
A lot of people agree with me, but...

4726
03:28:31,820 --> 03:28:33,820
No, experts in the world agree with you.

4727
03:28:33,820 --> 03:28:35,820
Yeah, but then the experts that you found...

4728
03:28:35,820 --> 03:28:37,820
We went over this before.

4729
03:28:37,820 --> 03:28:39,820
The experts you found, they also thought that it looked like an SR-71,

4730
03:28:39,820 --> 03:28:41,820
which it looks absolutely nothing like an SR-71.

4731
03:28:41,820 --> 03:28:43,820
So, you know, really all these experts,

4732
03:28:43,820 --> 03:28:45,820
really very good at analyzing this particular video,

4733
03:28:45,820 --> 03:28:47,820
they took a quick take.

4734
03:28:47,820 --> 03:28:49,820
And the guy told you that it was just a quick take

4735
03:28:49,820 --> 03:28:51,820
and it wasn't meant to be an assessment.

4736
03:28:51,820 --> 03:28:53,820
Let's get to that rule.

4737
03:28:53,820 --> 03:28:55,820
What do you think we're looking at right here?

4738
03:28:55,820 --> 03:28:57,820
I don't know what we're looking at,

4739
03:28:57,820 --> 03:28:59,820
but I think, again,

4740
03:28:59,820 --> 03:29:01,820
it's something that doesn't show the observables.

4741
03:29:01,820 --> 03:29:03,820
It's far away,

4742
03:29:03,820 --> 03:29:05,820
so we can't really see it.

4743
03:29:05,820 --> 03:29:07,820
What do you make of this jumping?

4744
03:29:07,820 --> 03:29:09,820
Yeah, the motion, I think.

4745
03:29:09,820 --> 03:29:11,820
Obviously, we don't see

4746
03:29:11,820 --> 03:29:13,820
the really dramatic movements

4747
03:29:13,820 --> 03:29:15,820
that he talked about.

4748
03:29:15,820 --> 03:29:17,820
He's rising up from the desert,

4749
03:29:17,820 --> 03:29:19,820
moving left and right.

4750
03:29:19,820 --> 03:29:21,820
We see it moving slowly up.

4751
03:29:21,820 --> 03:29:23,820
Now, we see it kind of looking like it's kind of

4752
03:29:23,820 --> 03:29:25,820
moving a little bit like this, up and down,

4753
03:29:25,820 --> 03:29:27,820
kind of relative to the background.

4754
03:29:27,820 --> 03:29:29,820
I think what we're seeing there

4755
03:29:29,820 --> 03:29:31,820
is actually the turret

4756
03:29:31,820 --> 03:29:33,820
of the vehicle, or perhaps the vehicle itself,

4757
03:29:33,820 --> 03:29:35,820
with the engine, just moving a tiny little bit

4758
03:29:35,820 --> 03:29:37,820
up and down, which would make the camera move.

4759
03:29:37,820 --> 03:29:39,820
He talked about how he was raising

4760
03:29:39,820 --> 03:29:41,820
the... I have to be careful not to do a Nazi salute here,

4761
03:29:41,820 --> 03:29:43,820
like Elon Musk just did.

4762
03:29:43,820 --> 03:29:45,820
Raising up the

4763
03:29:45,820 --> 03:29:47,820
camera thing,

4764
03:29:47,820 --> 03:29:49,820
so it was always pointing in the sky, and he got

4765
03:29:49,820 --> 03:29:51,820
embarrassed that he thought other people might be looking at him,

4766
03:29:51,820 --> 03:29:53,820
and so he lowered it down.

4767
03:29:53,820 --> 03:29:55,820
But I think doing that is going to make it kind of wobble a little bit,

4768
03:29:55,820 --> 03:29:57,820
because we're kind of zoomed in quite a lot here.

4769
03:29:57,820 --> 03:29:59,820
So I think we're just seeing camera movement.

4770
03:29:59,820 --> 03:30:01,820
It doesn't register exactly

4771
03:30:01,820 --> 03:30:03,820
with the clouds, because the clouds

4772
03:30:03,820 --> 03:30:05,820
are very low

4773
03:30:05,820 --> 03:30:07,820
frequency, in technical terms.

4774
03:30:07,820 --> 03:30:09,820
They're very smooth

4775
03:30:09,820 --> 03:30:11,820
curves, so they don't move very much because of

4776
03:30:11,820 --> 03:30:13,820
the video compression. Now, this video,

4777
03:30:13,820 --> 03:30:15,820
I think it was part of a dump

4778
03:30:15,820 --> 03:30:17,820
that somebody did.

4779
03:30:17,820 --> 03:30:19,820
There's a UFO

4780
03:30:19,820 --> 03:30:21,820
site on Twitter, I think it's called

4781
03:30:21,820 --> 03:30:23,820
Ray Fios, or something like,

4782
03:30:23,820 --> 03:30:25,820
ARIEFOUFOS,

4783
03:30:25,820 --> 03:30:27,820
and they uploaded a whole bunch of stuff

4784
03:30:27,820 --> 03:30:29,820
to MEGA.CO.NZ,

4785
03:30:29,820 --> 03:30:31,820
New Zealand NZ,

4786
03:30:31,820 --> 03:30:33,820
and so there might actually

4787
03:30:33,820 --> 03:30:35,820
be a better version of this out there, which might

4788
03:30:35,820 --> 03:30:37,820
actually help resolve some of these things.

4789
03:30:37,820 --> 03:30:39,820
So if someone knows of that better version,

4790
03:30:39,820 --> 03:30:41,820
then that would be good to have.

4791
03:30:41,820 --> 03:30:43,820
In thermal, you incorrectly thought this

4792
03:30:43,820 --> 03:30:45,820
was a night vision, and thought this was flying.

4793
03:30:45,820 --> 03:30:47,820
What do you think it is?

4794
03:30:47,820 --> 03:30:49,820
Well, I still think the most likely thing

4795
03:30:49,820 --> 03:30:51,820
is essentially the landing lights of an

4796
03:30:51,820 --> 03:30:53,820
aircraft, which do show up in thermal,

4797
03:30:53,820 --> 03:30:55,820
because the halogen lights,

4798
03:30:55,820 --> 03:30:57,820
the hot lights,

4799
03:30:57,820 --> 03:30:59,820
LED lights

4800
03:30:59,820 --> 03:31:01,820
wouldn't show up. How would they be bouncing

4801
03:31:01,820 --> 03:31:03,820
up and down like that, if they were LED?

4802
03:31:03,820 --> 03:31:05,820
Oh, they're not.

4803
03:31:05,820 --> 03:31:07,820
That's the camera bouncing up and down.

4804
03:31:07,820 --> 03:31:09,820
So it's like very little jiggles

4805
03:31:09,820 --> 03:31:11,820
of the camera light, like here,

4806
03:31:11,820 --> 03:31:13,820
would actually make things move around.

4807
03:31:13,820 --> 03:31:15,820
And why would the lights

4808
03:31:15,820 --> 03:31:17,820
be irregularly shaped? Why wouldn't they

4809
03:31:17,820 --> 03:31:19,820
be uniformly distributed?

4810
03:31:19,820 --> 03:31:21,820
Because it's bright, it's looking

4811
03:31:21,820 --> 03:31:23,820
directly into the

4812
03:31:23,820 --> 03:31:25,820
camera. It's like the usual

4813
03:31:25,820 --> 03:31:27,820
glare type thing. So I think it would be

4814
03:31:27,820 --> 03:31:29,820
bright lights in the middle on the landing gear,

4815
03:31:29,820 --> 03:31:31,820
and maybe two lights on the side. I don't know, though.

4816
03:31:31,820 --> 03:31:33,820
I mean, it could be that

4817
03:31:33,820 --> 03:31:35,820
this is...

4818
03:31:35,820 --> 03:31:37,820
Why would there be landing

4819
03:31:37,820 --> 03:31:39,820
lights a hundred miles from

4820
03:31:39,820 --> 03:31:41,820
the Syrian border in

4821
03:31:41,820 --> 03:31:43,820
the middle of the desert in Anbar

4822
03:31:43,820 --> 03:31:45,820
province, or wherever this was? Well, maybe because it was

4823
03:31:45,820 --> 03:31:47,820
landing somewhere. It's a plane.

4824
03:31:47,820 --> 03:31:49,820
It's a military plane. It's not like everything

4825
03:31:49,820 --> 03:31:51,820
up there fires black.

4826
03:31:51,820 --> 03:31:53,820
You can't see lights in thermal.

4827
03:31:53,820 --> 03:31:55,820
You just cannot see... Oh, you can see heat in thermal,

4828
03:31:55,820 --> 03:31:57,820
though, and some lights are very hot.

4829
03:31:57,820 --> 03:31:59,820
You're telling me that as well.

4830
03:31:59,820 --> 03:32:01,820
I don't know.

4831
03:32:01,820 --> 03:32:03,820
I'm not ready to rule

4832
03:32:03,820 --> 03:32:05,820
this out. Where's the engine exhaust if this is a

4833
03:32:05,820 --> 03:32:07,820
plane? The engine exhaust? Well, it would be behind

4834
03:32:07,820 --> 03:32:09,820
where you're looking at.

4835
03:32:09,820 --> 03:32:11,820
If it's coming at you,

4836
03:32:11,820 --> 03:32:13,820
you'd be... Yeah. No, it's

4837
03:32:13,820 --> 03:32:15,820
behind something. When something comes at you, you

4838
03:32:15,820 --> 03:32:17,820
don't see the things that are behind it. I mean, you can't

4839
03:32:17,820 --> 03:32:19,820
see the back of my head, can you?

4840
03:32:19,820 --> 03:32:21,820
It's coming at you like this, right?

4841
03:32:21,820 --> 03:32:23,820
You can see the plumes going... No,

4842
03:32:23,820 --> 03:32:25,820
you really can't. You really can't because

4843
03:32:25,820 --> 03:32:27,820
if it's far away,

4844
03:32:27,820 --> 03:32:29,820
I've taken lots of video of planes

4845
03:32:29,820 --> 03:32:31,820
that are, say, like 50 to 100 miles away

4846
03:32:31,820 --> 03:32:33,820
and where they're coming towards you, the angle

4847
03:32:33,820 --> 03:32:35,820
between the plane and

4848
03:32:35,820 --> 03:32:37,820
you really isn't that much.

4849
03:32:37,820 --> 03:32:39,820
That's one big point we're looking at.

4850
03:32:39,820 --> 03:32:41,820
This is just so bizarre

4851
03:32:41,820 --> 03:32:43,820
to me. It is pretty bizarre, isn't it?

4852
03:32:43,820 --> 03:32:45,820
Yeah, but I don't know what it is. I mean, it could be

4853
03:32:45,820 --> 03:32:47,820
like a weird drone or something,

4854
03:32:47,820 --> 03:32:49,820
but I don't really think it just shows

4855
03:32:49,820 --> 03:32:51,820
any kind of... Stumped undone ears.

4856
03:32:53,820 --> 03:32:55,820
Well, that's fair enough. It just

4857
03:32:55,820 --> 03:32:57,820
happens to look like him. I mean, look

4858
03:32:57,820 --> 03:32:59,820
at this video. It's like you can

4859
03:32:59,820 --> 03:33:01,820
barely read the timecode at the top

4860
03:33:01,820 --> 03:33:03,820
of it. It's a crappy video.

4861
03:33:03,820 --> 03:33:05,820
If we had

4862
03:33:05,820 --> 03:33:07,820
the original video, maybe we'll be able

4863
03:33:07,820 --> 03:33:09,820
to see a little bit more. Maybe we'll be able to prove

4864
03:33:09,820 --> 03:33:11,820
that it was one thing or another, but

4865
03:33:11,820 --> 03:33:13,820
I really don't think we can rule things out from this

4866
03:33:13,820 --> 03:33:15,820
particular video. I mean, I see the plane

4867
03:33:15,820 --> 03:33:17,820
thing isn't super

4868
03:33:17,820 --> 03:33:19,820
compelling. It's not

4869
03:33:19,820 --> 03:33:21,820
compelling at all.

4870
03:33:21,820 --> 03:33:23,820
What I think is it doesn't

4871
03:33:23,820 --> 03:33:25,820
actually demonstrate any of the observables.

4872
03:33:25,820 --> 03:33:27,820
It doesn't demonstrate

4873
03:33:27,820 --> 03:33:29,820
extraordinary motion.

4874
03:33:29,820 --> 03:33:31,820
It's just something... It just

4875
03:33:31,820 --> 03:33:33,820
happens to look like the gimbal in this particular

4876
03:33:33,820 --> 03:33:35,820
frame. As I said, you're taking

4877
03:33:35,820 --> 03:33:37,820
white heart against black heart,

4878
03:33:37,820 --> 03:33:39,820
and if you take all the white heart

4879
03:33:39,820 --> 03:33:41,820
frames from gimbal, they don't actually

4880
03:33:41,820 --> 03:33:43,820
match.

4881
03:33:45,820 --> 03:33:47,820
Because it's not morphed into a

4882
03:33:47,820 --> 03:33:49,820
different shape yet. It gets closer to

4883
03:33:49,820 --> 03:33:51,820
it. It gets 15% larger as it gets

4884
03:33:51,820 --> 03:33:53,820
closer, which is the exact size at the

4885
03:33:53,820 --> 03:33:55,820
correct distance. Why is it changing

4886
03:33:55,820 --> 03:33:57,820
shape? Getting larger doesn't change

4887
03:33:57,820 --> 03:33:59,820
shape. Sure, you pick some frames here that look the same.

4888
03:33:59,820 --> 03:34:01,820
So if you're flying in a jet, Mick,

4889
03:34:01,820 --> 03:34:03,820
you're a pilot, so you know this, right? If you're flying

4890
03:34:03,820 --> 03:34:05,820
at something, it gets larger as you

4891
03:34:05,820 --> 03:34:07,820
get closer to it, right? I'm familiar with perspective

4892
03:34:07,820 --> 03:34:09,820
in America. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

4893
03:34:09,820 --> 03:34:11,820
So that's what happens in a gimbal. And it just happens

4894
03:34:11,820 --> 03:34:13,820
to grow at

4895
03:34:13,820 --> 03:34:15,820
the exact same size

4896
03:34:15,820 --> 03:34:17,820
at the distance. But it doesn't change

4897
03:34:17,820 --> 03:34:19,820
shape. I mean, this egg

4898
03:34:19,820 --> 03:34:21,820
isn't changing shape from here

4899
03:34:21,820 --> 03:34:23,820
to here. It's just a bigger egg.

4900
03:34:23,820 --> 03:34:25,820
One end isn't going to get

4901
03:34:25,820 --> 03:34:27,820
thicker, which is what happens in a gimbal.

4902
03:34:27,820 --> 03:34:29,820
You realize perspective, right?

4903
03:34:29,820 --> 03:34:31,820
And the way they come up

4904
03:34:31,820 --> 03:34:33,820
from behind, right? Or they're

4905
03:34:33,820 --> 03:34:35,820
maneuvering to come in behind

4906
03:34:35,820 --> 03:34:37,820
it, right? So it's not like they're coming directly

4907
03:34:37,820 --> 03:34:39,820
at it, Mick. You know that.

4908
03:34:39,820 --> 03:34:41,820
So you're saying

4909
03:34:41,820 --> 03:34:43,820
the angle of the object changes?

4910
03:34:45,820 --> 03:34:47,820
Yes, absolutely.

4911
03:34:47,820 --> 03:34:49,820
I look forward to you doing

4912
03:34:49,820 --> 03:34:51,820
a 3D model of the gimbal object

4913
03:34:51,820 --> 03:34:53,820
that will demonstrate this change

4914
03:34:53,820 --> 03:34:55,820
in shape. It's already in your Syrac.

4915
03:34:55,820 --> 03:34:57,820
Anyway, we can go on for days.

4916
03:34:57,820 --> 03:34:59,820
We could go on for days.

4917
03:34:59,820 --> 03:35:01,820
And I go into this

4918
03:35:01,820 --> 03:35:03,820
in the

4919
03:35:03,820 --> 03:35:05,820
longer interview. But again, the bottom line is

4920
03:35:05,820 --> 03:35:07,820
no experts agree with Mick.

4921
03:35:07,820 --> 03:35:09,820
And literally, one of the

4922
03:35:09,820 --> 03:35:11,820
top air-to-air infrared

4923
03:35:11,820 --> 03:35:13,820
experts explicitly disagree with this

4924
03:35:13,820 --> 03:35:15,820
theory. Yeah, I came up with another cockamamie

4925
03:35:15,820 --> 03:35:17,820
theory, which is completely wrong as well.

4926
03:35:17,820 --> 03:35:19,820
So what are you going to do? I think

4927
03:35:19,820 --> 03:35:21,820
we've got some crappy videos here,

4928
03:35:21,820 --> 03:35:23,820
which are unfortunately the best videos that we have.

4929
03:35:23,820 --> 03:35:25,820
And I think that in itself is a huge

4930
03:35:25,820 --> 03:35:27,820
clue about ufology. The only videos

4931
03:35:27,820 --> 03:35:29,820
that we get are crappy videos.

4932
03:35:29,820 --> 03:35:31,820
And the reason that we only get crappy

4933
03:35:31,820 --> 03:35:33,820
videos is that the videos were better quality

4934
03:35:33,820 --> 03:35:35,820
would be able to tell what the thing was. And then

4935
03:35:35,820 --> 03:35:37,820
we'd know it

4936
03:35:37,820 --> 03:35:39,820
was a UFO or not. None of the

4937
03:35:39,820 --> 03:35:41,820
good videos show UFOs.

4938
03:35:41,820 --> 03:35:43,820
All we're left with is these crappy videos.

4939
03:35:43,820 --> 03:35:45,820
It's the low information zone.

4940
03:35:45,820 --> 03:35:47,820
That's how UFOs work. I don't

4941
03:35:47,820 --> 03:35:49,820
think so, Mick. And I hope

4942
03:35:49,820 --> 03:35:51,820
we learn more. But the Pentagon has

4943
03:35:51,820 --> 03:35:53,820
said that they have, quote,

4944
03:35:53,820 --> 03:35:55,820
true anomalies that they're so

4945
03:35:55,820 --> 03:35:57,820
stumped by. And this is because the new director

4946
03:35:57,820 --> 03:35:59,820
in the Pentagon's UFO office has

4947
03:35:59,820 --> 03:36:01,820
said, we have true anomalies that

4948
03:36:01,820 --> 03:36:03,820
I, as an engineer and a physicist,

4949
03:36:03,820 --> 03:36:05,820
I'm paraphrasing, do not understand.

4950
03:36:05,820 --> 03:36:07,820
And I do not know anybody else

4951
03:36:07,820 --> 03:36:09,820
who understands. So let's see what those videos are.

4952
03:36:09,820 --> 03:36:11,820
That's because they haven't got the information.

4953
03:36:11,820 --> 03:36:13,820
But yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing those

4954
03:36:13,820 --> 03:36:15,820
true anomalies. They said they're so stumped

4955
03:36:15,820 --> 03:36:17,820
that they need the public. So that's me.

4956
03:36:17,820 --> 03:36:19,820
That's you, Mick. That's me. That's everybody.

4957
03:36:19,820 --> 03:36:21,820
That's everybody that's watching.

4958
03:36:21,820 --> 03:36:23,820
They can use my software,

4959
03:36:23,820 --> 03:36:25,820
Open Source, SITREC. Anyone can use it.

4960
03:36:25,820 --> 03:36:27,820
And hopefully they will. And maybe it'll help

4961
03:36:27,820 --> 03:36:29,820
them solve it. I'd be happy to help.

4962
03:36:29,820 --> 03:36:31,820
Whatever we're

4963
03:36:31,820 --> 03:36:33,820
seeing is definitely at the margins

4964
03:36:33,820 --> 03:36:35,820
of reality. And so

4965
03:36:35,820 --> 03:36:37,820
I think we wouldn't be having this debate if it was

4966
03:36:37,820 --> 03:36:39,820
super clear. The margins

4967
03:36:39,820 --> 03:36:41,820
of perception, which

4968
03:36:41,820 --> 03:36:43,820
isn't really the margins of reality.

4969
03:36:43,820 --> 03:36:45,820
Well, there you go. Now you're talking

4970
03:36:45,820 --> 03:36:47,820
like us. I mean,

4971
03:36:47,820 --> 03:36:49,820
I think, yeah, the margins of

4972
03:36:49,820 --> 03:36:51,820
our, because we, there are doors

4973
03:36:51,820 --> 03:36:53,820
of perception, to quote William Blake

4974
03:36:53,820 --> 03:36:55,820
or Aldous Huxley, and

4975
03:36:55,820 --> 03:36:57,820
the optical range that involves

4976
03:36:57,820 --> 03:36:59,820
400 to 700 nanometers.

4977
03:36:59,820 --> 03:37:01,820
And if you have

4978
03:37:01,820 --> 03:37:03,820
these things traveling

4979
03:37:03,820 --> 03:37:05,820
close to the speed of light, they're probably doing

4980
03:37:05,820 --> 03:37:07,820
one of two things. They're probably,

4981
03:37:07,820 --> 03:37:09,820
if they're moving away

4982
03:37:09,820 --> 03:37:11,820
from you, they're stretching light. And so

4983
03:37:11,820 --> 03:37:13,820
that's like the bottom

4984
03:37:13,820 --> 03:37:15,820
end of the visible band, but probably lower

4985
03:37:15,820 --> 03:37:17,820
than what we can actually see. And then

4986
03:37:17,820 --> 03:37:19,820
if they're coming towards you, they're crunching

4987
03:37:19,820 --> 03:37:21,820
light. And so that's, you know, your microwaves.

4988
03:37:21,820 --> 03:37:23,820
And so it's either, you know, it's

4989
03:37:23,820 --> 03:37:25,820
going to be infrared or microwave,

4990
03:37:25,820 --> 03:37:27,820
and you need these sensor modalities.

4991
03:37:27,820 --> 03:37:29,820
Normal civilians don't have those sensor modalities.

4992
03:37:29,820 --> 03:37:31,820
And so it kind of makes sense

4993
03:37:31,820 --> 03:37:33,820
that you would either get blue

4994
03:37:33,820 --> 03:37:35,820
shifted or red shifted optical, or

4995
03:37:35,820 --> 03:37:37,820
you would get like other sensors, and

4996
03:37:37,820 --> 03:37:39,820
you'd have to debate it endlessly

4997
03:37:39,820 --> 03:37:41,820
because it wouldn't really look like

4998
03:37:41,820 --> 03:37:43,820
the normal eye.

4999
03:37:43,820 --> 03:37:45,820
Have some non-UFO physicists

5000
03:37:45,820 --> 03:37:47,820
about that. I mean, Hal Puthoff says

5001
03:37:47,820 --> 03:37:49,820
things like that, yes, but I think you

5002
03:37:49,820 --> 03:37:51,820
should need to ask some, I hesitate to say

5003
03:37:51,820 --> 03:37:53,820
real physicists, but someone who isn't

5004
03:37:53,820 --> 03:37:55,820
perhaps so enmeshed in this whole

5005
03:37:55,820 --> 03:37:57,820
UAP thing.

5006
03:37:57,820 --> 03:37:59,820
What would they say? Yeah, go for it.

5007
03:37:59,820 --> 03:38:01,820
Just very quickly, and

5008
03:38:01,820 --> 03:38:03,820
Jesse, to build on that, there's

5009
03:38:03,820 --> 03:38:05,820
a documented history of

5010
03:38:05,820 --> 03:38:07,820
the most important, kind of one of the

5011
03:38:07,820 --> 03:38:09,820
most important historical documents in

5012
03:38:09,820 --> 03:38:11,820
this whole topic, is what's called the

5013
03:38:11,820 --> 03:38:13,820
Twining Memo from 1947.

5014
03:38:13,820 --> 03:38:15,820
General Nathan Twining, who I

5015
03:38:15,820 --> 03:38:17,820
believe went on to become the chairman of the Joint

5016
03:38:17,820 --> 03:38:19,820
Chiefs of Staff, he

5017
03:38:19,820 --> 03:38:21,820
wrote a memo that said, it listed

5018
03:38:21,820 --> 03:38:23,820
all the characteristics of UFOs,

5019
03:38:23,820 --> 03:38:25,820
and I think the one word that was underlying

5020
03:38:25,820 --> 03:38:27,820
was that they are invasive. As soon

5021
03:38:27,820 --> 03:38:29,820
as they are contacted by... That's how

5022
03:38:29,820 --> 03:38:31,820
they work. But you've

5023
03:38:31,820 --> 03:38:33,820
had aviators that have seen

5024
03:38:33,820 --> 03:38:35,820
metallic disks within a few hundred feet.

5025
03:38:35,820 --> 03:38:37,820
And I

5026
03:38:37,820 --> 03:38:39,820
lay this out, there's I think

5027
03:38:39,820 --> 03:38:41,820
at least 30 cases where multiple

5028
03:38:41,820 --> 03:38:43,820
credible witnesses, police officers,

5029
03:38:43,820 --> 03:38:45,820
pilots, engineers, have seen these

5030
03:38:45,820 --> 03:38:47,820
objects a hundred feet away.

5031
03:38:47,820 --> 03:38:49,820
And they all just happen to look like

5032
03:38:49,820 --> 03:38:51,820
the gimbal and the Iraq.

5033
03:38:51,820 --> 03:38:53,820
They're evasive, but not

5034
03:38:53,820 --> 03:38:55,820
when there's no camera available.

5035
03:38:55,820 --> 03:38:57,820
They're evasive, but they appear a hundred

5036
03:38:57,820 --> 03:38:59,820
feet away, where you would be able to get wonderful

5037
03:38:59,820 --> 03:39:01,820
4K video if you had your camera

5038
03:39:01,820 --> 03:39:03,820
with you. They're not really evasive.

5039
03:39:03,820 --> 03:39:05,820
They're just evading cameras.

5040
03:39:05,820 --> 03:39:07,820
This is the flaw in your analytic

5041
03:39:07,820 --> 03:39:09,820
approach.

5042
03:39:09,820 --> 03:39:11,820
I wish

5043
03:39:11,820 --> 03:39:13,820
you took some time to read through

5044
03:39:13,820 --> 03:39:15,820
the actual... And I'm happy to send you

5045
03:39:15,820 --> 03:39:17,820
the most compelling ones, and

5046
03:39:17,820 --> 03:39:19,820
you have to read through the

5047
03:39:19,820 --> 03:39:21,820
most compelling reports that are out there.

5048
03:39:21,820 --> 03:39:23,820
Multi-witness within several hundred

5049
03:39:23,820 --> 03:39:25,820
feet.

5050
03:39:25,820 --> 03:39:27,820
Go ahead, that's fine. I'm just telling you

5051
03:39:27,820 --> 03:39:29,820
that's my analytic basis, that's what I

5052
03:39:29,820 --> 03:39:31,820
go off. Yeah, your analytic basis is

5053
03:39:31,820 --> 03:39:33,820
stories from 70, 80 years ago.

5054
03:39:33,820 --> 03:39:35,820
It's not really very useful.

5055
03:39:39,820 --> 03:39:41,820
I would also say

5056
03:39:41,820 --> 03:39:43,820
if we're talking about things that travel

5057
03:39:43,820 --> 03:39:45,820
the speed of light, or do any of the things that seem

5058
03:39:45,820 --> 03:39:47,820
to break our conventional

5059
03:39:47,820 --> 03:39:49,820
physics,

5060
03:39:49,820 --> 03:39:51,820
and then you accept any of these stories

5061
03:39:51,820 --> 03:39:53,820
around consciousness, they probably

5062
03:39:53,820 --> 03:39:55,820
know how to evade

5063
03:39:55,820 --> 03:39:57,820
perception on more of a

5064
03:39:57,820 --> 03:39:59,820
root level than we're able

5065
03:39:59,820 --> 03:40:01,820
to even understand.

5066
03:40:01,820 --> 03:40:03,820
And we're getting away from the nuts and bolts

5067
03:40:03,820 --> 03:40:05,820
here. This is kind of like

5068
03:40:05,820 --> 03:40:07,820
speculative. I wouldn't say

5069
03:40:07,820 --> 03:40:09,820
it's getting away from nuts and bolts, it just

5070
03:40:09,820 --> 03:40:11,820
goes towards the Arthur C. Clarke quote that

5071
03:40:11,820 --> 03:40:13,820
any sufficiently advanced technology appears

5072
03:40:13,820 --> 03:40:15,820
to be magic. Can you demonstrate

5073
03:40:15,820 --> 03:40:17,820
that is happening though?

5074
03:40:17,820 --> 03:40:19,820
Demonstrate what is happening.

5075
03:40:19,820 --> 03:40:21,820
Any of what you just said.

5076
03:40:21,820 --> 03:40:23,820
They're detecting cameras and avoiding

5077
03:40:23,820 --> 03:40:25,820
them.

5078
03:40:25,820 --> 03:40:27,820
All good science is the

5079
03:40:27,820 --> 03:40:29,820
interplay between experimentation

5080
03:40:29,820 --> 03:40:31,820
and theory. And I would bucket in

5081
03:40:31,820 --> 03:40:33,820
anomalies with experimentation

5082
03:40:33,820 --> 03:40:35,820
where you see these observable things.

5083
03:40:35,820 --> 03:40:37,820
You can't just snap them to grid

5084
03:40:37,820 --> 03:40:39,820
on present theory of, you know,

5085
03:40:39,820 --> 03:40:41,820
this can't exist because of present physical

5086
03:40:41,820 --> 03:40:43,820
models. That would have, you know,

5087
03:40:43,820 --> 03:40:45,820
stagnated science in all sorts

5088
03:40:45,820 --> 03:40:47,820
of cases in the past, whether it's black

5089
03:40:47,820 --> 03:40:49,820
body radiation or the orbit of

5090
03:40:49,820 --> 03:40:51,820
Mercury, which were both very anomalous.

5091
03:40:51,820 --> 03:40:53,820
And so in this case, you're seeing this anomalous thing.

5092
03:40:53,820 --> 03:40:55,820
It's actually somewhat repeatable with two things.

5093
03:40:55,820 --> 03:40:57,820
Nuclear and

5094
03:40:57,820 --> 03:40:59,820
consciousness. And it's kind of on us to

5095
03:40:59,820 --> 03:41:01,820
theorize and we could, again, snap it back

5096
03:41:01,820 --> 03:41:03,820
to the grid of like general relativity

5097
03:41:03,820 --> 03:41:05,820
and say it's impossible. But

5098
03:41:05,820 --> 03:41:07,820
usually that loses the snapping

5099
03:41:07,820 --> 03:41:09,820
back to the grid and maybe, you know,

5100
03:41:09,820 --> 03:41:11,820
the person, you know,

5101
03:41:11,820 --> 03:41:13,820
making theories around this thing is

5102
03:41:13,820 --> 03:41:15,820
a heretic of the present, but they're often

5103
03:41:15,820 --> 03:41:17,820
vindicated in the future as kind of

5104
03:41:17,820 --> 03:41:19,820
the hero of the future, scientifically

5105
03:41:19,820 --> 03:41:21,820
speaking. So I'd say if you're looking at it

5106
03:41:21,820 --> 03:41:23,820
from like a meta-scientific,

5107
03:41:23,820 --> 03:41:25,820
you know, Thomas Kuhnian

5108
03:41:25,820 --> 03:41:27,820
model of like the structure of scientific

5109
03:41:27,820 --> 03:41:29,820
revolutions, you'd probably bet

5110
03:41:29,820 --> 03:41:31,820
on the anomaly. You wouldn't bet on the present

5111
03:41:31,820 --> 03:41:33,820
physics model. The present physics model

5112
03:41:33,820 --> 03:41:35,820
always goes away. You can't just bet

5113
03:41:35,820 --> 03:41:37,820
on every single anomaly out there and expect

5114
03:41:37,820 --> 03:41:39,820
them all to be true. It's not like, you know, they laugh

5115
03:41:39,820 --> 03:41:41,820
at you and you're right. It's

5116
03:41:41,820 --> 03:41:43,820
the most things that are weird

5117
03:41:43,820 --> 03:41:45,820
and aren't actually real. There are very few

5118
03:41:45,820 --> 03:41:47,820
of them that actually turn out to be interesting

5119
03:41:47,820 --> 03:41:49,820
things. And those are things that where we do have repeatable

5120
03:41:49,820 --> 03:41:51,820
and measurable data like

5121
03:41:51,820 --> 03:41:53,820
the orbit of Mercury and things like that.

5122
03:41:53,820 --> 03:41:55,820
We don't have that.

5123
03:41:55,820 --> 03:41:57,820
You know, we've got an accumulation of anecdotes

5124
03:41:57,820 --> 03:41:59,820
and accumulation of stories

5125
03:41:59,820 --> 03:42:01,820
and we've got lots and lots of them. It seems

5126
03:42:01,820 --> 03:42:03,820
compelling. It seems compelling

5127
03:42:03,820 --> 03:42:05,820
because you just

5128
03:42:05,820 --> 03:42:07,820
gather together all the ones that seem similar.

5129
03:42:07,820 --> 03:42:09,820
Here are all the ones from nuclear power stations.

5130
03:42:09,820 --> 03:42:11,820
Here are all the ones that show like shiny

5131
03:42:11,820 --> 03:42:13,820
disks. So yes, of course they're

5132
03:42:13,820 --> 03:42:15,820
remarkably consistent because you

5133
03:42:15,820 --> 03:42:17,820
gather them together. Do some actual

5134
03:42:17,820 --> 03:42:19,820
statistical analysis on this and see what

5135
03:42:19,820 --> 03:42:21,820
comes out.

5136
03:42:21,820 --> 03:42:23,820
Yeah, go for it. Yeah.

5137
03:42:23,820 --> 03:42:25,820
Go ahead.

5138
03:42:25,820 --> 03:42:27,820
No, you go. You go.

5139
03:42:27,820 --> 03:42:29,820
Battelle put out a very, very

5140
03:42:29,820 --> 03:42:31,820
deep analysis

5141
03:42:31,820 --> 03:42:33,820
of the 1947

5142
03:42:33,820 --> 03:42:35,820
and 1952

5143
03:42:35,820 --> 03:42:37,820
sightings. And guess what?

5144
03:42:37,820 --> 03:42:39,820
Fascinating.

5145
03:42:39,820 --> 03:42:41,820
33% of the most

5146
03:42:41,820 --> 03:42:43,820
credible sightings were unknown.

5147
03:42:43,820 --> 03:42:45,820
And those are ones that had enough data to

5148
03:42:45,820 --> 03:42:47,820
be analyzed.

5149
03:42:47,820 --> 03:42:49,820
Sure, but we have no idea what they consider to be

5150
03:42:49,820 --> 03:42:51,820
enough data. And we don't know any of those cases.

5151
03:42:51,820 --> 03:42:53,820
And it was like

5152
03:42:53,820 --> 03:42:55,820
80 years ago. It's

5153
03:42:55,820 --> 03:42:57,820
useless.

5154
03:42:57,820 --> 03:42:59,820
And then Edward J. Ruppelt

5155
03:42:59,820 --> 03:43:01,820
also

5156
03:43:01,820 --> 03:43:03,820
did a study for

5157
03:43:03,820 --> 03:43:05,820
pre-Blue Book, Sine and Grudge. And

5158
03:43:05,820 --> 03:43:07,820
it's the same thing. It was like 70%

5159
03:43:07,820 --> 03:43:09,820
of these cases show up around nuclear. That's the

5160
03:43:09,820 --> 03:43:11,820
reason Battelle was involved in the first place

5161
03:43:11,820 --> 03:43:13,820
because they're managing all this nuclear stuff

5162
03:43:13,820 --> 03:43:15,820
to begin with. And then you have

5163
03:43:15,820 --> 03:43:17,820
again, my editor is

5164
03:43:17,820 --> 03:43:19,820
going to kill me because I wanted to keep this kind of targeted.

5165
03:43:19,820 --> 03:43:21,820
But

5166
03:43:21,820 --> 03:43:23,820
we have 167 guys

5167
03:43:23,820 --> 03:43:25,820
with cue clearances

5168
03:43:25,820 --> 03:43:27,820
who have no reason, they haven't made

5169
03:43:27,820 --> 03:43:29,820
a dime from this. They're

5170
03:43:29,820 --> 03:43:31,820
sort of, they've been castigated

5171
03:43:31,820 --> 03:43:33,820
and shamed

5172
03:43:33,820 --> 03:43:35,820
and often demoted. If they sneeze, they have to report it.

5173
03:43:35,820 --> 03:43:37,820
Exactly, they have to report it

5174
03:43:37,820 --> 03:43:39,820
if they're on the personal

5175
03:43:39,820 --> 03:43:41,820
reliability program.

5176
03:43:41,820 --> 03:43:43,820
And that has to be an extremely

5177
03:43:43,820 --> 03:43:45,820
depressed number. That 167

5178
03:43:45,820 --> 03:43:47,820
has to actually be

5179
03:43:47,820 --> 03:43:49,820
10,700

5180
03:43:49,820 --> 03:43:51,820
or something. You really have to

5181
03:43:51,820 --> 03:43:53,820
multiply that by a ton.

5182
03:43:53,820 --> 03:43:55,820
How many people have cue clearance?

5183
03:43:55,820 --> 03:43:57,820
And how many of them are in positions where they have

5184
03:43:57,820 --> 03:43:59,820
to report things regardless?

5185
03:43:59,820 --> 03:44:01,820
And so they end up reporting a whole bunch

5186
03:44:01,820 --> 03:44:03,820
more stuff than your regular guy at Walmart

5187
03:44:03,820 --> 03:44:05,820
would report. That is a

5188
03:44:05,820 --> 03:44:07,820
very high subset of people

5189
03:44:07,820 --> 03:44:09,820
with cue clearance. And it's not just people

5190
03:44:09,820 --> 03:44:11,820
seeing these things

5191
03:44:11,820 --> 03:44:13,820
in distant places in the sky because of

5192
03:44:13,820 --> 03:44:15,820
hypervigilance around nuclear assets,

5193
03:44:15,820 --> 03:44:17,820
it's them shutting down the power

5194
03:44:17,820 --> 03:44:19,820
around these nuclear

5195
03:44:19,820 --> 03:44:21,820
sites, disarming the nukes themselves

5196
03:44:21,820 --> 03:44:23,820
and in certain cases these guys

5197
03:44:23,820 --> 03:44:25,820
claim to board crafts and

5198
03:44:25,820 --> 03:44:27,820
have things implanted inside them.

5199
03:44:27,820 --> 03:44:29,820
Well, it

5200
03:44:29,820 --> 03:44:31,820
seems a bit implausible to me.

5201
03:44:31,820 --> 03:44:33,820
You want those guys to control the nuclear button if they're all insane?

5202
03:44:33,820 --> 03:44:35,820
They're not all insane,

5203
03:44:35,820 --> 03:44:37,820
they're just normal people. They're regular people.

5204
03:44:37,820 --> 03:44:39,820
They have normal human failings.

5205
03:44:39,820 --> 03:44:41,820
But come on, I mean,

5206
03:44:41,820 --> 03:44:43,820
if a guy was guarding

5207
03:44:43,820 --> 03:44:45,820
these nuclear assets and claimed

5208
03:44:45,820 --> 03:44:47,820
these things and it wasn't repeatable,

5209
03:44:47,820 --> 03:44:49,820
like I just interviewed a guy named Mario Woods,

5210
03:44:49,820 --> 03:44:51,820
1977 Ellsworth Air Force Base

5211
03:44:51,820 --> 03:44:53,820
South Dakota,

5212
03:44:53,820 --> 03:44:55,820
boarded a craft or whatever

5213
03:44:55,820 --> 03:44:57,820
and woke up nine

5214
03:44:57,820 --> 03:44:59,820
miles in Lake

5215
03:44:59,820 --> 03:45:01,820
Newell away

5216
03:45:01,820 --> 03:45:03,820
from the base and has marks

5217
03:45:03,820 --> 03:45:05,820
on his body and

5218
03:45:05,820 --> 03:45:07,820
it was just a really crazy

5219
03:45:07,820 --> 03:45:09,820
experience. And he had his cue clearance

5220
03:45:09,820 --> 03:45:11,820
and retained it and worked at Sandia

5221
03:45:11,820 --> 03:45:13,820
and all sorts of other DOE labs,

5222
03:45:13,820 --> 03:45:15,820
I think Oak Ridge, for another 20

5223
03:45:15,820 --> 03:45:17,820
years. If you're like a higher

5224
03:45:17,820 --> 03:45:19,820
up person in

5225
03:45:19,820 --> 03:45:21,820
the DOE and you see that

5226
03:45:21,820 --> 03:45:23,820
and you have this one

5227
03:45:23,820 --> 03:45:25,820
guy claiming this crazy shit,

5228
03:45:25,820 --> 03:45:27,820
why would you continue to hire

5229
03:45:27,820 --> 03:45:29,820
him for the next 20 years

5230
03:45:29,820 --> 03:45:31,820
unless that was actually just this repeatable

5231
03:45:31,820 --> 03:45:33,820
thing happening to a lot of people and you were

5232
03:45:33,820 --> 03:45:35,820
hyper aware of the phenomena overall.

5233
03:45:35,820 --> 03:45:37,820
And you didn't blame the guy and you

5234
03:45:37,820 --> 03:45:39,820
realized he was totally lucid and mentally

5235
03:45:39,820 --> 03:45:41,820
sound. I wouldn't let that guy near

5236
03:45:41,820 --> 03:45:43,820
my nuclear acid. If he was the one guy,

5237
03:45:43,820 --> 03:45:45,820
if he was just the one guy.

5238
03:45:45,820 --> 03:45:47,820
He's not like he had his finger on

5239
03:45:47,820 --> 03:45:49,820
the bottom and he could launch things. He was

5240
03:45:49,820 --> 03:45:51,820
someone who worked there, he had a cue clearance

5241
03:45:51,820 --> 03:45:53,820
and people were like, David Grush

5242
03:45:53,820 --> 03:45:55,820
has a psychotic episode

5243
03:45:55,820 --> 03:45:57,820
and was voluntarily hospitalized and he

5244
03:45:57,820 --> 03:45:59,820
kept his clearance because people, just

5245
03:45:59,820 --> 03:46:01,820
because they have episodes

5246
03:46:01,820 --> 03:46:03,820
doesn't mean you automatically lose

5247
03:46:03,820 --> 03:46:05,820
your... He didn't have a psychotic episode

5248
03:46:05,820 --> 03:46:07,820
at all and he had too much to drink

5249
03:46:07,820 --> 03:46:09,820
one night and his buddy next to him was blown

5250
03:46:09,820 --> 03:46:11,820
up in war because of that.

5251
03:46:11,820 --> 03:46:13,820
PTSD, so it's

5252
03:46:13,820 --> 03:46:15,820
arguable.

5253
03:46:15,820 --> 03:46:17,820
But I'm just saying you don't lose your

5254
03:46:17,820 --> 03:46:19,820
clearance just because

5255
03:46:19,820 --> 03:46:21,820
one thing happened to you. If you get

5256
03:46:21,820 --> 03:46:23,820
cleared by a doctor later, you go to therapy

5257
03:46:23,820 --> 03:46:25,820
whatever, you can carry on working. Obviously

5258
03:46:25,820 --> 03:46:27,820
we don't know the details of that,

5259
03:46:27,820 --> 03:46:29,820
you know, HIPAA and everything.

5260
03:46:29,820 --> 03:46:31,820
I don't know if he volunteered exactly

5261
03:46:31,820 --> 03:46:33,820
what happened. Did he just go back

5262
03:46:33,820 --> 03:46:35,820
to work the next day and say, I saw aliens?

5263
03:46:35,820 --> 03:46:37,820
No, there was a very

5264
03:46:37,820 --> 03:46:39,820
clear protocol he underwent

5265
03:46:39,820 --> 03:46:41,820
due to

5266
03:46:41,820 --> 03:46:43,820
obviously the Air Force

5267
03:46:43,820 --> 03:46:45,820
having seen this before. They

5268
03:46:45,820 --> 03:46:47,820
checked him for certain things.

5269
03:46:47,820 --> 03:46:49,820
I'll just say

5270
03:46:49,820 --> 03:46:51,820
in the post

5271
03:46:51,820 --> 03:46:53,820
global war on terror era,

5272
03:46:53,820 --> 03:46:55,820
their PTS has

5273
03:46:55,820 --> 03:46:57,820
been a significant issue and yes

5274
03:46:57,820 --> 03:46:59,820
Jesse's correct that military

5275
03:46:59,820 --> 03:47:01,820
services have had to deal with

5276
03:47:01,820 --> 03:47:03,820
this a lot.

5277
03:47:03,820 --> 03:47:05,820
And there are protocols indeed, Jesse's

5278
03:47:05,820 --> 03:47:07,820
correct about that, that had

5279
03:47:07,820 --> 03:47:09,820
to be followed for Grush to

5280
03:47:09,820 --> 03:47:11,820
retain his clearance. But I don't

5281
03:47:11,820 --> 03:47:13,820
want to get into personal stuff. Mick, can I just quickly

5282
03:47:13,820 --> 03:47:15,820
I will shut up after this.

5283
03:47:15,820 --> 03:47:17,820
Mick, can I pin you down? The experts

5284
03:47:17,820 --> 03:47:19,820
have spoken, they say glare is

5285
03:47:19,820 --> 03:47:21,820
not a thing, they say what we're seeing in those

5286
03:47:21,820 --> 03:47:23,820
engines is what's called blooming

5287
03:47:23,820 --> 03:47:25,820
which is a well known artifact

5288
03:47:25,820 --> 03:47:27,820
in infrared technology and they said

5289
03:47:27,820 --> 03:47:29,820
and you know exactly what I'm talking about,

5290
03:47:29,820 --> 03:47:31,820
the credentials are impeccable.

5291
03:47:31,820 --> 03:47:33,820
Blooming would not have

5292
03:47:33,820 --> 03:47:35,820
resulted in that rotation.

5293
03:47:35,820 --> 03:47:37,820
What's the theory for the

5294
03:47:37,820 --> 03:47:39,820
gimbal video? I think

5295
03:47:39,820 --> 03:47:41,820
there's two possibilities, well there's three possibilities.

5296
03:47:41,820 --> 03:47:43,820
One is a real craft that's rotating.

5297
03:47:43,820 --> 03:47:45,820
One is that what I suggested is correct

5298
03:47:45,820 --> 03:47:47,820
then there's some kind of obstacle artifact that happens

5299
03:47:47,820 --> 03:47:49,820
before the sensor. And the other one

5300
03:47:49,820 --> 03:47:51,820
is like glare.

5301
03:47:51,820 --> 03:47:53,820
And the other one

5302
03:47:53,820 --> 03:47:55,820
you said you'd shut up Marek.

5303
03:47:55,820 --> 03:47:57,820
Then the third one

5304
03:47:57,820 --> 03:47:59,820
is that the derotation happens after

5305
03:47:59,820 --> 03:48:01,820
the sensor, like it's a digital derotation

5306
03:48:01,820 --> 03:48:03,820
which is something that's

5307
03:48:03,820 --> 03:48:05,820
in the patent.

5308
03:48:05,820 --> 03:48:07,820
So I don't know which one of those it is. I do know

5309
03:48:07,820 --> 03:48:09,820
that it looks like it's an optical artifact

5310
03:48:09,820 --> 03:48:11,820
that's rotating because of derotation

5311
03:48:11,820 --> 03:48:13,820
because of all the various observables that I

5312
03:48:13,820 --> 03:48:15,820
list in my video

5313
03:48:15,820 --> 03:48:17,820
and one of the experts says

5314
03:48:17,820 --> 03:48:19,820
that he thought I was right but for the wrong

5315
03:48:19,820 --> 03:48:21,820
reason. Another one said that

5316
03:48:21,820 --> 03:48:23,820
it looked like an SR-71, well they both said that actually.

5317
03:48:23,820 --> 03:48:25,820
So you know, I think perhaps

5318
03:48:25,820 --> 03:48:27,820
we need to talk to these experts in a bit more detail.

5319
03:48:27,820 --> 03:48:29,820
Drill down into this.

5320
03:48:29,820 --> 03:48:31,820
And for the record

5321
03:48:31,820 --> 03:48:33,820
the one who said you were right, he actually did not say

5322
03:48:33,820 --> 03:48:35,820
that, let's be clear, and I'll put up those emails

5323
03:48:35,820 --> 03:48:37,820
happily after this and we can have

5324
03:48:37,820 --> 03:48:39,820
that discussion. You know that's not true.

5325
03:48:39,820 --> 03:48:41,820
He said I think Mick is

5326
03:48:41,820 --> 03:48:43,820
right but for the wrong reason.

5327
03:48:43,820 --> 03:48:45,820
I don't think that's correct and I

5328
03:48:45,820 --> 03:48:47,820
put that out there.

5329
03:48:47,820 --> 03:48:49,820
Sure, well I'll check him out. I could be wrong too

5330
03:48:49,820 --> 03:48:51,820
but that's how I recall it. Please do

5331
03:48:51,820 --> 03:48:53,820
because everything he described was

5332
03:48:53,820 --> 03:48:55,820
an internal thing. It's not on the glass.

5333
03:48:55,820 --> 03:48:57,820
Anyway, bottom

5334
03:48:57,820 --> 03:48:59,820
line is the experts have

5335
03:48:59,820 --> 03:49:01,820
basically ruled it. Arrow is not

5336
03:49:01,820 --> 03:49:03,820
Arrow is not

5337
03:49:03,820 --> 03:49:05,820
the patent does the same thing.

5338
03:49:05,820 --> 03:49:07,820
You know, those experts

5339
03:49:07,820 --> 03:49:09,820
did not give a definite

5340
03:49:09,820 --> 03:49:11,820
answer. They gave an opinion

5341
03:49:11,820 --> 03:49:13,820
based on limited data. The one

5342
03:49:13,820 --> 03:49:15,820
I read the email to you

5343
03:49:15,820 --> 03:49:17,820
explicitly ruled it out

5344
03:49:17,820 --> 03:49:19,820
He explicitly said this was

5345
03:49:19,820 --> 03:49:21,820
an initial impression based on limited

5346
03:49:21,820 --> 03:49:23,820
data and that it was not

5347
03:49:23,820 --> 03:49:25,820
intended to be something, it wasn't even something

5348
03:49:25,820 --> 03:49:27,820
that he wanted to share. He didn't want his emails

5349
03:49:27,820 --> 03:49:29,820
to be shared and

5350
03:49:29,820 --> 03:49:31,820
he didn't come to an actual conclusion. I did it anonymously

5351
03:49:31,820 --> 03:49:33,820
because I think it's important to hear those voices.

5352
03:49:33,820 --> 03:49:35,820
He didn't want to share it

5353
03:49:35,820 --> 03:49:37,820
anyway. Did you get permission

5354
03:49:37,820 --> 03:49:39,820
from him to share those emails? I did not. I put

5355
03:49:39,820 --> 03:49:41,820
it out anonymously, anonymized it because

5356
03:49:41,820 --> 03:49:43,820
I think it's important for people to see what the

5357
03:49:43,820 --> 03:49:45,820
world's leading experts say about this

5358
03:49:45,820 --> 03:49:47,820
footage. I asked him for permission

5359
03:49:47,820 --> 03:49:49,820
because I wanted to share it myself and he said no

5360
03:49:49,820 --> 03:49:51,820
and the other one didn't reply.

5361
03:49:51,820 --> 03:49:53,820
I already heard that.

5362
03:49:53,820 --> 03:49:55,820
Does it bother you that Aero does

5363
03:49:55,820 --> 03:49:57,820
not endorse your theory?

5364
03:49:57,820 --> 03:49:59,820
No, I don't think they've got round to it yet.

5365
03:49:59,820 --> 03:50:01,820
It's the most recognizable

5366
03:50:01,820 --> 03:50:03,820
footage of all time.

5367
03:50:03,820 --> 03:50:05,820
They did Aguadilla, which

5368
03:50:05,820 --> 03:50:07,820
is just one that existed

5369
03:50:07,820 --> 03:50:09,820
before that. I think the

5370
03:50:09,820 --> 03:50:11,820
fraction of people who see

5371
03:50:11,820 --> 03:50:13,820
Aguadilla come up all

5372
03:50:13,820 --> 03:50:15,820
the time. It's a very famous UFO video

5373
03:50:15,820 --> 03:50:17,820
and they

5374
03:50:17,820 --> 03:50:19,820
know you agree with them on that one.

5375
03:50:19,820 --> 03:50:21,820
I do.

5376
03:50:21,820 --> 03:50:23,820
I know you've talked to

5377
03:50:23,820 --> 03:50:25,820
Kirkpatrick and he told you some ridiculous

5378
03:50:25,820 --> 03:50:27,820
interpretation

5379
03:50:27,820 --> 03:50:29,820
off the top of his head. Unbelievable.

5380
03:50:29,820 --> 03:50:31,820
He said it twice.

5381
03:50:31,820 --> 03:50:33,820
It's

5382
03:50:33,820 --> 03:50:35,820
disappointing that

5383
03:50:35,820 --> 03:50:37,820
we're not getting more information from Aero

5384
03:50:37,820 --> 03:50:39,820
but we haven't

5385
03:50:39,820 --> 03:50:41,820
got the official word yet

5386
03:50:41,820 --> 03:50:43,820
from them. Maybe we can leave it at

5387
03:50:43,820 --> 03:50:45,820
let's hope Kozlowski is true to his word and he

5388
03:50:45,820 --> 03:50:47,820
can, whatever bureaucratic

5389
03:50:47,820 --> 03:50:49,820
classic issues he has

5390
03:50:49,820 --> 03:50:51,820
to overcome to get

5391
03:50:51,820 --> 03:50:53,820
the really anomalous stuff that

5392
03:50:53,820 --> 03:50:55,820
he said he is stumped by, the

5393
03:50:55,820 --> 03:50:57,820
quote, true anomalies, maybe we can leave

5394
03:50:57,820 --> 03:50:59,820
it here, let's hope.

5395
03:50:59,820 --> 03:51:01,820
Let's get that stuff out there.

5396
03:51:01,820 --> 03:51:03,820
Let's figure this out.

5397
03:51:03,820 --> 03:51:05,820
Why doesn't someone leak something that's really good?

5398
03:51:05,820 --> 03:51:07,820
Why are we getting these crappy egg videos and these

5399
03:51:07,820 --> 03:51:09,820
bouncy objects?

5400
03:51:09,820 --> 03:51:11,820
Leak the 4K stuff, please.

5401
03:51:11,820 --> 03:51:13,820
Well, I think we can all, let's end on that

5402
03:51:13,820 --> 03:51:15,820
note of collegiality

5403
03:51:15,820 --> 03:51:17,820
between us.

5404
03:51:17,820 --> 03:51:19,820
We would all like to see better footage.

5405
03:51:19,820 --> 03:51:21,820
Indeed.

5406
03:51:21,820 --> 03:51:23,820
No matter what our takes are on the existing record

5407
03:51:23,820 --> 03:51:25,820
and what we currently have.

5408
03:51:25,820 --> 03:51:27,820
Mick, Merrick,

5409
03:51:27,820 --> 03:51:29,820
appreciate you guys. We're going to put this out

5410
03:51:29,820 --> 03:51:31,820
pretty soon and just

5411
03:51:31,820 --> 03:51:33,820
tag it onto our finished video.

5412
03:51:33,820 --> 03:51:35,820
Sounds good.

5413
03:51:35,820 --> 03:51:37,820
Cool. Thanks again, guys. Appreciate it.

5414
03:51:37,820 --> 03:51:39,820
Thank you.

5415
03:51:39,820 --> 03:51:41,820
Later.

5416
03:51:43,820 --> 03:51:45,820
Thank you.
