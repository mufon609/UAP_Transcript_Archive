1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
I think when you play a meaningful part in bringing about the death of over a hundred

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,480
thousand people and the injury of a comparable number, you don't think of that with ease.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,120
The whole point of the doomsday machine is lost if you keep it a secret.

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,520
Why didn't you tell the world, eh?

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,320
On the 19th of May 1953, something extraordinary happened in the Nevada desert.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:40,920
A new kind of nuclear bomb, codenamed Harry, was detonated at the Nevada test site.

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,840
It unleashed 32 kilotons of energy, twice the power dropped on Hiroshima.

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,440
The military at the time was running Operation Upshot Knothole, a series of nuclear tests

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,720
to study how the blasts affected homes, buildings, and infrastructure.

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,240
But of the dozens of nuclear devices used, it seemed that Harry, which caused the largest

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,320
blast, might have had an unintended side effect.

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,720
One of the engineers on site studying all of this data was a decorated World War II

13
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,000
veteran named Arthur Stancil.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,800
I can assure you that your name will not be used.

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,880
The man had been working as a consultant on blast effects of atom bombs when he was suddenly

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,360
ordered to report for a new mission.

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,920
Along with 15 other specialists, he was ordered to leave his belongings behind.

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,320
He was flown to Phoenix and transported on a bus with blacked out windows to a classified

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,720
location near Kingman, Arizona.

20
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,680
They were told a secret test vehicle had crashed.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,560
His job was to determine its impact velocity.

22
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,000
I accepted it was probably some United States government vehicle, a highly classified vehicle.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,160
In fact, if you were told it, that's what it was.

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,720
Under the floodlights, he saw the most exotic craft he had ever seen.

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,720
It looked like two deep saucers fused together, buried 20 inches in the sand.

26
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,480
It was roughly 30 feet in diameter, made of a dull brushed metal material.

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,720
It had no landing gear, no visible damage, and a small open hatch.

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,880
Inside a nearby tent, a number of four-foot-tall humanoid figures laid out on a table.

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,440
While all of this might sound unbelievable, more evidence of the Kingman crash surfaced recently.

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,840
Former intelligence official Chris Mellon revealed that this flying saucer had been

31
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,880
recovered and studied over the decades since its retrieval.

32
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,320
And Stancil himself was no random witness.

33
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,720
His record is impeccable.

34
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,760
He earned three Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star, and after the war began, he sustained a career

35
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,400
in physics and engineering at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,320
And a declassified report from Operation Upshot Null confirms Stancil was on-site for the

37
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,880
nuclear testing there.

38
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:14,640
But it's the name mentioned alongside Stancil's, the head of the Special Studies Department

39
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,200
at Wright-Patterson, who is much more of a mystery.

40
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,360
Dr. Eric Wang.

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,520
Unlike Stancil, Wang left almost no trace in public records.

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,320
Despite having his name endow a civil engineering research facility at the University of New

43
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,760
Mexico, any other details about what else he might have been doing in his super-secretive

44
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,120
career are nonexistent.

45
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,240
Attempts to verify his background lead to nothing.

46
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,400
No biographical details, no employment records, no published research.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,480
It was as if he had been erased from the records.

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,660
The mystery of Dr. Wang was picked up in the 1980s by UFO researcher William Steinman.

49
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,440
After months of searching, he finally found a clue, an obituary in an old issue of a mechanical

50
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,960
engineering magazine.

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:12,520
It turned out that Dr. Eric H. Wang, born in 1906, had originally come from Vienna.

52
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,160
In fact, he had graduated from Vienna Technical Institute, and there are suggestions that

53
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,280
he was a contemporary of Victor Schauberger, the man rumored to have developed a revolutionary

54
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,600
propulsion system, perhaps even conceptual flying saucers for the Nazis.

55
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,720
Steinman discovered that Wang immigrated to the U.S. before World War II, lectured at

56
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,600
the University of Cincinnati, and eventually became head of the Department of Special Studies

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,240
at Wright-Patterson.

58
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,560
In 1956, Wang's department was relocated to New Mexico, to the Sandia Laboratories

59
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Complex at Kirtland Air Force Base.

60
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,680
Steinman hit another dead end, and despite being warned off this trail, he took a different

61
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
approach.

62
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,040
He tracks down Dr. Wang's widow, Maria, and that's when things took a turn.

63
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,000
Maria Wang confirmed that her late husband had worked on classified projects at Wright-Patterson,

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,720
projects that involved technology not of this world.

65
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,680
She went even further, claiming that before his death, Eric had confided in her that the

66
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:22,880
U.S. government was studying recovered extraterrestrial craft.

67
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,540
But it was Maria's next revelation that was truly shocking.

68
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:33,060
She said that her husband had reported directly to Henry Kissinger.

69
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,820
Not only that, but that Kissinger was deeply involved in the flying saucer program, that

70
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,340
Kissinger had overseen much of her late husband's work, and that he had even visited their home

71
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,340
on occasion.

72
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,260
Yes, Henry Kissinger, the same Kissinger that's one of the most influential and controversial

73
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:56,380
figures in the 20th century.

74
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,300
Civil Security Advisor and Secretary of State under Presidents Nixon and Ford, the Harvard

75
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,700
academic, nuclear strategist, the man who won a Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating the

76
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:12,260
end of the Vietnam War, but who is also considered by many a war criminal.

77
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,100
That Henry Kissinger.

78
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,300
But if Maria Wang's claim was true, and Kissinger had worked with her husband before

79
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,580
he died in 1960, that would have placed Kissinger at the center of the most secretive program

80
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,060
in history before he had even entered public office.

81
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,180
That is a huge claim.

82
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,220
Is it possible that Henry Kissinger could have been overseeing the legacy UFO program?

83
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,700
There is no country in the world where it is conceivable that a man of my origins could

84
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:48,740
be standing here next to the president of the United States.

85
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,540
To understand that question, to investigate that claim, we need to take a few steps back.

86
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:00,660
Kissinger's rise to power and possible involvement in UFOs didn't just come through academia.

87
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,860
It started in Germany at the end of the war in Army intelligence.

88
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:31,900
In today's world, staying informed can feel like navigating a maze of headlines, each

89
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,740
with its own agenda.

90
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,220
That's why I started using Ground News, a tool designed for skeptics and truth seekers

91
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,980
like many in this community.

92
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:45,180
It's an app and website created by a former NASA engineer to tackle a problem we all face,

93
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,220
how the way we consume information can distort our understanding of the world.

94
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,780
Ground News brings transparency to the news.

95
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,420
It gathers coverage from over 50,000 sources worldwide, organizes stories by topic, and

96
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,180
even breaks down the bias and ownership behind each perspective.

97
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,380
With features like the bias distribution bar and factuality score, it's easy to see how

98
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,860
different outlets frame the same story.

99
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,700
For example, when I was researching those mysterious drone sightings, Ground News gave

100
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,420
me instant access to over 200 articles, helping me uncover every angle, from the facts to

101
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
the spin.

102
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,300
On the left, from Radar Online, Donald Trump says, shoot them down.

103
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,780
But on the right, News refers to it as a rogue loose nuke.

104
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,540
This just goes to show how different the framing can be based on where you're reading it.

105
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,980
So if you're tired of echo chambers and one-sided narratives, Ground News is your

106
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,080
ultimate tool for staying informed and making better decisions.

107
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,900
You can even follow your favorite topics and compare coverage to find the most credible

108
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,900
sources.

109
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,420
And for a limited time, you can get the same plan I use every day for nearly half the price.

110
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:56,540
Just go to ground.news slash Jesse Michaels or scan this QR code to save 40% off unlimited

111
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,820
access to their Vantage plan or gift it to someone you know and have more informed discussions

112
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,700
and hopefully chill out about those drones.

113
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,060
I only promote brands I vet, and I think you'll find them just as valuable as I do.

114
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,820
Ground News, the truth is out there.

115
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,900
You just need the right tools to find it.

116
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:20,980
Henry Kissinger was born in 1923 in Germany to a Jewish family and emigrated to the U.S.

117
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,340
in 1938 to escape Nazi persecution.

118
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,460
A gifted student, he was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War II, where he fought

119
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,380
in major battles, witnessed the liberation of a concentration camp, and was recruited

120
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,140
into the Counterintelligence Corp, or CIC.

121
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:43,540
The CIC, essentially the Army's FBI, played a key role in post-war Europe, securing Nazi

122
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,460
technology, hunting war criminals, and safeguarding military secrets.

123
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,660
It was deeply embedded in classified operations, including those connected to the Manhattan

124
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,660
Project.

125
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:00,260
It's also frequently mentioned in accounts of the Roswell crash and Majestic 12 leaks.

126
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,380
Kissinger was assigned to denazification efforts in occupied Germany.

127
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,000
His ability to communicate with locals and manage post-war chaos earned him a reputation

128
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
for confidence and diplomacy.

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,640
At just 22, he was entrusted with overseeing the entire town of Bensheim, a role which

130
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,000
provided him significant authority.

131
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,620
Later, he was assigned to work in Oberammergau, a picturesque town in the Bavarian Alps with

132
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,640
a lot of hidden significance.

133
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,880
Oberammergau happened to be the location of a secret weapons facility that had been dug

134
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,640
into the nearby mountains.

135
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,180
The Messerschmitt Design Branch had been moved there during the war, and they were responsible

136
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,640
for developing new jet-propelled planes and radio-controlled anti-aircraft missiles.

137
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,440
Henry Kissinger was one of the first officers to occupy the barracks there in 1945.

138
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,280
The timing of this assignment places Kissinger right in the middle of what was, in the eyes

139
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:00,860
of the U.S. Army, a treasure trove of Nazi rocket scientists and researchers.

140
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:06,800
Oberammergau was a crucial location for counterintelligence operations and the development of Operation

141
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Paperclip.

142
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,180
An American program which secretly imported 1,500-plus Nazi scientists.

143
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,620
In fact, the designer of the V-2 rocket and the future head of America's rocket program,

144
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,140
Wernher von Braun, had himself been apprehended by the Allies at Oberammergau.

145
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,140
You spend most of your time arguing with other people what the more important things are

146
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,140
and you don't get a job done.

147
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,800
He, along with some 400 other scientists, had been ordered to relocate to this area

148
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,700
by S.S. General Hans Komler.

149
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,980
Komler was infamous not only for his role in designing concentration camps but for overseeing

150
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,500
the Nazis' most advanced weapons programs.

151
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Alongside conventional rocketry and nuclear research, there were persistent rumors of

152
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,820
more exotic experiments going on at the time.

153
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,900
These experiments involved anti-gravity propulsion and flying saucer-like craft.

154
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,800
Victor Schauberger, an Austrian scientist, had allegedly developed a craft with an anti-gravity

155
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,380
effect that defied conventional physics.

156
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,780
According to historian Nick Cook's great book, The Hunt for Zero Point, CIC agents

157
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:19,140
interrogated Schauberger for nine months, fully aware of his most classified work.

158
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,460
They reportedly considered his discoveries more important than Nazi nuclear research itself.

159
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:30,180
The technology they secured, Cook suggests, had characteristics of a UFO, a craft that

160
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,180
seemingly defied the laws of physics.

161
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,700
After the war ended, another Army CIC agent, Neil Gersheimer, tricked Schauberger into

162
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,920
signing all of his work over to the United States.

163
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,020
The intellectual property around these exotic propulsion principles would end up at Brookhaven

164
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,260
National Labs in Long Island.

165
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,380
So this would infer that CIC agents of the same organization as Kissinger, in the same

166
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,900
field of operations, had already gathered the intelligence to understand this secret program.

167
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,880
If the CIC was actively collecting intelligence on this exotic technology, Kissinger would

168
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,160
have almost certainly been aware of it.

169
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,040
His assignment placed him at the center of the most sensitive intelligence gathering

170
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
area.

171
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,200
His credentials, relocation to Oberammergau, fluency in German, and his prior experience

172
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,520
in arresting and questioning ranking Nazis in Bensheim, all of this would lead any reasonable

173
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,600
person to believe that Kissinger was at least peripherally involved in managing the transition

174
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,480
of these Nazi scientists and their secrets into U.S. custody.

175
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,060
Whether Kissinger knew about experimental propulsion or otherworldly technology remains

176
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:44,140
speculative, but there is a distinct possibility that he could have been trusted with interrogating,

177
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,640
translating, and negotiating these secrets with Nazi scientists as part of their passage

178
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,820
to freedom in the United States.

179
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,120
All of this at least places Kissinger at the crime scene, so to speak.

180
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,360
So the question remains, what exactly did Henry Kissinger have to do with UFOs?

181
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,720
Henry Kissinger enrolled at Harvard in 1947, balancing the life of a dedicated student

182
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,960
with his ongoing ties to the counterintelligence corps.

183
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,040
While his peers saw him as a reclusive bookworm, he remained close with his army colleagues

184
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,400
and maintained an interest in intelligence operations.

185
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,700
He graduated in 1950 as the Cold War intensified.

186
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,640
The Korean War was underway.

187
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:31,080
The Soviets had tested their first atomic bomb, and China had fallen to communism.

188
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,600
Harvard played a prominent role in the co-mingling of the state intelligence community and academia.

189
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,880
James Conant, Harvard's president from 1933 to 1955, was a key figure in the Manhattan

190
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,280
Project, managing the delicate balance between scientists and the military.

191
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,600
A close ally of Oppenheimer's and Vannevar Bush's, he played a central role in shaping

192
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,480
America's atomic age, advising the Atomic Energy Commission and the Joint Research Development

193
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
Board.

194
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,160
Conant was second only to Oppenheimer as an advisor to the government on military and

195
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,880
civilian applications of nuclear technology.

196
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,260
He was a staunch Cold Warrior, setting Harvard's tone as an anti-communist stronghold.

197
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,920
Another connection to the hidden UFO history was Harvard's top astronomer, Dr. Donald

198
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,920
Menzel.

199
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:24,640
A leading UFO debunker in the 1950s, he insisted that all sightings had natural explanations.

200
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,360
But was he hiding something?

201
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,800
Recent claims by astrophysicist Dr. Beatrice Villarreal suggest Menzel ordered the destruction

202
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,120
of Harvard's astronomical photographic plates taken during the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO

203
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
flap.

204
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,160
He suddenly becomes the director of Harvard Observatory, and he destroys one side of the

205
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,600
photographic plates.

206
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,760
And he doesn't ask, as I understand from the record, he doesn't ask the astronomers to

207
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
select the plates.

208
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,400
No, he asked his secretary to go and throw away one side of the plates.

209
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:04,200
And there's a woman, Dorit Hofleit, that has been telling about the story in her memoirs.

210
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:10,760
And he started revenging on her later too, as I understood it, that she tried to protect

211
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
some of the plates.

212
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,120
He threw away a number of the blog books.

213
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,960
Adding to the mystery, Menzel was named in the MJ-12 documents as part of Truman's top-secret

214
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,280
UFO research panel in the late 1940s.

215
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,200
Now there are definite issues with the MJ-12 documents, but there are core truths in those

216
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,920
documents that have been corroborated by open source research.

217
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,460
More on that later.

218
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:40,920
Another key figure, physicist Louis Brandscombe, earned his PhD from Harvard in 1949 and played

219
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,800
a crucial role in the 1960s Condon Committee, which dismissed UFOs as scientifically insignificant.

220
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,520
As director of the National Bureau of Standards, Brandscombe allegedly offered committee chair

221
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,140
Edward Condon a deal, helped bury the UFO question and get your security clearance back.

222
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,480
There was a close relationship between the institutions of state power and Harvard, hidden

223
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,560
or not.

224
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,200
For Harvard and Kissinger, serving the Cold War machine, whether through the Department

225
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,900
of Defense or the CIA, was a patriotic duty.

226
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,180
How might this have affected the hidden history?

227
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,860
Well potentially, any crash retrievals or advanced physics would have been tightly controlled

228
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,980
under Cold War priorities.

229
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,580
Secrecy was not just about preventing public panic, it was also about staying ahead in

230
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,340
an existential battle with the Soviet Union.

231
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:33,500
And while the Cold War never erupted into direct global conflict, it was still a war.

232
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,720
Millions died in its proxy battles.

233
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,340
For those shaping policy, it was just as existential as the fight against Nazis, only

234
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,040
now with the added threat of weapons capable of ending civilization itself.

235
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,800
For Kissinger, the apocalyptic stakes of the Cold War shaped his early career.

236
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,860
Neil Ferguson's great biography highlights his deep interest in psychological warfare,

237
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,600
the art of using propaganda, disinformation, and psyops to manipulate adversaries and allies

238
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
alike.

239
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,080
In the 1950s, this meant undermining the Soviets without direct confrontation.

240
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,680
Kissinger didn't just theorize, he put these theories into practice.

241
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,520
He authored reports on psychological warfare, and with his mentor William Eliot, launched

242
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,920
a series of international seminars at Harvard.

243
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,600
These gatherings, backed by the intelligence community, aimed to cultivate foreign intellectuals

244
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,920
as allies of American influence.

245
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,560
At the same time, Kissinger maintained direct ties to the CIA, including contact with its

246
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,360
chief Alan Dulles.

247
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,160
So his transition from military intelligence to academia wasn't a break, it was a continuation.

248
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,520
But Kissinger's influence extended beyond Harvard.

249
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,800
In 1951, 1952, and again in 1955, he worked as a consultant for the Psychological Strategy

250
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,840
Board and its successor, the Operations Coordinating Board.

251
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,760
These high-level programs launched by Truman were designed to unify psychological warfare

252
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,200
efforts across U.S. agencies.

253
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,160
A declassified CIA document reveals the Psychological Strategy Board's core mission, winning hearts

254
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,840
and minds through strategic influence.

255
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,740
More crucially, it highlights how only a select few were deemed capable of staffing this new

256
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,440
psychological warfare oversight body, whether they were pulled from existing agencies or

257
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,640
recruited from outside the government.

258
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,200
Kissinger, it seems, was one of them.

259
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,360
The Psychological Strategy Board, or PSB, also has strong connections to the hidden

260
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
history of UFOs.

261
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,380
Philip J. Corso was a member, another CIC agent who went into government.

262
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,600
He was on the staff of Eisenhower's National Security Council and eventually became the

263
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,560
chief of the Pentagon's Foreign Technology Desk in Army Research and Development.

264
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,940
Corso went on to claim in his book, The Day After Roswell, that alien tech had been recovered

265
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,360
and reverse-engineered from crash retrieval programs.

266
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,840
Another PSB figure, Douglas Jackson, was special assistant to the president under Eisenhower.

267
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,440
He served as liaison between the CIA and the Pentagon.

268
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,880
By 1960, Jackson had moved into publishing, becoming head of Life magazine.

269
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,120
After Kennedy was assassinated, Life acquired the Zapruder film, the clearest footage of

270
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,800
the assassination.

271
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,480
But instead of releasing it in full, they only published black and white stills with

272
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,840
certain key frames missing.

273
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,120
The moving footage was withheld for over a decade.

274
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,360
Jackson himself died not long after, but his past intelligence ties raised serious questions

275
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,500
about how the assassination was managed in the media.

276
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,280
These examples show how the Psychological Strategy Board's influence could extend

277
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,960
beyond psychological warfare into shaping public perception of major historical events.

278
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,620
And in Corso's case, how he went from the Army's CIC to a national security position

279
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,740
in government to knowledge of the UFO program.

280
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,720
The PSB had no shortage of interesting figures, but it just goes to show how connected psychological

281
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,300
warfare was to the hidden history of UFOs.

282
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:07,720
This is best shown in a series of declassified CIA documents from 1952.

283
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,020
One memo involving CIA Director Walter B. Smith highlights the national security risk

284
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,680
posed by flying saucers, not just as unknown aerial threats, but as tools that could be

285
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,740
exploited by the Soviets to spread hysteria or disrupt air defense systems.

286
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
The memo states,

287
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,420
These are psychological and air vulnerability.

288
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,900
Another document, this time from Smith to the director of the Psychological Strategy

289
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,620
Board, notes that over 1,500 UFO reports had been logged.

290
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,580
20% remained unexplained, prompting an urgent question.

291
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:58,000
Could these phenomena be controlled, predicted, or even used in military or psychological

292
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,480
operations?

293
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,160
At this point, Henry Kissinger re-enters the picture.

294
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,200
Around this time, he was recruited to produce reports for the Army in Korea and Germany.

295
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,040
He also became a direct consultant to the head of the Psychological Strategy Board himself,

296
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,440
Gordon Gray.

297
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,900
Gray was not a minor figure, a former secretary of the Army.

298
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:25,240
He had oversight of psychological warfare strategies across multiple agencies, and he

299
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,140
later chaired the committee that revoked Oppenheimer's security clearance.

300
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,240
He also served as National Security Advisor under Eisenhower.

301
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,380
His influence continued for decades, spanning the Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford administrations

302
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,560
as a member of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.

303
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,080
Gray was as embedded in the security state as one could be, and perhaps unsurprisingly,

304
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,800
he had connections to the UFO question.

305
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,040
Ansel Talbert wrote an article for the New York Herald Tribune in November of 1955 while

306
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,240
Gray was president of the University of North Carolina.

307
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,720
The article's title?

308
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,980
Conquest of Gravity, Aim of Top Scientists in United States.

309
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,120
It details the efforts of numerous universities, companies, top physicists, and documents their

310
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:31,440
prospects for studying and controlling gravity, a discovery which is of quote-unquote, tremendous

311
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,960
import to the field of aircraft design.

312
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,440
It also states that a proposal to establish an Institute of Pure Physics at the University

313
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,360
of North Carolina to carry on theoretical research on gravity had been sanctioned by

314
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:50,640
the Board of Trustees, which had the final approval of Dr. Gordon Gray.

315
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,680
In 1956, this Institute of Field Physics at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill

316
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:01,320
holds what's known as the Chapel Hill Conference, convening all of the world's top theoretical

317
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,200
physicists to discuss gravity.

318
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,120
This conference is sponsored by Wright Airfield.

319
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,920
The head of the Institute of Field Physics, Agnew Bonson, is also funding mid-century

320
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,880
inventor Thomas Townsend Brown, who is claiming to get successful positive results on gravity

321
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,960
manipulation experiments.

322
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,520
Gray was also named as one of the advisors on the top secret research and development

323
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,400
organization established by Truman as it appears in the leaked Majestic 12 documentation.

324
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,440
His deep ties to the military, psychological warfare, government, and academia on top of

325
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,800
this link to gravity research.

326
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,000
This makes a very plausible case that he would have been read into high level UFO programs.

327
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,040
So remember, these are the circles that Kissinger was moving in while he was still a graduate

328
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
student.

329
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,000
He wasn't just another Harvard intellectual.

330
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,080
He was corresponding with CIA Director Alan Dulles, consulting with Gordon Gray at the

331
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,240
Psychological Strategy Board and networking with the power brokers shaping Cold War intelligence.

332
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,680
All of this on top of his CIC work in Germany, managing the transition of Nazi scientists

333
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,880
and possibly their exotic propulsion research.

334
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,980
And once Kissinger got his PhD, these ties were developed further in tandem with his

335
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,560
academic development.

336
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,040
In 1955, Kissinger started to write critically of Eisenhower's nuclear strategy of massive

337
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,180
retaliation.

338
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,980
It was the threat of responding to an attack, conventional or nuclear, with an immediate

339
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,240
all out nuclear barrage.

340
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,200
Kissinger claimed this was outdated now that the Soviets maintained their own substantial

341
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,380
nuclear arsenal.

342
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,400
He argued that the United States should be ready to fight limited localized nuclear wars.

343
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,440
His writing was noticed, and he was invited by McGeorge Bundy, a colleague and professor

344
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,720
at Harvard at this time, to work with the Council on Foreign Relations.

345
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,600
The CFR, a private organization tied to elite circles of business, government, and academia,

346
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,080
was a crucible for Cold War policy.

347
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,160
Much like a think tank, it served as a discussion club of the most powerful and successful leaders

348
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,040
and well-connected figures of foreign affairs.

349
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,200
Walter Isaacson's biography of Kissinger describes the most exalted enterprises of the

350
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,640
CFR to be the so-called study groups, where around a dozen or so distinguished individuals

351
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,320
and wise men met regularly over the course of 12 months to explore a particular subject

352
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,700
in depth.

353
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,780
Each group had a study director, usually an up-and-coming academic, who would collate

354
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,260
their discussions into something that may or may not be disseminated to government or

355
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,260
the public.

356
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:41,220
For example, McGeorge Bundy was a part of a study group in the late 1940s that examined

357
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,180
Marshall Plan aid to Europe.

358
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,180
Some of its members should sound familiar.

359
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:50,540
Eisenhower, before his presidency, was involved, along with future CIA director Alan Dulles

360
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,100
and future CIA deputy director Richard M. Bissell.

361
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,360
Also contributing was George F. Kennan, just after writing his famous long telegram under

362
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,620
the pen name X, which shaped Cold War policy of containing Soviet communism.

363
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,020
So the who's who of international diplomacy.

364
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,860
Flick open your modern history of the United States, and these guys are all over it.

365
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,660
And as far as the hidden UFO history goes, aside from the obvious links to someone like

366
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:22,300
Eisenhower and the possible Majestic 12 advisory board, you've also got Richard Bissell,

367
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:27,020
who spearheaded developments in American reconnaissance aircraft like the U-2 and its

368
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,740
successor, the SR-71.

369
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:35,140
He knew his way around Area 51, and he was famously named by presidential adviser Harold

370
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:43,900
Malmgren as being the person who had briefed Malmgren on other world technologies.

371
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,060
In 1955, Kissinger was invited to direct a Council on Foreign Relations study group on

372
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,320
nuclear war and foreign policy.

373
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,120
He was briefed by Robert Oppenheimer himself and instructed to turn the findings into a

374
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
book.

375
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,840
The group was chaired by Gordon Dean, former head of the Atomic Energy Commission and included

376
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,080
top military officials, government insiders and scientists.

377
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,120
The resulting book, Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy, was a breakthrough.

378
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,520
Oppenheimer called it extraordinarily well informed, and it launched Kissinger into the

379
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,520
public eye.

380
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,400
By the end of the decade, he was advising the Joint Chiefs of Staff in making regular

381
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,140
TV appearances as a nuclear strategy expert.

382
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:28,060
Before the book was even published, Kissinger had been pulled into even more elite circles.

383
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:33,080
He was approached by one of the most powerful names in America, Nelson Rockefeller.

384
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,680
At the time, Rockefeller was serving as an adviser to President Eisenhower tasked with

385
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,240
countering Soviet influence in psychological warfare and beyond.

386
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,960
After Stalin's death in 1953, U.S. officials worried about a Soviet peace offensive aimed

387
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,960
at undermining U.S. military power, sowing discord among allies and backing revolutionary

388
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,480
movements in the developing world.

389
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,800
Rockefeller's job was to counter this, and he formed his own expert panel to strategize

390
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,280
for the president.

391
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,040
Kissinger was brought in alongside military leaders, academics and private sector figures.

392
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,880
The group first met at Quantico, Virginia to draft reports for Eisenhower.

393
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,160
This was Kissinger's first collaboration with Rockefeller, but far from his last.

394
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,420
Two years later, he would serve as the director for the Rockefeller Brothers Fund Special

395
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,880
Studies Project, a panel on U.S. international security objectives and strategy that included

396
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,440
Edward Teller.

397
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,840
Kissinger and Teller would work closely together on a number of occasions afterwards.

398
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,960
Teller was key to the Manhattan Project.

399
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,820
He was the inventor of the hydrogen bomb and was named in a document written by Australian

400
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,920
nuclear physicist Harry Turner.

401
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,520
This report, on behalf of Australian intelligence, aimed to investigate what the U.S. had been

402
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,920
studying when it came to UFOs.

403
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,080
Nobody in conventional national security circles disputes this report.

404
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,180
It's deemed valid as a very real document, and Harry Turner definitely led all nuclear

405
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:02,040
efforts for the Australian Joint Intelligence Organization, which is basically Australia's

406
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
CIA.

407
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,780
Turner stated that Edward Teller was working with others on the objective to control gravity.

408
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:13,280
So we have yet another close associate of Kissinger being implicated in the hidden history

409
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,680
of science and perhaps tech behind UFOs.

410
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,840
By the late 1950s, Kissinger was a tenured Harvard professor, a trusted advisor to the

411
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,320
military and government, and a rising public intellectual.

412
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,560
But his official assent leaves room for this hidden history to press against it.

413
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,320
Just recall Maria Wing's claim that her husband had worked directly under Kissinger, who was

414
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,400
in some capacity involved in the UFO program by this time.

415
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,800
This is tangential, but there is at least one document I was able to find that connects

416
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,000
Kissinger to the world of crash retrievals.

417
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,880
Hey guys, I wanted to tell you about my new favorite piece of apparel.

418
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,480
These are called the Perfect Jeans.

419
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,160
They're literally the perfect jeans.

420
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,640
I used to wear jeans all the time, and they're kind of rough and not super stretchy or breathable.

421
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,600
These are extremely comfortable.

422
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,560
They work in casual environments.

423
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,360
They work in work settings.

424
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,960
They come in six different sizes from 26 inches to 50 inches, and they're all around just

425
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,080
amazing.

Get the perfect jean.

437
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,040
A redacted history of Sandia Laboratories in New Mexico notes that Don Cotter, who was

438
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:00,080
later a Nixon administration advisor on atomic energy and assistant to the Secretary of Defense,

439
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,360
while Cotter had been promoted in 1961 to oversee advanced research at Kirtland Air

440
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Force Base.

441
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:12,320
As part of his work, Cotter organized interdisciplinary seminars featuring noted international experts

442
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,440
and specialists, one of them Henry Kissinger.

443
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:23,000
We also know that in 1962, as part of the Bluegill Triple Prime test in the Pacific,

444
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,280
one detonation reportedly downed a UFO.

445
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:31,640
Kraft was then recovered and sent to the Albuquerque Operations Office, which oversaw Los Alamos

446
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,320
and Sandia Labs at Kirtland Air Force Base.

447
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,880
Who was in charge of that office?

448
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,720
Lawrence Preston Geiss, better known as Jeff Bezos's maternal grandfather, who also worked

449
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,640
for the Atomic Energy Commission.

450
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,680
Harold Malmgren was presidential advisor for JFK at the time, and he was in charge of White

451
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,040
House efforts around this Bluegill Triple Prime test.

452
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,960
And in the Navy deck logs of the ships associated with the Bluegill Triple Prime test, you can

453
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,840
see that anomalous debris came out of the plume of this blast and was recovered.

454
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,280
The anomalous debris was then sent to New Mexico to be taken charge of by Lawrence

455
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,920
Preston Geiss.

456
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,040
So given that Harold Malmgren was in charge of the nuclear test for the White House, he

457
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,600
decided to scope things out with Lawrence Preston Geiss.

458
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,840
According to Malmgren, Geiss was directly involved in reverse engineering recovered

459
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,820
craft in this exact period.

460
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,000
So Malmgren went to go meet Geiss in New Mexico.

461
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,960
And according to Malmgren's tweets, Geiss was directly involved in reverse engineering

462
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,040
recovered craft in this exact period.

463
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,840
So another UFO crash retrieval is tied to Sandia Labs, where Dr. Wang worked and where

464
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,600
Kissinger is connected.

465
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,000
But the questions still exist.

466
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,560
Was Kissinger aware of any active UFO programs?

467
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,760
Was he actively managing them?

468
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,560
At this point, discussing whether Kissinger was involved in a UFO program inevitably leads

469
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:58,760
us to the leaked documents that have pointed to the existence of the Majestic 12.

470
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,280
Now I know some of you might already have strong opinions about the MJ-12 docs, but

471
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,440
I just want to remind viewers that it's not just one thing.

472
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,000
It's a collection of over 3000 pages from different eras leaked over decades.

473
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Yes, some of these could be forgeries.

474
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,580
Some of these could be purposeful misinformation, part of a limited hangout strategy.

475
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,040
But that doesn't make the whole thing invalid.

476
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,000
If we can sift through the evidence, you can find some really significant details and other

477
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,560
details that are corroborated by open source research.

478
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,040
Take for example a leaked MJ-12 document from 1995 recently discussed by Ross Coulthart

479
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,520
on News Nation with former Australian intelligence officer Jeff Cruickshank.

480
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:44,200
It details a top secret request from President John F. Kennedy to CIA Director Alan Dulles

481
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,880
on June 28, 1961.

482
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:53,840
In it, JFK asks for a review of MJ-12 intelligence operations as they relate to Cold War psychological

483
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
warfare.

484
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,760
Skeptics might dismiss this, but here's where it gets interesting.

485
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,800
A document was released in the 2022 JFK files, revealing Dulles had actually scheduled something

486
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,720
very interesting for that day, something completely unknown to the public in 1995.

487
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:16,400
The document showed two meetings between Dulles and JFK on June 28, 1961, a fact that would

488
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,200
have been impossible for a forger to predict decades earlier upon release of the MJ-12

489
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
documents.

490
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:30,280
There's a document in the MJ-12 files, these very disputed MJ-12 files, which has that

491
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,360
date of the 28th of June, 1961, correct?

492
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,360
Yep, that's correct.

493
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,120
And that's the date of a meeting between the CIA Director Alan Dulles and President John

494
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
F. Kennedy.

495
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
Twice.

496
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:52,840
No, nobody, nobody knew about that meeting until that diary was declassified in 2022.

497
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,640
That's correct.

498
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,480
This isn't the only MJ-12 document with verifiable details.

499
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,160
Others contain obscure, hard-to-fake markings and marginalia that experts have analyzed

500
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,440
as authentic.

501
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,000
This is similar to the Bob Lazar story, which I have reported on ad nauseum.

502
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,520
If it weren't for Bob Lazar, we might still not know that Area 51 exists, but there are

503
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,720
a lot of reasons to believe that aspects of the Bob Lazar story were pushed out as passage

504
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
material.

505
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,880
Let's get back to the MJ-12.

506
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,680
For the sake of those watching that might be new to this topic, let's quickly sketch

507
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,720
out a picture of what the MJ-12 is.

508
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:35,880
Allegedly, the Majestic 12 was a secret committee formed by President Truman in 1947 to handle

509
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,240
the extraterrestrial issue.

510
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,360
It included top scientists, military leaders, and government officials.

511
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,480
Figures like Vannevar Bush, Gordon Gray, Donald Menzel, and even Eisenhower.

512
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,680
All names we've already discussed.

513
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,640
But regardless of the reliability of any one document, consider the bigger picture.

514
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,880
MJ-12 was supposed to have been created at the same time the Truman administration was

515
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,680
facing an entirely new existential threat.

516
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,820
Nuclear weapons.

517
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,300
The atomic bomb changed the course of history.

518
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,340
It reshaped humanity's relationship with extinction itself.

519
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,180
There was a pre-nuclear world and a post-nuclear world.

520
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,180
So how did the government respond?

521
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:22,140
By forming classified interdisciplinary groups to study the issue, advise the military and

522
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:27,140
government, and develop strategies for managing the risks of this new era.

523
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,580
Okay, that seems pretty logical.

524
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:35,180
Now if anything truly extraordinary happened at, say, Roswell, what would you expect the

525
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,260
government to do?

526
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:42,300
Well you'd probably expect them to establish a classified interdisciplinary team to research

527
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:48,160
the phenomenon, its implications, learn what they could about any strategic advantages,

528
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,360
and decide what, if anything, the public should know about the topic.

529
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:57,440
Whether or not it was called MJ-12, the idea that a structured oversight body existed is

530
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,760
entirely consistent with how the US government responded to other world-changing events.

531
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,920
And other documents on top of Dulles' schedule, like the Eisenhower brief, have been fully

532
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,340
verified by open source research.

533
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,240
And that brings us back to Kissinger.

534
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,720
If such a program existed, and if it evolved over the decades from how it was supposedly

535
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:23,960
set up in the 1940s, how would somebody like Kissinger fit in?

536
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,240
Kissinger's early career placed him in positions that directly intersected with the roles described

537
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,200
in the MJ-12 documents.

538
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,880
His time within the Counterintelligence Corps during and after World War II positioned him

539
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,120
within an intelligence network that was deeply involved in early crash retrievals, and the

540
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:46,960
exploitation of Nazi scientific expertise through programs like Operation Paperclip.

541
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:53,100
Leaked MJ-12 memos from the 1940s reference CIC involvement in UFO investigations, including

542
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,540
Roswell.

543
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,900
When Kissinger returned to Harvard at the end of the war, it's plausible that he did

544
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,660
so with intelligence ties and some knowledge of secret technology programs.

545
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,560
If Kissinger's connection to MJ-12 deepened, it likely happened in the mid-1950s when his

546
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,860
role shifted from academia to directly shaping government policy.

547
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:18,540
His invitation to the Council on Foreign Relations study group on nuclear strategy placed him

548
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:23,620
alongside figures like Robert Oppenheimer and Gordon Dean, key players in both nuclear

549
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,620
policy and potentially the UFO issue.

550
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:31,760
For Kissinger to be included in these discussions, he would have needed a high security clearance.

551
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,700
Could the UFO question have been part of their classified deliberations?

552
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:40,500
While there's no direct proof, the overlap of names between the CFR study groups and

553
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,420
MJ-12 suggest they operated in adjacent circles.

554
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:49,020
Kissinger's role in Nelson Rockefeller's special studies project further cemented his

555
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,020
position.

556
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:54,120
Rockefeller and Eisenhower advisor led U.S. efforts to counter Soviet influence through

557
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,800
strategic initiatives.

558
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,560
This think tank included many figures from Kissinger's CFR group, creating potential

559
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,320
crossovers between official policy and classified programs.

560
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,120
We must assume that Rockefeller had some connection to MJ-12 by this point, too.

561
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,780
In fact, Detlev Brank, who was the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, was named as

562
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,480
one of the Majestic 12.

563
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,600
And this whole suggestion is not that the MJ-12 was a static organization.

564
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,300
It may have evolved in this period from a small Truman-era committee to a more structured

565
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:29,680
program under Eisenhower, and elite think tanks like these may have served as its intellectual

566
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,940
and strategic backbone.

567
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,340
This also raises the question, was this the moment private industry was let in on the

568
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,340
secret?

569
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,900
By the late 1950s, the U.S. government was increasingly outsourcing classified research

570
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,500
to private aerospace and defense contractors.

571
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,920
If MJ-12 or its successor wanted to study and reverse-engineer UFO materials while avoiding

572
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,480
congressional oversight, compartmentalizing the work within private corporations would

573
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,560
have been the ideal method.

574
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,520
This shift would implicate Kissinger throughout his close ties to Rockefeller, both in think

575
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,280
tanks and on his presidential campaigns.

576
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,240
Many of the special studies project's key recommendations were integrated into Eisenhower's

577
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,000
policies, appearing in his 1958 State of the Union address.

578
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Yet, much of its classified output remains locked in Rockefeller's archive center.

579
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,280
Depending on where you look, you'll find different claims about Kissinger's involvement.

580
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,000
Some argue that he was bought by the Rockefellers early on, particularly through a grant he

581
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,140
received while earning his PhD, and that his Harvard career was merely a cover for deeper

582
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:38,440
intelligence work advising MJ-12 through a specialized think tank known as PI-40.

583
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:44,160
Others suggest that MJ-12 and PI-40 were interchangeable names for the same group, which evolved over

584
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,200
decades, but remain embedded in the U.S. national security structure.

585
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,440
Even if we stay skeptical about the MJ-12 documents themselves, the broader logic of

586
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,520
their existence makes sense within Cold War power structures.

587
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:04,440
If a secret UFO study group existed, whether called MJ-12 or something else, Kissinger's

588
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,760
career trajectory places him squarely within the network of individuals likely to have

589
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,220
been involved.

590
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:15,660
Before making any definitive claims about Kissinger's role in MJ-12 or the UFO program,

591
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,180
one thing is certain.

592
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:22,500
Before he ever entered a presidential administration, he operated within a deeply secretive strata

593
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,620
of power.

594
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:28,560
His rise to one of the highest positions in the country may not be unconnected to the

595
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,260
relationships he had built since his time as a CIC agent.

596
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:37,040
In the 1960 election, John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Richard Nixon.

597
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,040
While Kissinger is now mainly associated with Nixon's legacy, it is often overlooked

598
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,320
that he also worked under Kennedy.

599
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,040
Kennedy's administration was filled with elite thinkers from different political and

600
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,580
industry backgrounds, including several who had worked on Rockefeller's special studies

601
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,520
project like Kissinger.

602
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,060
Despite working on Rockefeller's presidential run, writing speeches, and giving advice,

603
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,160
he had been approached by the Kennedy team in 1958 to discuss long-range problems and

604
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,800
weapons evaluation.

605
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,440
Officially, he was consulting the White House on nuclear weapons in Germany, but he remained

606
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,520
close to Rockefeller, seeing him as a future presidential contender.

607
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,260
The rest of his time was spent teaching at Harvard.

608
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,640
It was in this period that he cemented his staunch anti-communist stance.

609
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,880
As Neil Ferguson recounts, Kissinger saw nuclear weapons not as a curse, but as a potential

610
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,840
safeguard for civilization.

611
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,260
His view was that tactical nuclear weapons could and should be used to deter communism.

612
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,280
This willingness to prioritize strategic concerns over morality characterized his

613
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,760
entire approach to global problems.

614
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,340
If he applied the same logic to UFOs, he may have viewed them as another stabilizing element

615
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,900
that required secrecy and control.

616
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,180
It was also during this period in Kennedy's presidency that the Cold War had reached a

617
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,540
boiling point.

618
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:01,500
The Bay of Pigs disaster in 1961 led to the ousting of CIA Director Alan Dulles and Deputy

619
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,300
Director Richard Bissell.

620
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,300
Bissell notably didn't fade into obscurity.

621
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:11,780
This raises a question, how many others, sidelined from their official positions, continued to

622
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,220
operate within the hidden world of UFO programs?

623
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:19,940
In Bissell's case, the rumor was he left work at the CIA on Friday and on Monday he

624
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:25,020
returned because he was too indispensable to certain activities he was involved in.

625
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:30,780
It was just two months after the Bay of Pigs, in June of 1961, that Kennedy requested a

626
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:36,020
full briefing on MJ-12 activities from the head of the CIA, specifically with respect

627
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,140
to their role in Cold War psychological warfare.

628
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,500
This was before Dulles was dismissed, which occurred in November.

629
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:48,080
Did JFK's decision to clean house at the CIA overlap with an inquisition into the activities

630
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,660
of the MJ-12?

631
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:54,140
What did Kennedy find out, and what impact would this have had on his life?

632
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:59,460
The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.

633
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:07,620
When we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths,

634
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:14,020
and to secret proceedings, we decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted

635
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:21,780
concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.

636
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,180
Perhaps that will be a topic we can touch on another time, but it wasn't long before

637
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:30,100
another crisis emerged, the Berlin Standoff.

638
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:34,300
Kissinger found himself sidelined during this crisis, and despite nuclear being one of his

639
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,580
areas of expertise, he was scarcely consulted.

640
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,900
It wasn't long after that that Kissinger left the White House.

641
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,820
At the end of the 1960s, with Kennedy gone, the Johnson administration having run its

642
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:49,060
course, Rockefeller had again run for president.

643
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:53,640
But once again, the campaign didn't take, and Kissinger was unexpectedly available

644
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,760
when Nixon came calling.

645
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,920
Despite once calling Nixon the most dangerous candidate, Kissinger accepted the role of

646
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,600
National Security Advisor, marking the start of his most infamous chapter.

647
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,840
Why was Kissinger Nixon's choice?

648
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,520
Officially, his deep expertise in nuclear strategy and foreign policy made him invaluable.

649
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,580
It is often suggested that it was through his associations with MJ-12 or an MJ-12-like

650
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:23,160
group that Kissinger was considered the perfect person to accompany Nixon into the White House.

651
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,380
This Kissinger brought into the administration because he was the ideal person to oversee

652
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,740
another arms race, one hidden from public view.

653
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:36,460
Just as the Cold War saw a nuclear arms race alongside proxy wars, it is plausible that

654
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:42,580
there was also a secret technological arms race focused on reverse-engineering UFO technology.

655
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:46,980
If Kissinger's approach to nuclear weapons is any indication, he would have treated the

656
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:52,420
UFO issue extremely pragmatically, seeing it as a destabilizing factor that had to be

657
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,900
carefully managed.

658
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:58,300
His belief in secrecy, careful analysis, and psychological warfare would have made him

659
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,220
the perfect candidate to control access to such information.

660
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,300
It is unlikely that Kissinger saw UFOs as a fantastical anomaly.

661
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,380
For a man so entrenched in realpolitik, they would have been just another variable, albeit

662
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:16,160
an extraordinary one in the geopolitical equation, particularly if he had been aware of their

663
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,620
early existence since his early twenties.

664
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:22,820
So what influences might this have had on him since he reached the peak of U.S. power

665
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,520
in 1969?

666
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,060
The Nixon White House was home to scandals, secrets, and occasional absurdity.

667
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:33,380
One of the strangest stories tied to Nixon, and one that raises questions about what Kissinger

668
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,620
might have been aware of, involves the actor Jackie Gleason, who is famously obsessed

669
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,860
with UFOs.

670
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,260
He even built his house to resemble a flying saucer.

671
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:48,980
According to Gleason's ex-wife, one night in the 1970s, Nixon, possibly drunk, showed

672
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:54,220
up at the actor's house unannounced and took him to see alien bodies at a secret facility.

673
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:59,860
Gleason, reportedly shaken, shared the story upon returning home, only for it to resurface

674
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,060
in the tabloids years later.

675
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,080
Its ferocity is debatable.

676
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,840
Was Nixon bragging to impress his golf buddy, letting off steam?

677
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,900
Was it all fake?

678
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,100
No one knows.

679
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:15,180
But if Nixon was at all interested in UFOs, his closest advisor, who frequently endured

680
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,580
his late-night drunken tirades, was surely hearing about it.

681
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:25,940
Kissinger's time in the White House as National Security Advisor from 1969 to 1975, and Secretary

682
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:32,440
of State from 1973 to 1977, gave him immense power over U.S. foreign policy.

683
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,200
He shaped Cold War diplomacy, managed Vietnam, and opened relations with China.

684
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,840
But what about the hidden UFO history?

685
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,360
In these years, we have the official record, and then we have what was never meant to be

686
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,360
recorded.

687
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,920
The Watergate scandal, secret bombings in Southeast Asia, covert operations in Latin

688
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,620
America, and whatever was being discussed inside the 303 Committee, the secretive body

689
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:58,080
overseeing CIA missions.

690
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,760
But the question will remain if someone like Kissinger was involved in the MJ-12.

691
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,480
Did this overlap with his duties in the White House, in international relations, or with

692
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,240
this 303 Committee?

693
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:16,880
The 303 Committee was a secret U.S. interagency group that oversaw all covert operations,

694
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,060
and Kissinger was involved with it.

695
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:23,120
So how much crossover was there between the official and hidden history when it came to

696
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:29,400
the 303 Committee, or the 5412 Unit which had preceded it, or the 40 Group which came

697
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:35,080
after it, the names given to the small, high-level teams that oversaw all covert operations

698
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,780
for the U.S. government?

699
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:40,780
Were they as deeply involved in UFOs as some researchers suggest?

700
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:45,600
Officially, these groups' members typically included the National Security Advisor, senior

701
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,620
officials from the CIA, and representatives from the state and defense departments.

702
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:55,420
Their job was to approve covert actions while shielding the president from direct involvement.

703
00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:00,940
Nominally, this separation was ensured to maintain plausible deniability on the part

704
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,580
of the president.

705
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:08,140
But this nominal separation at times allowed this group to wield power over the president,

706
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,820
and to do things without the president's permission.

707
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:15,900
It's easy to think that UFO secrecy would be bound up in these continuity of government

708
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:20,780
programs, which is perhaps why these official names are sometimes said to be interchangeable

709
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,660
with MJ-12 in the UFO space.

710
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:28,980
Alternatively, could programs like MJ-12 have evolved into operations more akin to the CIA's

711
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:35,340
or MK-ULTRA, discrete groups acting with autonomy shielded from higher levels of government

712
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,340
oversight?

713
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:40,900
If these secrets ever make it to the archives, we might get a definitive answer.

714
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,980
Until then, solid links between Kissinger and UFO programs are rare.

715
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,780
But there are a few other breadcrumbs that stand out.

716
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:52,700
Firstly, we have circumstantial evidence of Harold Malmgren brought into the Nixon administration

717
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,700
in 1971.

718
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:59,780
Influentialist Matthew Pines has suggested that Malmgren was, at times, just as influential

719
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:04,300
as Kissinger, almost acting as a check on Kissinger's own power.

720
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,900
Harold was, you know, self-consciously not a self-promoter.

721
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,700
He was not someone who was looking for the power.

722
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,360
He was recognized and his survivability was because he was going to be the guy working

723
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,900
behind the scenes, executing, not taking credit, just the guy who would get stuff done, right?

724
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,320
And that was, you know, whereas Kissinger was the guy who would, like, you know, walk

725
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,320
over people's necks, right?

726
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,240
But they were in equal positions, right?

727
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,120
They were trusted and they were often used by presidents, you know, to check each other.

728
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:36,480
Malmgren was used explicitly by Nixon to check Kissinger in many negotiations, to, like,

729
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,920
confirm that Kissinger wasn't going rogue on various things.

730
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,560
And the whole China thing, the back channels with the Soviets, Malmgren was Nixon's, like,

731
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,520
you know, confirmation route, right?

732
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,360
Because he didn't fully trust Kissinger to do all this stuff, because Kissinger was kind

733
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,360
of his rogue guy, right?

734
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,760
He thought he was the president, right?

735
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,120
So Malmgren was there to kind of, like, act as a bit of a check.

736
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:01,120
It would certainly make sense then that if Malmgren had been read into otherworldly technology

737
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,540
by Richard Bissell around this time, that if he had seen evidence of the craft down

738
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:10,480
during the Bluegill Triple Prime explosion that was taken to Los Alamos, then Kissinger,

739
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,200
with his deep connections to nuclear strategy and intelligence, likely had a similar level

740
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,200
of awareness.

741
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,180
Then there is the most intriguing clue of all.

742
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:25,780
On January of 1977, just before leaving office, Kissinger sent a telegram to the U.S. Embassy

743
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:33,060
in Ottawa requesting a report on, quote-unquote, possible returned space objects.

744
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,920
The subject line, Moondust.

745
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,660
Operation Moondust was a Cold War-era program established by the U.S. Air Force to recover

746
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:46,740
and analyze foreign space debris, including Soviet satellites and other advanced technology.

747
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:52,120
However, declassified documents reveal that Moondust's remit extended beyond conventional

748
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,840
technology to include unidentified objects.

749
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,920
This leads some to speculate that it may have dealt with extraterrestrial materials.

750
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:06,040
Other declassified documents which describe similar circumstances or directly reference

751
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,660
Moondust add to this mystery.

752
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:13,660
One document describes the recovery of spherical objects in New Zealand farmland.

753
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:18,220
Another details a fireball and subsequent sightings of silent aircraft near a Bolivian

754
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,220
crash site.

755
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:24,060
Incredibly, I found one that was sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which discusses

756
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:31,100
a 1957 UFO event in Afghanistan that rivals what reportedly occurred at Roswell.

757
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:36,500
These documents suggest a striking similarity between Moondust's operations and the procedures

758
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:42,440
outlined in MJ-12 documents and what we now know about legacy UFO programs.

759
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,040
Does Kissinger's telegram prove he was involved?

760
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,360
Not exactly, but it confirms he was aware of Moondust, and given everything else that

761
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:55,840
he had done until this point, well perhaps this breadcrumb, however meager, is a significant

762
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,840
one.

763
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:02,440
Kissinger's role under Nixon is often cited as emblematic of centralized secret governance.

764
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,220
Journalist William Shawcross described how Kissinger controlled the National Security

765
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:11,700
Council's processes, funneling decisions through layers of analysis he personally managed.

766
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:16,680
This allowed him to decide what Nixon would review while bypassing bureaucratic dissent.

767
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,800
In 1968, before even entering the White House, Kissinger wrote,

768
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:26,220
The only way secrecy can be kept is to exclude from the making of the decisions all those

769
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:29,480
who are theoretically charged with carrying it out.

770
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:35,520
This philosophy, deliberately keeping key decisions out of reach, even from senior military

771
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,560
and government figures, mirrors the kind of compartmentalization that seems to have governed

772
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,260
UFO secrecy.

773
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:47,220
This seems like a direct result of his work for the CIC, and for the Psychological Strategy

774
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,600
Board, and who knows, perhaps for the MJ-12.

775
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:55,720
As Marvin and Bernard Kalb suggested in their biography of Kissinger, apparently he had

776
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,580
no trouble justifying these kinds of deceptive practices.

777
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,280
Kissinger's approach to governance was simple.

778
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,540
Achieve the objective, whatever it takes.

779
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:09,620
Secrecy, deception, even actions that, in hindsight, many consider criminal.

780
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:14,020
The same logic could have been applied to managing disruptive technology of non-human

781
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,020
origin.

782
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:20,420
If UFOs posed a Cold War threat or advantage, they could have been compartmentalized, controlled,

783
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:25,380
and kept out of public reach, and Kissinger would have been in a prime position to oversee

784
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,940
such efforts.

785
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,460
And his legacy is still visible today.

786
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:34,140
For all the cynicism and warranted criticism surrounding Kissinger's tenure, his real

787
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:39,420
political approach to diplomacy achieved notable successes, such as opening relations

788
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,720
with China and advancing arms control through the SALT-1 talks.

789
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,880
It would be incredibly interesting from a historical perspective to find out if there

790
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:53,560
was some kind of UFO-related impetus or rationale behind some of these moves, and in particular

791
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:59,100
if Kissinger was using his knowledge or position within that hidden network to parlay or barter

792
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,420
these relations.

793
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:04,740
Due to Kissinger's possible awareness of the UFO issue, he probably would have used

794
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,460
this secret knowledge to his advantage when he felt it necessary.

795
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:13,300
And despite the decades of tension and mistrust that came after, Kissinger remains a popular

796
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:16,180
figure in both Beijing and Moscow.

797
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:19,080
He was a longtime confidant of Vladimir Putin.

798
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:23,380
There is a telling exchange between the two from the 90s, when in conversation with the

799
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:28,420
future Russian president about their respective backgrounds, Putin told Kissinger he got his

800
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:32,060
start in intelligence, to which Kissinger replied,

801
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:40,340
In China as well, Kissinger has remained relevant since the 70s.

802
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:46,020
President Xi Jinping described him as an old friend, stating that Sino-US relations will

803
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,120
always be linked with the name of Henry Kissinger.

804
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:55,260
Both Putin and Xi expressed sincere condolences when Kissinger died at age 100 in November

805
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,040
of 2023.

806
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,960
Sources like Richard Bissell, who moved from the CIA into private defense, suggest that

807
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:07,440
real secrecy does not end when someone's ties to an administration does.

808
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,600
So did Kissinger continue operating in classified spheres even after leaving government?

809
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:17,680
His access to power remained unbroken for decades, and he was continually sought out

810
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:23,800
for foreign policy counsel on China, post-911, Iraq, and even AI.

811
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:28,240
Was he playing a longer game, leveraging hidden knowledge in ways we still don't

812
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,240
understand?

813
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:34,000
Modern UFO whistleblower David Grush has suggested that someone like former Vice President

814
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,040
Dick Cheney was a gatekeeper of the UFO program.

815
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:43,840
If such a role exists, it must have been occupied before Cheney, possibly by another Machiavellian

816
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,880
operative, by Kissinger himself.

817
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,720
Some figures exist in the public eye, but operate a second life in the shadows, redacted,

818
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,280
classified, denied.

819
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:59,260
It takes a certain kind of person to thrive in that space, someone ruthless, someone pragmatic.

820
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:04,500
Someone who can manage nuclear strategy, covert wars, and morally indefensible decisions.

821
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,580
Maybe even UFO programs.

822
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:11,360
So whether Kissinger was exactly what Maria Wing described to Bill Steinman on the phone,

823
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,280
I think it's very possible.

824
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,840
And it makes you think, does that position still exist?

825
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,720
Who is the gatekeeper now?

826
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,400
And will we ever know?

827
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,240
Until next episode, my name's Jesse Michaels, and this is American Alchemy.
