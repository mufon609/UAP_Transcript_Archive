0:01
[Music] so why are we here I think uh this talk
0:09
we want to kind of accomplish two aims one is talking about how UFOs are real they're they're real phenomena they're
0:15
real thing but I think that's somewhat pay and conventional at this point over 50% of the American population at this
0:22
point probably believes in the existence of UFOs we're at hereticon so I think the real heresy here would be actually
0:30
linking uh UFOs as a modern observable scientific phenomena with uh past
0:36
religious phenomena so Angels and Demons would be kind of the popular nomenclature of of of the past is what
0:41
we're experiencing today what we've experienced in the past and so is religion actually real you know the uh
0:48
Latin root of religion is religare which means to relink and it's our belief on this panel that uh through observing
0:56
UFOs we can relink ourselves with uh you know kind of a past epistemology that
1:01
we've always had and that modernity is actually somewhat of an aberration from that epistemology so I have two amazing
1:09
guests to discuss this uh with me first I have Diana Walsh Pula she is a
1:15
classicist and um religious studies Professor who specializes in Catholic history she wrote a great book in 2014
1:22
called Heaven Can Wait about the Catholic concept of purgatory and then uh very interestingly she followed that
1:28
up with two books on uh UFO phenomena as kind of a meta religious modern
1:34
phenomena uh 2018 she wrote an amazing book called American Cosmic which is like the modern ufology Bible I I highly
1:41
recommend you read it and in 2023 she wrote a great book called encounters and she in her own right is somewhat of a
1:46
you know kind of a Mystic and Truth seeker and so very honored to have her uh we also have Colonel Carl Nell uh on
1:54
stage um very excited to have him he's a he's a very polymathic thinker and uh
1:59
it's always hard to present him because his CV is is very long and impressive but he uh worked at aerospace companies
2:05
like locked Martin northr Grumman he's commanded every level of the army uh to Brigade um he helped set up Army Futures
2:13
command so he he ran a lot of tech modernization efforts for the Army and probably most relevant for this talk he
2:19
was the Army representative for the UAP or unidentified anomalous phenomena task
2:25
force which basically was directed to look into uh UAP UFOs I'll use those
2:31
interchangeably in their existence and reality and so you know he's a privil
2:37
for priv do a lot of classified information but here he'll be talking about the non-classified information and I want to start with you Carl uh to you
2:46
know Alay audience you know uh how would you convince them that UFOs are real
2:51
because this whole talk is kind of you know predicated on that fact well thank you Jesse it's a pleasure to be here and great to be here with Diana and really
The Case For Aliens (First Principles Thinking)
2:58
excited about this event so yeah we actually uh looked into this area and so
3:04
probably privy to a lot of information that's not publicly available so you know how can the rest of the folks out
3:11
there maybe have some confidence that uh you know there's some reality to this subject so there's sort of three lines
3:17
of evidence that you can look at uh there's the first principles there's sort of testimonial from people that are
3:22
in positions to know and then there's the data so like if we're going to kind of run through those from first
3:28
principles uh you know the the going in position is probably the laws of physics are the same uh here that they are
3:34
everywhere else and and undoubt there's some exceptions but in general that's pretty much accepted by everybody and so
3:40
if you look at how quickly life evolved on our planet uh the uh argument that's
3:46
usually made is that life is uncommon and that faster than light travel is not possible and both of these things really
3:53
have no evidence for them it's the exact opposite so for instance uh their blue green algae fossilized in stromatolites
4:00
from 3.5 billion years ago and recent scholarship has indicated that life may
4:05
have evolved even earlier 4.1 billion years ago so the Earth itself is five
4:11
billion years old the crust has not even cooled by uh 4.1 billion years ago so
4:16
there's evidence that life evolved on Earth at the earliest possible time even earlier than would be reasonably um
4:23
suspected there's microbes that can live in outer space that we've determined are viable and recently as of maybe a month
4:31
ago people identified microbes that were in stasis in two billion year old terrestrial rock that were brought back
4:38
to life so it's in essence life is either evolving very quickly or some sort of pans spermia situation going on
4:44
that's what all the evidence sort of suggests if you look at the sun the sun's what's called a population one
4:50
star there's 20 billion uh population one stars in the galaxy the sun is like
4:56
a relatively young population one star there's Stars that are like the sun that are five billion years older than the
5:03
Sun so that's like a massive amount of time for other civilizations to potentially evolve on these other
5:08
planets and and just statistically so then you look at like faster than light travel like can they get here you you
5:14
don't even need that assumption but Miguel alcir a Mexican postgraduate
5:19
student University of Mexico in 1994 solved Einstein's equations for an effective faster than light mechanism
5:26
NASA's looked into this there's there's no dispute that the solution is a valid solution so it requires this thing
5:32
called negative energy to work well negative energy is a component of quantum mechanics the cosmere effect
5:38
which was known in the 60s and demonstrated in the 90s is evidence for the for the existence of negative energy
5:45
the expansion of the universe which we've recently determined is accelerating is due to something called Dark Energy dark energy is negative
5:53
energy so we've got an effective solution for Einstein's equations that requires negative energy and we know
5:58
negative energy exists this isn't an engineering solution but it is a theoretical solution so it was
6:05
it's very much disingenuous to suggest that life is uh uncommon and fast and light travel as possible both of those
6:11
are false so that's sort of the first principles argument once you kind of put that into the context of all the other
6:17
evidence so let's look at testimonial now testimonial isn't uh hard scientific
Testimonial Evidence
6:23
factual data but then you've got to explain why people such as uh Barack Obama Donald Trump all say that UFOs are
6:30
real they're in a position to have been briefed on this you can look at uh the
6:36
uh admiral of the fleet Lord Hill Norton of the United Kingdom former M um Minister of Defense staff has basically
6:42
said UFOs are real you can look at uh Heim Eed the father of the Israeli space
6:48
program that says non-human intelligence is real you can look at Paul helier the
6:53
uh former minister of defense for Canada has said non-human intelligence is real
6:59
you can look at uh Chris melon who's the first assistant secretary of defense for intelligence for the progenitor for the
7:05
under secretary for Intel and security has come out and said UFOs are real you can look at David grush who just
7:12
testified last year before the house committee on oversight to the effect that there is a government program
7:18
looking at UFOs because they're real and he was accompanied by two Naval aviators
7:23
that said the same thing you can look at Lou Alando who's a very famous uh UAP
7:30
whistleblower so and and there's many more of these so that's sort of like the testimonial evidence in fact you can
7:36
look at uh the legislation that was just submitted by Senator Schumer and Senator
7:42
rounds and as well as Senator Rubio and Senator gilbran and several other of their colleagues last year that
7:49
basically said we need to look into this uh the Congress is not being told the truth and uh there's evidence that the
7:56
government knows more than what they're saying about this topic fact Senator RS and Senator Schumer had a cqu to discuss
8:03
this very topic and intended to reintroduce that legislation and so then you can look at the data we've got
8:08
videos what they call colloquially the Flur the gimal the go fast video that
8:13
show unidentified uh flying objects that the Pentagon has asserted are not ours
8:19
and are not our adversaries and they date from events that happened in 2004 in 2015 you can look at uh the
8:27
experience of Gordon Cooper one of American America's first Mercury 7 astronauts who chased UFOs in 1951 over
8:35
West Germany and it testified before the uh the United Nations in 1979 to that
8:41
fact you can look at the uh incursions over the northern us ballistic missile
8:46
warning system in the 70s where uh Radars were picking up UFOs and then you can look at in the 1960s the Readiness
8:54
status change at of our icbms at malstrom Air Force Base where missiles
9:00
were taken offline and then in the Soviet Union an analogous thing where missiles were brought online and there
9:06
Foy a documents and testimony to the reality of that there's an agreement between the former Soviet Union and the
9:12
United States that's still in force intending to reduce the threat of nuclear war where there's a stipulation
9:18
that either side will notify the other if UFOs impact their um missile early Warning Systems so people say well if
9:26
this is real like why don't they just like you know um land on the White House lawn well in
9:31
1952 the radar visual sightings over Washington DC for two weekends including
9:37
air-to-air intercepts that precipitated the largest press conference since World War II up to that time and so people say
9:44
well okay why don't just l in the middle of the day and um that's happened in 1994 in Rua Zimbabwe where uh craft
9:52
landed and beings presented themselves to uh Elementary School age children uh
9:58
in the middle of the day that that an almost similar identical incident happened in
10:03
1966 in West Hall Australia there's a a concerted correlation between um UFO or
10:09
UAP activity and nuclear sites the pantac site in uh Texas and the Hanford
10:16
plutonium production Facility have numerous UFO um sightings and correlations and in fact there this
10:23
extends to overseas sites even the Fukushima incident had um had correlations so so looking at the
10:30
evidence both from the standpoint of first principles from the standpoint of people who would know and from factual
10:36
information it's indisputable that this is a real phenomenon and when it comes to UFOs I
Biblical UFOs
10:42
think there's this kind of misnomer that this all started in the 40s it started with the Advent of our nuclear program
10:49
Diana you've done some amazing work about how this might comport with things that we've observed in our religious
10:55
tradition and in history in the past okay yeah sure so um first I want to
11:01
explain a little bit about what we do in my field which is called religious studies uh religious studies is a
11:07
discipline that is academic so I'm not going to we don't advocate for religion we're not ministers or theologians we're
11:13
academics we use archaeology history um you know academic disciplines in order
11:19
to look at Social effects of of basically religion uh most of the people
11:24
in the world are religious more than 8 usually 83 about 83 to 85% of the world
11:31
um affiliate with some religion so it's actually important to study religion I'm not going to advocate for belief in UFOs
11:38
I'm going to tell you my story about how I got into this because I was never I never thought about UFOs in fact until
11:44
three years ago I had not seen Close Encounters of the Third Kind and U what a great movie that is by the way so um
11:51
so yeah so I'm not going to advocate for belief in UFOs but what I am going to do is tell you about my entrance into this
11:58
field which has ramped up considerably since I started in 2012 so in 2012 I was
12:05
writing a book called Heaven Can Wait about what in my field we call Ascent narratives all cultures have their own
12:12
forms of this uh genre of of uh oral tradition or literature and what an
12:18
Ascent narrative is is basically a person who is either touring uh the
12:24
afterlife like Dante touring hell patory and then Heaven A pre-christian Ascent
12:29
narrative would be the allegory of the cave uh in Plato's Republic where uh a
12:35
person thinks that reality are these Shadows on the wall and ascends out of the cave and recognizes that wow there's
12:41
another reality so this is what I was doing I was looking at Ascent narratives in the Catholic history in Christian
12:47
history and I utilized um archives so archives are I've been to the Vatican
12:53
and looked at their various archives they have many uh over 53 miles of shelving of old documents um these are
13:00
the kinds of things you see in archives material culture codexes you know things like this Philadelphia has a wonderful
13:07
archive um so I looked at archives and I was looking for data about uh Purgatory
13:13
which I found but I also found reports of aerial phenomena by Catholic people
13:20
from Europe and Canada and United States from 1200 to 1800 and I thought the were
13:27
these were interesting because a lot of time s when Catholic European Catholics say saw something in the sky um they
13:34
would have a moment of confusion what is this um you know what are the things they would see in the sky so they would
13:39
see discs uh light orbs uh sometimes they would see things they thought were
13:45
flying houses okay the Flying House of Laredo um so these you know they would see these aerial phenomena and I took
13:52
notes because I'm a researcher and that's what I do I don't leave data out so I had this long list of these uh
13:59
writings sometimes they would interpret them as Souls from purgatory that needed to be prayed away um but they they saw
14:06
these things and I thought that was interesting but UFOs never crossed my mind so I kept a long a log of these
14:13
sightings so I showed a friend of mine and said what do you think of these reports and immediately he looked at
14:18
them and said they remind me of a a stevenh Spielberg movie they look like UFOs and I thought he was silly okay I
14:24
thought he was silly um I didn't think about it again until I started to publish my information about these
14:31
events and reports what now I call Angel contact events generally is what I uh
14:36
how I refer to them um I started to get inquiries from people at aerospace
14:43
companies and not just one I got a lot and I was thinking that this was strange
14:50
because this has never happened to me before when I was writing about Catholic history but it was this spe specific um
14:58
thing which was the Angel reports and they wanted my data and they were very interested in certain things they wanted
15:04
to know what did the people describe seeing um did the people describe uh
15:10
light what was the color of the light uh what did the objects look like and most
15:15
interesting to me did the people report injuries okay did the people report
15:21
injuries well yes actually they did but um so they wanted my data um I happened to meet one of these people uh this was
15:28
quite an impressive person is I call him pseudonymously in the book that I wrote about this um Tyler and he had amazing
15:35
credentials um he worked for our space program uh he was the government lison
15:41
to Elon Musk for certain missions and he said that they had acquired debris from
15:49
UFO crash sites and that he was reverse engineering these and they were creating
15:56
this technology kind of gamechanging technology that was in 2016 that I went
16:01
with um with people that I had to have as pseudonyms okay so now Gary Nolan has
16:07
come out and that's actually a relief to me that he's come out as himself and the reason why we went was because Tyler
16:14
who's still a pseudonym um for a person who is a mission controller and works in the space force so whereas I was looking
16:21
at these as maybe metaphoric or historical you know not necessarily well not at all real that's not what we do in
16:28
my field we're not looking at these as real things all of these very intelligent um credentialed highly
16:34
placed people scientists were looking at these as if they were real and so that
16:39
was shocking to me okay um I then looked back at my Tradition at the Catholic
16:45
tradition and I looked at some of the most iconic um Angel contact events and
16:51
I began to understand them in a different way and one that you might know about is the um the stigmata so the
16:59
Stigmata happened to St Francis of AI arguably the most famous saint of the
St. Francis & Angels
17:05
Catholic Church you even though you may not be Catholic you've seen statues of him if you've you know gone into Gardens
17:11
you'll see him he has you know usually a bird on his shoulder or something like that so A very charismatic person living
17:17
in the 1200s in Europe and um he had an experience of thankfully they have one
17:24
of these here of this seraphim so if you'll see over here in the icon of this event is a seraphim which I thought was really
17:31
it actually convinced me to come I was like yeah I'll come and I'll talk about what I've studied and you know what I
17:36
know about um so the seraphim um is uh is this Angel and it doesn't look like
17:43
the angels that we typically know about and um well if you look at the primary source material of these contact events
17:50
it looks like that and it generally has an eye in the middle of it and it does it injure I looked at the primary source
17:57
material for St Frank Francis of aisi and what I found was that when he had
18:03
this contact with this thing that he described as a seraphim it came down there was light it had an eye and there
18:11
are competing primary source reports but the best report shows that brother Leo
18:17
who's about 15 he's watching and he sees that this is how he describes it that
18:23
this thing dealt harshly with Francis afterwards Francis was injured and the
18:29
tradition determines that these injuries are called the wounds of Christ what happened was that this was a a very hush
18:37
hush situation for Francis and Leo and when they went back to the convent um
18:42
they he he tried uh as best as he could to make Francis comfortable because he was injured and they didn't tell anybody
18:50
okay so it was completely quiet um it was a stigma okay it was literally a
18:56
stigma and so um he heent po died most likely from these wounds and what's so
19:03
amazing about that story the burns on on uh St Francis of ais's hands really
19:09
comport Ono one with what the CIA is now studying as far as people who've encountered UFOs so they work with um
19:17
Gary Nolan who's a microbiologist Nobel nominee at Stanford who has actually has a foundation dedicated to this and the
19:23
CIA came knocking at his door and they're like we have this files of people who've had all these anomalous experiences
19:29
and they really comport with you know it's like he had you know electromagnetic radiation they just
19:34
didn't really have the words to describe it but in using the term Stigmata and stigma uh we bring up this idea of
Non-Disclosure From the Government
19:41
non-disclosure this idea that power structures kind of institutionally gate reality from us so is that happening in
19:48
the modern UFO context as well Carl yeah thanks for that question so yeah exactly so there's sort of six principles or
19:55
reasons for non-disclosure of this information from a government stand point the first being National Security
20:00
like you don't want the adversary to know what you know and and uh and so on and then you know the second reason is
20:06
sort of lack of a plan this is so profound and impactful uh and as Peter T
20:11
sort of alluded you know there may be technology with unknown ramification and uh you know if you let
20:17
that out there could have significantly detrimental effect so you've got this lack of a plan issue you've got this
20:22
potential for societal disruption like the ontological shock that will come from a realization of you know angels
20:28
and Aliens you've got the potential for a covert agreement where people are benefiting from the status quo uh that
20:34
is non-public the potential for misdeeds having occurred and the desire to cover up misdeeds and the potential just
20:41
organizational transigence lack of a priority that you would expect of any type of U bureaucracy and so this isn't
20:48
like necessarily theoretical right you can look at historical documents 1953 there's Declassified documents there's a
20:55
a panel called the Robertson panel at the CIA that basically said the government decides to debunk this topic
21:02
to uh misdirect the public and to actually infiltrate uh the organizations that existed at the time the public
21:09
organizations that were looking into this this is absolutely established fact nobody disputes this and the documents
21:15
are available in uh people perhaps heard of Project Blue Book this uh in dozen
21:20
year study looking at UFOs by the US Air Force Air Force wanted to get out of this job they commissioned a study from
21:27
the University of Colorado Ed Condon led the studies Manhattan Project Alum he wrote the conclusion of
21:34
the study before the study was complete bragged about it a lot of the scientists on the study defected publicly from the
21:41
study the study got published the content of the study is uh at odds with
21:46
the conclusions but the Air Force canceled project bluewick anyway so this really leads to uh what I think are sort
21:53
of four heresies that maybe we'd like to talk about in the context of the hereticon the first being that
21:59
non-disclosure of um uncomfortable aspects of reality is a universal constant across cultures and across time
22:07
and the second piece as Diana alluded is that there's a hierarchy of being with non-human Intelligence being included in
22:13
that cosmism which Diane is an expert at is at the root of both the Russian and
22:19
the US space program and Consciousness is a component not only of metaphysics
22:24
but of physics itself I actually want to get get into cosmism so this idea that I mean you uh
Cosmism
22:33
met a uh you know somebody deep in the space program who was a nuts and bolts you know contributor to our space
22:39
program we think of our space program as you know Elon Musk is the tip of the spear all we have is sort of chemical
22:45
combustion um but you're speaking to this guy who in your book you write about pseudonymously named Tyler who uh
22:52
is engaging in sort of like Consciousness protocols and that's somehow a essential to his work and then
23:00
you go back and you do research about the early American and Russian space programs and how you know a lot of these
23:05
people think that they're in touch with Angelic and in certain cases demonic beings do you want to talk about that
23:12
yeah sure so um so cosmism what's that so there are uh when this when this
23:18
happened to me in 2012 um I started to get my bearings after you know this recognition that people in Aerospace in
23:26
some of these companies were actually doing this work and what this meant um I
23:31
was shocked I saw my own tradition from a different lens and I decided to go
23:36
back and to look at the space programs the viable ones that would be the American Space Program ours and the
23:42
Russian space program and so I started to do the preliminary you know work that a person does when they're looking at
23:49
this is you know what were their belief systems um the ones that inspired these
23:54
men in the early 20th century late uh 19th century early 20th century what
24:00
inspired them to create rocket technologies that were successful and actually got us off the planet so if you
24:06
go to the Russian Cosmos tradition which is a similar tradition you know where they believe in you know like uh
24:12
Constantine chikovsky believed in nhi and that he was you know he believed in this and he wrote books about it and
24:17
he's the father of Russian rocketry they're Christian they have kind of a Christian overlay to this or framework
24:24
and so I saw this as the beginning of the Russian Space Program and I began to do the same work with our
24:31
space program and in fact I found it was Jack Parson's now of course if anybody knows about Jack Parson the patterns
24:38
here match in terms of he believed that he was in contact Jack Parsons is the father of our uh Space Program by the
24:44
way um super interesting guy um work with Alistar Crowley so obviously he's
24:50
not giving his nhi a Christian veneer but I wouldn't say he's calling it
24:55
demonic though like sorry that's my interpretation yeah a lot of people say oh he was you know demonic but he didn't
25:01
view what he was doing as demonic he actually viewed what he was doing as good he thought that he was working for
25:07
the common task of humans of getting us into the space so this would be the uh
25:13
the Russian and the American uh COs in fact I named my book American Cosmic
25:19
because I was impressed that we hadn't talked about it and I thought that somebody should modernity is an
25:25
aberration and that we think man is Apex Consciousness that that is sort of a detour when it comes to the epistemology
25:31
of mankind over you know across thousands of years and in fact uh Many religious scholars in the past have gone
25:37
so far as to classify a lot of the beings you know between us and God and so St Thomas aquinus had his Angel
25:45
hierarchies uh amus who's a Syrian neoplatonist also had similar Angel hierarchies and they literally have
Angel Hierarchies (Modern Frameworks)
25:51
taxonomies and categorizations for these angels they describe them they describe some of the effects of people that
25:56
observe them some in some cases it's literally will say like irradiated light so it sounds like kind of electromagnetic you know damage or
26:03
whatever so Carl do we have any kind of modern scientific Frameworks for how we should think about nhi or kind of you
26:11
know them being higher on the kind of Consciousness or evolution chain yeah so
26:16
the uh the scale that's often used is What's called the kardashev scale Nicolai kardashev Uh Russian astronomer
26:22
back in 1964 sort of proposed during the age where Optical astronomy was becoming
26:28
popular and radioastronomy is coming on to identify civilizations based on the
26:34
ability of uh them to access the energy of entire star so you could build this thing called a Dyson Sphere around a sun
26:40
and so that would blot out the visible light but there'd be a big IR signature and if you know um astronomers could
26:47
detect this then they detect the civilization so he called that a type two civilization and then by extension
26:53
there's a type three civilization that controls you know all the energy output of a galaxy let's say and type one
26:58
civilization maybe a little bit more advanced from our own that's basically controlling the whole planet so this is
27:04
the kardashev scale You Know Carl Sean talks about this Neil degrass Tyson Mitch ukaku it's it's like a popular
27:11
thing I would argue though that the scales it's it's really not very instructive to look at like UFOs and UAP
27:17
because total civilization energy usage is like an unknowable thing based on um
27:22
observations of potential craft or potential recovered material or biologics or what have you so there's a
27:29
better model out there uh that I would recommend which is the universal civilization development model and it
27:34
goes off of like what they have what they know and who they are and so what they have would be more about energy
27:40
density than the magnitude of energy usage so energy density like if I've got a certain energy density I get fire I
27:46
got greater energy density over a longer time I can smelt metal ultimately I can do nuclear reactions maybe I can warp
27:53
space and time maybe I can even impact the laws of physics so that's the physics of energy jacqu valet has talked
27:59
about this idea of physics of information so how much about the nature of reality does this civilization
28:05
perhaps know how much complexity can their ma can they manage what's the time constant for their thought process how
28:11
many parallel paths can they contemplate as a single time this idea of Consciousness comes into play so this
28:18
you know almost a physics of information now is this other dimension and then the third dimension is U the ecological
28:24
evolutionary Dimension what is the chemical basis for for for this life form where are they on the evolutionary
28:31
path maybe not just a hundred years ahead of us maybe a million years what's what's it look like for a life form to
28:36
be a billion years ahead of us what's their relationship with their environment are is it omnivorous they
28:42
derive from omnivorous stock herbivore stock uh Etc so all these things create
28:47
a phase space perhaps that would be populated by a range of beings and the and the distance in this phase space you
28:53
know we might call it the Hamming Distance by analogy with electromagnetic signal prod in might dictate the
29:00
likelihood of a competition symbiotic or competitive relationship based on uh the
29:05
likely hierarchies that undoubtedly exist Diana we're talking about
29:11
hierarchy of being and man not being the Apex of Consciousness and then we're also talking about uh us you know
29:17
scientists and engineers at the top of our space program using Consciousness protocols um if any of this stuff is
29:24
true I mean I I feel like a lot of people in the audience probably did come and walk into this room believing these
29:30
things are we in Plato's Cave are we in this sort of epistemic cave and if we
Allegory of the Cave / The Apocalypse
29:35
are how do we get out yes that's a great question so um okay first off I don't I
29:42
don't think and I'm gonna reference Peter's talk okay because I thought it was really a great segue into some of
29:48
the things that we were going to talk about you know we're we're told that um there's nothing worse than Armageddon
29:54
but perhaps there is perhaps we should fear the Antichrist perhaps we should should fear the One World totalitarian
30:00
state uh more than Armageddon and so I would say that the apocalypse is
30:05
structural uh so for anyone in my field um we know that the apocalypse is always
30:10
happening okay there's always an apocalypse so the early Christians who were Jewish actually did have their
30:16
apocalypse uh you know the the Romans destroyed their temple in 70 that was an
30:21
apocalypse that those very specifically Jewish Christians were were knowing was
30:27
going to happen it happened but we go on things go on okay so what is it then so
30:33
the idea that um that there is an out or that you know there's there's a solution
30:39
to the apocalypse Plato suggests that uh it's it's in the allegory of the cave so
30:45
he never answers the question but he gives this allegory and what it is is basically a conversation he calls it the
30:51
dialectic and he says that um what you can do is you can have this conversation
30:57
so there's a sense of Community baked in here but it's a it's more than just a conversation it's a conversation about
31:04
Justice it's a conversation about goodness so you're saying kind of
31:09
contemplation of virtue literally allows you to ascend out of this world in some way in some sort of metaphysical way I'm
31:15
not sure I do believe that's what he's saying and he's he's basically saying that there is a sort of conversation
31:22
that you can have probably not a text message right and um and that it is a
31:29
it's that's what he presents as the out and I think if there's a third option it's going to be that so with Plato
31:35
Diana is sort of talking about maybe a Proto architecture to religion and Carl we've had kind of offline conversations
31:43
where you've said to me that maybe the esoteric version of a lot of the world's religions are actually sort of
31:49
normalizable they actually contain a lot of similarities when it comes to kind of encounters with non-human intelligence
31:55
do you want to talk about that yeah well I think that actually right so most of these sort of the gnosic tradition the
Mysticism / Egypt
32:02
uh Sufi tradition in Islam uh the kabala in uh Judaism and even nulas vedant all
32:09
talk about this sort of inward looking initiatic experience where you're you know you're transcending this reality
32:16
and connecting with a deeper reality so there there's actually an interesting um study that was done the oldest uh large
32:23
Corpus like significant Corpus of religious texts like in the world anywhere of any tradition any culture
32:30
are the pyramid texts like fifth Dynasty uh Egypt something like you know 2500 BC
32:38
and so the uh egyptological interpretation of the pyramid text is
32:44
funerary but there's a counter counterveiling scholarship that says well actually it's like really
32:49
initiatory when egyptology was created it moved away from mysticism and went
32:55
totally rationalist and so the ancient Greeks and the ancient Romans anybody that actually knew Egyptian civilization
33:01
firsthand knew that they were very esoteric and so egyp scholarship has
33:07
moved away from that and made the Egyptians extremely rationalist and very much funeral ritual based once you put
33:15
the initiatic experience into the pyramid texts based on something called the said Festival which is essentially a
33:20
kingship ritual that's known to exist then the pyramid and the pyramid text
33:25
become an initiatic engine that um that the living might actually Embark upon
33:31
and this is interesting because then it creates direct connective tissue between the Hermetic tradition and the Gnostic
33:38
tradition that came out of late period Egypt and then influenced um both
33:43
classical Antiquity and then early Christian um theology so you've got essentially a a linear line that can now
33:50
be traced potentially to the earliest tradition in an esoteric sense it's a great Meister reart quote U theologians
33:57
May Coral but Mystics all speak the same language so I think it speaks to that sort of proarch and there's actually a
34:02
story I think of Jewish kabalists meeting with the doy Lama and they're like talking about these non-human
34:08
intelligences and the colors associated with them and they're just kind of laughing about how kind of in agreement
34:13
they are worldview wise I want to stick with you Carl because we are in a room full of entrepreneurs and people in
34:19
venture capital and so they might be thinking okay this all this stuff might be real but I don't really see it and
34:24
it's kind of ephemeral and like what does this have to do with me is that is any of this investable uh can we turn
34:30
this into a company right Carl do you want to well right well I might hit that ball right back at you because uh
34:36
Jesse's done a number of podcasts looking into tailor towns in brown and some other very interesting uh like
Technology
34:43
heretical Technologies so I'd invite people uh unsolicited plug to check out
34:48
some of Jesse's podcasts U but I would also submit to you if you sort of look at the Arc of technological development
34:55
we're getting to the point that Fineman had talked about in the early 60s about there's room at the bottom which is by
35:02
which he meant like we're getting at the level where we can engineer at the molecular level at the nature that that
35:08
that nature operates and so these disciplines that uh originally appeared to be disperate like information science
35:15
Material Science the semiconductor Fab genomics Etc all look pretty much the
35:22
same uh once you're able to engineer at the molecular level so information and materials start to merge you can come up
35:28
with programmable matter perhaps self-healing structures self-repairing structures you're you're starting to
35:34
move into that vanoyan machine uh level so I would suggest you know looking at that area then we alluded earlier to
35:41
this thing called the kmir effect the kmir effect you put two parallel plates that are conducting very close together
35:48
and you would expect classically nothing would happen but what it actually ends up happening this was predicted and
35:53
measured is that there's negative energy states that are uh created in between the plates in other words there's
36:00
certain Quantum fluctuations that are not supportable between those plates and there's a pressure that's created
36:07
between uh from the pressure outside the plates versus inside and the plates
36:12
compress so basically that's extracting energy out of the vacuum like that's like free energy like that's not
36:19
disputable that's like proven fact so unfortunately it's not rep uh reciprocal
36:24
nobody's figured out how to make a reciprocating machine you got to reset the plates to get the energy out so that
36:31
is something that's potentially scalable to a battery perhaps uh but it be a one-hot battery if somebody can figure
36:37
out a way to make that scalable that would be extremely uh beneficial so so those are a couple uh Avenues but just
36:44
to sort of recap like the heresies right so non-disclosure is a universal constant uh of society this idea of
36:51
hierarchy of being cosmism you know this esoteric aspect of um reality being at
36:57
the basis of the space program and Consciousness playing a role in both physics and metaphysics where our
37:04
technolog is getting to the point where we can perhaps develop a physical basis for Consciousness and then develop
37:10
Technologies out of Consciousness which oh by the way any more advanced
37:15
civilizations probably already gotten to should open uh I think our eyes collectively that there's sort of group
37:21
think going on and opportunities that are right in front of our face are being missed uh because uh we're not
37:28
incorporating these other aspects of reality so in that sense agnosticism is not like an optional worldview well Carl
37:35
I'll take that plug to the bank I really appreciate it um I want to wrap up with you Diana Peter teal was on uh uh Joe
37:43
Rogan a month ago and he was asked about aliens like half the conversation was about aliens and he cited your work
37:48
which was fascinating uh and he said that uh aliens uh are not only probably
37:54
Angels and Demons they have to be Angels and Demons because of the Dual use nature of tech and the forcing function
Angels & Demons
38:01
nature of tech and so the pulka literal thing I'd come to is the aliens it's not
38:08
that they might be demons or Angels they must be demons or Angels if you have faster than light travel and both of
38:16
those seem pretty crazy to me and so if you have warp drive technology as a deliver as a delivery mechanism for a
38:22
payload like a nuclear weapon that's you can't defend against that and I find it interesting you talk about St Francis of
38:29
aisi seeing what was probably a craft or an orb a seraphim and um the last thing
38:36
he writes in his diary is the Greek letter Tao which uh means conversion
38:42
yeah and so it was like this forcing function conversion and so in the world in which you know uh a aliens which are
38:49
being you know at least in the form of UFOs seen at record levels now statistically or you know as far as data
38:55
the data goes um is the veil falling you know the the the the word Apocalypse in
39:00
its original Greek means the unveiling are we seeing these things at a greater preponderance because we are living in
39:06
the apocalypse and what does that mean as far as how we should live our own lives yeah I do think we're living in a
39:11
apocalypse I think that there is an unveiling going on and I think this is a great amazing time so yes I think
39:18
so all right thank you guys yeah thank you
39:25
Jess I'm here with Diana Walsh Pula uh we just had an amazing talk with Colonel
39:30
Carl Nell and it's funny in our first conversation you brought up this concept of emergence yeah and this idea that you
39:37
would get uh kind of interdisciplinary intersections between experts in various
39:42
fields which the UFO phenomena kind of brings together because you can go at it with so many angles and I thought it was
39:49
a really great conversation between a guy who in a kind of a nuts and bolts
Hereticon Talk
39:54
you know very hard-headed fashion look through a bunch of class ified material came out of that experience on the UAP
40:00
task force saying I think UFOs are real and trying to drive a lot of this forward through legislature and and
40:06
other means and then a religious studies Professor who had no interest in UFOs
40:11
and was just objectively kind of looking at religious as a phenomena and not even
40:16
looking at it as some you know underlying metaphysical truth bumping into the UFO uh phenomena so what did
40:23
you think about that talk I'm really impressed with his knowledge so so not only is he excellent at nuts and bolts
40:30
and looking at you know the technical aspects of UAP UFOs but he knows the
40:35
whole history of religions back to egyptology and he's able to in a sense
40:40
do what I do and what jacqu valet did right which was look at the historical
40:45
record and find evidence of nhi um UAP you know whatever you want to
40:53
say about it um angels as they have been termed so yeah I had a really great time
40:59
talking with him and I think that that um you also added a lot to it because
41:05
you know both sides well do what I can I I I appreciate both of you uh gracing us
41:11
with your presence and before our conversation uh Peter teal who's kind of you know helping Host this event did a
41:18
really interesting talk on the Antichrist so he's been focusing on the Antichrist and he's been talking about
41:24
it as um you know in history you know how has the Antichrist been represented
41:31
when we think about the Antichrist um how best to conceal being
The Antichrist
41:37
the Antichrist well that is to talk about it a lot and basically to you know push this this idea that uh there's an
41:45
apocalypse okay and that we are you know we need to save save ourselves and do
41:50
good okay and of course everybody's going to agree with that and that's a great veneer and then he reminds he
41:57
reminded the audience that that's of course how the Antichrist presents as the one that is you know giving the
42:04
solution and so I thought that was really interesting what do you think about that I thought so too he cites
42:09
Thessalonians peace and safety being the slogan of the Antichrist I think you look at a lot of evil that's done in
42:16
today's world without getting too specific depending on which side of the aisle you're on but it's on it's on both
42:21
sides and um I think you have a lot of today's evil is couched in this veneer
42:28
of kind of utilitarian effective altruism world is my sandbox I'm going
42:34
to you know uh rearrange the figures you know on on a global scale and like make
42:39
things sort of work out and that is sort of a form of evil it's also outward looking so it's never inward looking
42:46
like am I doing bad or am I harming people you know and you met Renee Gerard yeah yeah I love his theories I'm a
42:53
girardian too and Gerard always says you know to even spot a scapegoat you need a
42:59
third-party witness because nobody thinks that they're doing the scapegoating and in fact we're doing
43:04
scapegoating all day long and the the history of humanity is the history of human violence and that all of us have
43:11
sort of you know greedy greedy impulses and there's obviously violence up until you know Murder and large scale war and
43:18
stuff but we do small violence to one another all the time through mimetic desires and jealousy and that sort of
43:24
thing and we have to look inward yeah that's right so um his Professor was
Rene Girard
43:30
Renee Gerard and I was at Berkeley at the time at the Jesuit School of Theology and and Peter was at Stanford
43:36
and so while he was taking these classes I was actually driving to Rene Gerard's
43:42
colloquiums to listen to him and I so I had been exposed to his theories When I
43:47
Was An undergraduate at the University of California in Davis and his book violence in the sacred kind of broke
43:54
through and really destabilized a lot of different disciplines and a lot of people didn't like it because it was
44:01
such a giant Theory of Everything right it was really a theory of everything like a theory of evil right and and he
44:07
Rene Gerard is a was a Catholic right and he did attend I believe it was Latin
44:13
mass and so the Jesuits that I was taking courses from they didn't want to
44:19
go themselves because there was something kind of heretical about Rene Gerard because there was no they they
44:25
said there wasn't anything really transcendent about Christ for Rene Gerard that he looked at evil as anthrop
44:32
like an anthropology like you know that we were you know we there was no Transcendent or metaphysical evil that
44:39
he spoke of I think what's so heretical about Gerard is and why he was s sort of not accepted both by religious Scholars
44:45
or by you know evolutionary biologists in his time is because he has this sort of theory of everything you know this
44:51
kind of Proto architecture like to religion and so that's like real heresy yes it absolutely is yeah and we talked
44:57
about that earlier in the context of Plato maybe another person who has this kind of Proto architecture of religion
45:03
so we were talking you know off camera before this you were saying you know you
45:08
interpret Plato maybe slightly differently than a lot of kind of uh quote unquote uh philosophers or
45:14
Scholars that's right yeah yeah so of course I I read Plato you know early on as an undergraduate and again as a
45:20
graduate student but I really didn't start actually reading Plato until I
45:27
encountered the people who believed in UFOs and I saw the um the ways in which
Plato
45:33
UFOs have been you know concealed by our government within this environment where
45:38
I witnessed harassment firsthand saw people who were um the quote unquote
45:43
whistleblowers being harassed and you know it's not pretty it's terrible and I was depressed so I thought you know how
45:51
do I make sense of this and so Plato's Republic kept coming back into my head
45:57
and Plato by the way he asked the question can there be a just society and why he asks this is because he's pretty
46:03
horrified by what happened to his mentor his mentor was killed by his government which was Athens and his and Socrates
46:10
was given it out but he didn't take it instead he said I live by the laws of Athens and I'll die by them and this is
46:16
just this is right well Plato didn't buy that it seems he has a dialogue between Socrates and glan and they asked the
46:23
question can we have a just government and they go through all these ridiculous scenarios he's saying that no it doesn't
46:30
look like we can figure out how to have a just government how do we do it well then he performs it he does a
46:36
performative thing at the end of the Republic and so what does he give us he gives us two things that we call
46:42
allegories or metaphors one is the allegory of the cave people are you know see Shadows on the wall and they think
46:50
that this and people are are showing them these Shadows by the way so we tend not to know we tend to discount that
46:57
there are other people that are like or things that are showing us these shadows
47:02
and we are thinking that they're reality and somehow we get out and we Ascend out of the cave and we recognize that wow
47:08
most people are completely blinded by this okay so how how does this work them and so then he like throws in basically
47:16
the first recorded or one of the first recorded ndes which is the myth of er
47:21
which is about the soldier who dies in battle and has a near-death experience and sees that people actually uh you
47:28
know live again they're Immortal they have some kind of soul and so he tells this story well those are two very
47:34
strange ways to end this book about the just society and so when I'd asked my professors you know what does this mean
47:40
because I went back to them and I even asked my friends who are philosophers so what do you think about this uh ah it's
47:45
just a metaphor it's just an allegory well I don't think it is so there so
47:50
what's then the takeaway the takeaway is a performative thing it's nothing that you can say Jesse do this and it'll be
47:58
all right no you have to actually do it what is it well it's basically creating
48:03
a community of people like the other person um so you know it's called the
48:08
dialectic and it's a form it's a mystical conversation basically which is
48:14
really hard for us to wrap our brains around what does it even mean to have a mystical conversation I think that if
48:21
people are watching this talk they've had a mystical conversation right and you have to like think of those times
48:28
when you met that person who's like your best friend and every time you saw them
48:34
the energy would change you know and you'd have such an amazing talk that's what he's talking about that kind of
48:40
community community based on that because wouldn't you die for that person you know wouldn't you do those things
48:46
that are noble before that friendship yeah okay so that's the kind of thing
48:52
that he's giving us that's amazing well yeah and I think a lot of Plato readers
48:58
think of him as fully allegorical and they don't think there's some metaphysical architecture that he's actually talking about like the myth of
49:04
ER I think is a great example so the cave is another example but u in the case of the myth of er he's talking
49:11
about this uh myth where you have anamnesis you have this idea that
49:17
there's this primordial Soul self that kind of has knowledge of all of your incarnations and then you cross the
49:24
river of forgetfulness into you know an Incarnation where you forget your former
49:29
self and um maybe through kind of a near-death experience or a mystery ritual which by the way Plato we
49:36
probably now know went through the linian mystery rituals himself that's right and so he probably believed this
49:42
like to all the people that think it's just an allegory you know then you experience noesis you you you regain
49:48
knowledge of your kind of IM Immortal Soul do you think that literal reading of of Plato is an important kind of
49:54
overlay that is missing in today's reading I think that a lot so you know I
50:01
went through graduate school and of course any kind of literalist reading of any of these texts is abhor so people
50:08
are going to say no you can't read it literally like that and I know okay okay so yeah did he really mean it this way
50:16
well not necessarily literally there's a cave you know but he meant it in a very real sense and that's what I'm trying to
50:23
to get at here and um and yes there's you know this goes against the grain of
50:29
of both liberal and conservative readings of Plato right it's a completely mystical reading here it goes
50:37
beyond even you know some people read it as this is the subjectivity of you know human subjectivity it goes beyond that
50:44
because it poses something other than the human itself or himself or herself
50:50
um so so yeah so another thing too is that the early Christians actually utili
50:56
this text so in uh you know we found now in the 1940s we found a lot of libraries
51:04
of the early Christians and we got an insight into what you know influenced
51:10
them well the allegory of the cave and Plato's Republic influenced them you know so they found something very
51:15
Transcendent Transcendent and very jesus-like right in these texts so it's
51:22
a lineage you see I didn't know that yeah wow what are there examples of kind
Esotericism
51:28
of connections between early Christianity and I guess Martin Luther King I think wrote uh an essay about the
51:34
Pagan continuity hypothesis yeah and so I you know there's this idea even the Last Supper might have been kind of a
51:41
mystery ritual of sorts Elaine Pagel also writes about that that's right so we're learning so a lot of people think
51:47
that Christianity is set and it doesn't change right well Archaeology is showing us and material culture is showing us so
51:54
many things that we are learning about the early Christians and also I would suggest that the Greek Orthodox Church
52:01
really does actually know about this connection between Socrates and the Greeks you know the Greek Socratic
52:08
philosophers basically and this lineage that goes directly into Christianity early Christianity it's a hellenized
52:15
Judaism right so it's a Judaism that's completely infused with Greek thought
52:20
like you look at the Apostle Paul um all of the Greek um all of the scriptures of
52:25
Christianity are Greek Greek are written in Greek okay so so yes this this makes
52:30
sense wasn't Paul supposedly According to some Scholars kind of a cabalist too
52:35
like he was a in the meraba kind of um you know Ezekiel tradition it looks like
52:41
it I mean you know I'm not a new testament scholar so I don't want to go out on Limb and say for sure you know that was but yeah if you look at his you
52:48
know his conversion it looks similar to meraba you know uh and I do have friends
52:54
who are New Testament Scholars and they won't they don't feel comfortable coming out and saying these things but they'll
53:00
tell me in secret they'll say yeah yeah you know Jesus too by the way I'm like really why don't you write a book about
53:06
that the book of he goes up on the cloud that's right that's right it's it's amazing how much some of these kind of
53:13
esoteric religious practices actually comport like if you look at the uh heot
53:19
the Palaces of you know Jewish cabalism or whatever you have seven of these palaces well in Egypt you had the arit
53:25
you know the the seven and then you know in Rosicrucianism you know he goes up through seven levels and you know he he
53:32
has to leave a garment behind on each level at each level you always encounter kind of uh you know these different
53:38
beings um you know some are good some are bad but they sort of you know are all testing you that's right so it's
53:44
very fascinating so we're talking about this tradition this merkaba tradition that seemingly talks about a a form of
53:53
community if not a government a form of community a Ecclesia right that's the the early church Greek term for the
54:01
community right that's based on these connections with merkaba seraphim what
54:10
have you these kinds of uh knowledge bearers messengers of God right and so
54:16
how does that how would that look today that's a great question I don't
54:21
know how how would it look today Diana well I think that I think that we're seeing it now I think we're seeing the
54:27
very beginnings of this type of recognition that they're you know UFOs yeah that's what I think is going on and
54:34
there's you know this recognition that we're not alone okay and I mean that was
54:39
the premise for a lot of those schools was that we're not alone but you have to get right with these things yeah okay so
54:46
that's what that's the whole idea was they were looking inward so they weren't looking outward so the whole tradition
54:52
like of Paul he changes his name because you know think about his conversion it was he was Saul and he was living a life
54:59
of violence of all things right he was very violent now why he was violent I don't know but he was persecuting and
55:05
wanting Christians to die and then he has this merkaba situation that he
55:11
seemingly didn't cultivate right it happened just spontaneously to him it
55:17
seems you know at least from his position he didn't call it into his life and then it changes him he changes his
55:23
name and then he works for these communities he gives his life to the formation of these communities so how
55:29
should one an average person sort of conceptualize this stuff because you know it seems like if you read like
55:35
William James there's kind of an outer ring of religious people that don't truly believe in the metaphysical kind
55:41
of architecture underneath the religion they just kind of show up to church or synagogue or a mosque and they kind of
55:47
pray and they do the daily rituals maybe it's this Pascal's wager for them where it's this like hyper rational if I do
Religion is Real
55:52
this thing maybe there's an afterlife and then you have these Mystics sort of go straight at the truth but that seems
55:59
kind of dangerous from like a you know institutional power structure perspective like often these Mystics are
56:06
misinterpreted or clamped down on by human power structures and then even in
56:12
a more primordial sense or whatever there's the parable of the four rabbis who all try to go up into the heavens
56:18
and like you know one goes mad two die and like I might be botching this but like one one makes it right and so it's
56:25
this like extremely straight and narrow treacherous path yes yeah yeah yeah it is right so like why should anybody take
56:31
that path no I totally agree I'm in agreement with that uh but when students do come through my classes you know I
56:37
teach basic you know survey of religions you know kind of thing and when we were in the Christianity section I'm in the
56:44
South so there are lots of Christians in my class you know they're they go to church and so I say why do you go to
56:50
church and they don't know right and I say do you you know what about this part
56:55
of the Bible where you know is talking about this angel or that angel and you know this and that and they're like well
57:00
that doesn't happen anymore right and so I think that they're you know so I try
57:07
to get them to to interrogate you know their own religion like what does it say
57:12
why are you Christian you know or why are you Jewish like why are you doing this you know is it just because this is
57:17
your the cultural tradition your heritage because it could be and that's fair enough okay yeah um but what I
57:24
really liked about Carl Nell's talk at the salt uh conference was that he
57:30
basically did the same thing and I thought it was really interesting but he did the same thing of well you know
57:36
you're talking you're talking to relig people who are religious and all of a sudden they're confronted with the reality that what they think is this
57:42
metaphysical thing is actually real well that's going to be a shock for them are you implying that perhaps we as a
57:47
society may not be ready for disclosure I I guess I would draw an analogy though for people that believe
57:54
in a certain Faith tradition what ever that Faith tradition is and hold to that And subscribe to that in a very serious
58:01
and devout way and and you know sort of pose the question even for folks of that
58:07
ilk and I would count myself as one if you're confronted with the reality of
58:12
your religious belief system like the reality of the metaphysical uh an angel
58:18
a a Reser from god what have you that's going to be a SE State change in your in
58:23
your way of dealing with reality right even even though you already believe it right so it's one thing to believe and
58:29
it's another to know and I think in this context this this phenomena has an
58:35
analogous the potential for an analogous effect both on the individual and on society and I was actually shocked that
58:41
he said it and I was like Wow uh that's kind of what I say to students but never
58:46
in this never so bluntly like never like no this is a re reality you know because
58:52
I can't really say that I you know maybe it's a reality maybe it's not a reality um but there's whole tradition of it
58:59
yeah well it's it's still like one of these things where believing this stuff you know it can either sort of burn you
59:06
or save you like it feels like even angels themselves are kind of misinterpreted as these like cherubic
59:11
friendly beings you know in in in the modern day and in fact if you look historically at Angel interactions that
59:18
you know a lot of which he write about uh these can be extremely violent and they can you know deal with you very
59:24
harshly and they can set you on a path that might be sort of more morally pure they might excavate sort of bad things
59:30
that leave you and you know you become better or whatever but it can be extremely painful in the process yes I
59:37
think so so one of the things that was shocking to me when I first started doing this was the reality that the
59:42
government was looking into it as real whereas I was looking into it as
59:47
truly historical metaphorical not real okay then I recognized that a lot of
59:53
people felt like it was their duty to contact these things right and that again that brought me to another level
1:00:00
of like what a bad idea you know because historically well here's an example so
1:00:05
when I first started corresponding with AER Aerospace people people in Aerospace
1:00:11
um corporations and things like that um they they wanted the data like they
1:00:16
wanted to know what did European Catholics see um when they saw an angel or a demon or something like that uh did
1:00:24
did they have any effect like what kind of effects did they have on their bodies and things like that and did they have
1:00:30
any did they report like other types of effects well yeah all that data is there so you know I started to look at it and
1:00:35
I met Gary Nolan so I met Gary Nolan pretty early on probably about 2014 and he shared with me his own
1:00:43
research so he had been recruited just as I was being recruited he was also recruited to work with people who were
1:00:49
you know in the program I guess you could call it or I don't know how to really discuss it you know he
1:00:56
the government was looking into uaps and he was a person who could help okay so
1:01:01
they recruited him and I got to see some of the research that he was doing and
1:01:07
some of it had to do with the effects that it had on people and they were like
1:01:13
radiation Burns and things like that so looking through the historical record I saw that indeed there were cases where
1:01:18
people reported being hurt you know in in this way um so yeah so it's not the
1:01:24
best idea then to just decide that this is something you're going to undertake and I never propose that by the way I
1:01:30
always say learn learn about it but don't engage in doing it like I propose
1:01:35
for people if they're interested if they actually have their own religious tradition check it out go back to it and
1:01:43
look at it again so if it's Judaism go back to it there's a rich Heritage Buddhism same thing go back to it
1:01:48
there's a rich Heritage my My Religion uh Catholicism go back to it there's a
1:01:54
rich Heritage there so I I think that's probably the best way to start looking
1:02:00
at it and it's so fascinating that contemporary
1:02:05
Aerospace uh you know people are reaching out to you as well as you know people from NASA uh it does feel like
1:02:12
we're on the precipice of kind of this new age where a lot of this stuff seems to be coming out because the
1:02:19
conventional history of a lot of these programs and companies are just you know chemical combustion nuts and bolts you
1:02:25
know it's all kind of this materialist reductionist science but in fact I think when you speak to a lot of people at
Occult NASA
1:02:31
these these organizations they're extremely open-minded and it's almost like science cleaved off in like the 50s
1:02:39
or 60s and hit a culdesac and kind of Academia and then Aerospace just kept
1:02:45
going but it's this also you have this religious veilance on top of it as well
1:02:50
where like the early NASA missions had you know uh Horus and Osiris and um it
1:02:55
was like I mean you told me in our last interview right it was like uh Greek and Latin you know on symbology and yeah
1:03:04
first century Latin first century Latin that's right the Empire The Empire wh
1:03:09
why do you think they kind of were paying homage to that tradition yeah
1:03:15
that's such a great question so first I don't know yeah okay nobody would ever give me a straight answer yeah but I did
1:03:22
ask do you think there's somebody in charge who was like yeah like I know that the like Greeks had it right and
1:03:28
you have to sort of deal with these nhi in order to get to space and like this is the program or do you think it was
1:03:34
some emergent thing that like they were kind of softly in touch maybe that's an unanswerable question I don't know but
1:03:40
um I believe that so my own opinion about this this is just my opinion after looking and talking to people that are
1:03:46
you know the people that are doing it actually you know doing okay so um they would tell me that this was a way to pay
1:03:55
a AG to the sponsors they call them the sponsors and I you know i' ask do they
1:04:02
read Latin you know kind of thing like really and they would say absolutely I think that it's a large tradition that
1:04:10
goes unacknowledged in our history and you think it's sort of hermetically
1:04:16
passed oh for sure absolutely it is yes but that's fascinating because that's sort of tying today's space program to
1:04:22
like maybe you know hermetically sealed you know uh Egyptian you know Traditions
1:04:28
like like how far back does this s amazing I know I mean it's it's definitely it's not a christianized
1:04:34
veneer so if you go to the Russian Cosmos tradition which is a similar tradition you know where they believe in
1:04:40
you know like uh Constantine chikovsky believed in nhi and that he was you know he believed in this and he wrote books
1:04:46
about it and he's the father of Russian rocketry um they're Christian they have
1:04:52
kind of a Christian overlay to this or framework but you know we have Jack Parsons
1:04:59
definitely not a Christian um but then you do have the same you know you have the impetus that stays there it's not as
1:05:06
weird as Jack Parson's but it's weird enough it's definitely not Christian it seems to be Greco Roman you know with
1:05:13
the the recognition that that that there are these deities right you know and uh
1:05:19
does it go back to Egypt I don't know I don't know you know I am not an Insider
1:05:24
so I don't have an inside track I just can spot the myth that's being called a
1:05:32
myth but it's actually real that they're like create you know they are they are doing this intentionally well I think
1:05:38
that's kind of this myth in disclosure overall because like both of us are on the outside but we've like poked you
1:05:45
know we've poked around like we have like a decent mental map that's probably like better than just the average person
1:05:50
who's like not really you know interested in this stuff right and like my my serious inclination now that was
1:05:58
not the case a few years ago is that there's like no one in charge or that like if it is there is something in
1:06:05
charge it's this like Loosely distributed weird thing that's like emerging and has like a a mind of its
1:06:11
own and maybe there are some people kind of tapped into deeper layers of reality
1:06:16
but it's certainly not commensurate with some clear clearance system or
1:06:21
classification system within the government yeah that's okay so I fully on board with that theory and you know
1:06:28
because you can't we can't prove it can we yeah but it's just a theory but I'll give you some examples but we've met
1:06:34
enough people who like people on the outside are like that's the Deep State architect of the Godfather of the UFO
1:06:41
stuff and like we meet them and they're like well they don't know a lot of stuff that this other person knows and you know there's like a lot of that going on
1:06:47
yeah a lot of it so that made me actually think about the oral tradition of it because I was around enough people
1:06:54
to know that they figured out their missions not from asking people or having someone
1:07:02
tell them they had to figure it out on their own and that process was hard for them and they didn't even know that they
1:07:08
got it right until they got an award for it like two years later yeah so they didn't know and they would also tell me
1:07:14
things like well people were on this Mission but they never knew until they got the the uh you know the uh the card
1:07:22
or not the card the patch yeah until they got the patch or or whatnot or they you know they figured it out and so I
1:07:28
was beginning to see it as when I I have friends that are uh indigenous and uh
1:07:35
they occasionally tell me a couple of things you know about their worldview and the way that they're uh like
1:07:42
Australian Aboriginal culture works right and apparently there's like a
1:07:48
very um succinct and transmissible oral
1:07:53
tradition that is really old like you know what 30,000 years old or something like that and it has to do with you know
1:08:00
nhi and things like that and so I begin to see our space program like that like
1:08:06
wow that's how it works there's an oral tradition that's transmitted but it's not transmitted through this memo you
1:08:13
know so the Declassified memos what do they really mean you know when there's this type of tradition yeah well all the
1:08:19
memos seem like they're kind of groping in the dark and they don't really know what these things are I'm a big fan of this mid-century inventor Townsen Brown
1:08:27
who we talked about earlier with Carl Nell and he says it's like you know fish in the water they don't know you know
1:08:32
the they just see the holes of the ships over over top but they have no idea what those ships are transporting or why
1:08:38
they're there and that really you know feels like where we're at but you bring
1:08:45
up the this idea of a patch what what do you mean by that okay so the patches so um in the space force or whatever we
1:08:52
call it today you know where people are on to send things up into space satellites or what have you uh they work
1:08:59
on these these um and they get these patches okay so a lot of people know about these patches they have a Roman
1:09:06
God on them or something like that and they usually have the the Latin that describes the the mission but in a way
Tyler
1:09:14
that's really opaque and even making fun of Outsiders right so this is the
1:09:20
mission you could even you know go online and see a lot of those patches and I've known someone to have like uh
1:09:27
at least 150 of these patches whoa yeah so this is a person whose whole life has
1:09:32
been doing this work wow well I think about um the person you pseudonymously
1:09:38
named Tyler in your book and he's this NASA Mission controller it seems like he's using kind of Consciousness
1:09:44
protocols to make the launches work he's this very interesting figure but then he
1:09:49
goes to the Vatican with you and he has this conversion experience and it's almost as if uh what he looks into in
1:09:56
the Vatican archives confirms that his the work that he's been doing is somehow
1:10:03
mystical and like way more like globally meaningful than just this nuts and bolts
1:10:08
like we're putting satellites in space sort of thing yeah that was really an amazing um experience for me to witness
1:10:15
the conversion that he went through uh we started at the Vatican looking at the
1:10:21
the records of uh Joseph of copertino and a and bilocating sister um Maria
1:10:27
agaga and we also had exposure to uh Peter gomel who had been a Papal adviser
1:10:34
he's a Jesuit um talked a lot about the Templars by the way interesting yeah and
1:10:39
um do you remember what he said about the Templars I do okay moving
1:10:46
on so that's where it started so he started to to reexamine his life I guess and I
1:10:53
could see that process cuz I've seen it before and I had a feeling that when we got to Castle Galo at the Vatican
1:11:01
Observatory where he was going to meet astrophysicist monks and you know those people that live like that they have you
1:11:08
know that's their mission and their mission is fused is it fuses religion and science I knew that that that would
1:11:15
be his place and that he would probably convert at that point and I was right so
1:11:21
then we left the Vatican and we went there and then he spent a lot of time the archives looking at Copernicus and
1:11:28
Kepler uh and you know Originals by the way and also uh looking at uh
1:11:36
electromagnetism it's amazing and things like that and I just like could couldn't get him out of the archive just like
1:11:42
glued to these books it's incredible and the other thing I wanted to follow up on from our first interview is you said
1:11:47
this remarkable thing and I kind of like just I don't know I ignored it bad interviewer or in my case or something
1:11:55
because cuz you said this really profound thing you said that when you went with Tyler to the Vatican Observatory they knew who he was before
1:12:02
having gone there and that tripped me out when I was watching it over in the edit because I was like why does the
1:12:09
Vatican Observatory they're obviously very well respected and well staffed when it comes to real astronomy but how
1:12:14
do they know who a NASA Mission controller from the US is yeah not only
1:12:20
that but when we were there we just happened to correspond with a that a trip that
1:12:25
um all these young scientists from Issa so the European Space Agency they were all there too and so brother guy who's
1:12:33
the director go Bri guy consel Mano he was he was giving them um you know a
1:12:38
really awesome tour and talk and everything so he introduced us and so he
1:12:43
introduced me and they were like you know kind of cool clap clap clap and they introduced Tyler with his real name
1:12:51
and the whole place just erupted into this yes like that and that was a
1:12:57
recognition for me that Americans kind of don't know what's going on but they did yeah they were to to them he was a
1:13:05
hero yeah it was really really cool that's incredible the other interesting
1:13:11
connection with Tyler is he met Chris bledo I think or before you yes he did
1:13:16
yeah and they had a relationship and I think uh Ryan bledo who's Chris's son
1:13:22
said that um Tyler had told Chris that
1:13:27
he was part of a group with towns and brown who I just mentioned so towns and Brown's this like fascinating mid-century inventor who I think you
1:13:33
know made more discoveries in the world of gravity than meet the eye you know might have tied gravity and electromagnetism together and that has
1:13:40
implications for time as well because if you can shift gravity at all you can shift time and general relativity and he
1:13:46
would talk in his private life constantly about time travel and so what I I found just so fascinating is Tyler
1:13:53
tells the blood sees that he was involved with a group that was based in NASA and the Bahamas and town and brown
1:14:01
was the president of this group and time travel technology was involved and I would totally discount that and think
1:14:08
that's probably wrong if I didn't know so much about town and brown and I know he spent a ton of time in nasso in the
1:14:14
Bahamas and with a very interesting kind of cast of characters well you know that's so fascinating because when I
1:14:20
knew Tyler he was always he was always talking about time travel and really
1:14:25
yeah whenever a new movie about time travel would come out he would go see it like The Adjustment
1:14:30
Bureau yeah yeah that's fascinating yeah so um I mean
1:14:37
wow that's amazing it seems like we both know so yeah you're kind of like the the
1:14:42
person who talks about uh brown right and then he's an invisible or he was
1:14:48
until you right and then when I met Tyler that's what I thought I thought more people have to know about this
1:14:54
person because he's an invisible but he impacts so much of our history and we don't even
1:15:00
know it that's a way yes I feel the same way I felt like it was my duty or something cuz he he died penniless and
1:15:07
I'm convinced his work made it into the B2 stealth bomber this like Premier you know stealth bomber you know and he was
1:15:13
he was paid off by this Finance here at North Grumman like a ridiculously low sum of money for the rest of his life
1:15:19
and and and then not even that I mean I think he literally like unified the field experimentally and so like that's
1:15:25
so sad everybody knows who even Tes Tesla got ripped off but people know who he is and he has a great car company
1:15:30
named after him today nobody knew who this guy was and and he he created he
1:15:35
was such a patriot he was such an American Patriot you know it was Cold War era and so these discoveries
1:15:41
obviously have implications for you know weaponry and all sorts of other things and so he created tons of disinfo about
1:15:48
his own work to throw people off the trail and so he kind of died pennes in obscurity on Catalina Island w and yeah
1:15:56
so you felt you felt the same Duty with Tyler I don't know what I felt I felt a
1:16:01
sense that you have like a sense of Injustice kind of you know that we want the world to be transparent let me give
1:16:08
you something this can be something that um I think is is relevant um during the
1:16:14
time that I knew Tyler uh there were other people like him Invisibles like I called them the Invisibles right and one
1:16:21
of them had passed away and this is a person whose family didn't even know what they did so there was a big sense
1:16:28
of sadness on their part because they they couldn't eulogize him correctly they felt because they did not know and
The Invisibles
1:16:35
so Tyler actually asked me if I would help them write the eulogy so I did I wrote the eulogy and during the time
1:16:42
period of writing it was so emotional because I was like wow you know how how do I say this you know so I helped them
1:16:49
I helped them write it and uh they really they reached out to me afterwards and they were uh it was consoling to
1:16:56
them yeah because they because someone outside the family recognized their pain that's so amazing wow yeah well do you
1:17:04
think that these Invisibles are sort of outing themselves right now it seems it seems like some yeah it seems like
1:17:09
they're they're done with this kind of life right and they want to but um but
1:17:15
again you know we talked about the reasons why I had to go back and look back at Plato's Republic which was a
1:17:22
text written through trauma the trauma of a government killing Socrates the mentor
1:17:28
of Plato like a teacher who was a wisdom teacher he wasn't doing anybody any harm um so in that context maybe the the
1:17:36
whistleblowers should be should maintain secrecy I don't know I think that uh
1:17:41
it's not a great Outlook to tell you the truth I mean in the long run it is but there's a a a spot that's bad it's
1:17:49
really bad and most of the the time is bad right so Christians are told you know the world world's up not for you
1:17:56
the this place is not for you I mean really that's what Christianity suggests and in a sense that's what Plato's
1:18:02
Republic suggest too because is everybody going to do the dialectic with each other and kind of do no no nobody
1:18:08
cares to do it but so do you see what I'm saying there there are groups of people who do yeah you know does it have
1:18:15
to be for everyone no there's no sort of universal fate and uh one needs to sort
1:18:21
of save themselves and but do that in a sort of maybe communal way I think you have to do it in a
1:18:27
communal way I mean even Buddha said so right he said that there were three keys to Buddhism one is that you can do it
1:18:33
the other one is um the Dharma which is the teaching and the teaching is could be anything right it doesn't have to be
1:18:39
a scripture um it could be an event that teaches you could be having kids by the way you know it's a really great way to
1:18:45
like learn about life and yourself um so there's the Dharma but of course there's the S and you can only do it in a group
1:18:53
because you have each other to help each other that's fascinating well I think
1:18:58
that's a perfect note to end on Diane I really appreciate your time and it's been a great day kind of a marathon and
1:19:05
uh yeah I'm excited to see what happens in both in UFO world but also in the
1:19:10
World At Large because we're in very there's a there's a a confusion proverb you know it's like better to live in
1:19:15
interesting times than good times or something and that's right well we definitely live in interesting yeah we
1:19:21
can rationalize our world by saying that or well anyway thanks for talking with me Jesse it's always fun to talk with
Outro
1:19:27
you it was a blast yeah
