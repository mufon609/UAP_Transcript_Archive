1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
For thousands of years, people have been seeing objects in the sky that they can't identify.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And today, we have somebody who has actually retrieved a UFO first-hand.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A first-hand witness.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The energy is just really good.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's perfect.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
How are you, dude?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A lot of sleep for either of us.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You guys didn't sleep?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I didn't sleep at all.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Why?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm just pumped.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We have five people standing behind cameras right now and nobody knows why we're here.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You didn't tell them?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You didn't tell them?

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Bro.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay, everybody.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Can we have everybody here?

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I just want to let everybody know what we're here for.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Start with just thank you.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Everybody came in on a 36-hour notice for the first time in all these years of doing interviews

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
with UFO-related people.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Today, we're going to be talking to a first-hand witness.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So it's no longer the guy that talked to the guy.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It is the guy himself.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Part of why I'm valuable is because I'm at the fingertips of this thing and everyone

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
people have heard from on a high administrative leadership.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Exactly.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is super dangerous for him right now.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Right now we're in a limbo because the story is supposed to break out on News Nation hopefully

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
this week and every day that it doesn't go live there's more danger in his life.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So tell me about the moment when you realized that you were involved in a retrieval of non-human

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
technology.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I was trained as a pilot a long time ago and the last 20 years I've served more as a pilot

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
than I have as a ground crew member or in any other capacity.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Good morning.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jake, have you retrieved a non-human craft?

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, I have.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
For everyone that's getting exposed to this right now, humble yourself from the perspective

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
of what you consider believable.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Can you describe the retrievals end to end?

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What happens?

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Where are you?

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I sit back at a separate location.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I get GPS coordinates at the very last second.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I get dispatched.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I go there and then in route from very short range out maybe five minutes out I get read

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
a description of what it is I'm picking up.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's so real when you look at it.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's not like in the background you're hearing, oh, there's this light like this is an epic

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
moment.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Where's the crescendo?

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's like no, it's just flying a helicopter, come over a ridge and there's an egg sitting

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
there and dude sitting around on the ground flashing you, calling you in.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It doesn't register as exciting, you know, in that format.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't know, when I'm hearing the story, a big giant 20 foot egg, how do you know that's

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
non-human intelligence?

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Since we've left the program and reorganized and are now working with Aero, I can make the

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
egg show up and we have and we've demonstrated it post program and we did it in August.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh my god.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
In broad daylight.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
At the moment we elicited the egg.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The egg flies by in dead silence, moving at 10,000 miles per hour.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Everyone likes to ask, why am I not afraid that someone's going to try and silence me

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
with death?

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There are people that have died who were coming out and who were speaking out on our activities.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Anybody you know?

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Can you say anything more?

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No, because there's an investigation happening right now.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm not afraid of the boogeyman.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I am the boogeyman.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You don't want to show up at my house and think you're going to be successful with brute

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
force because that's going to go south for you really quickly.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's got this cold military political stigma attached to it, but that's not it.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's not about like flying equipment.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Can we get in a flying saucer and get to London in two minutes or could we get there

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
yesterday because now we know, screw all that.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The real implications are way more powerful.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's realizing that there is something else out there that's maybe not extra at all.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's something that's part of us.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's like outer space versus inner space is all the same.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Different parts of the rain have different activities.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But you know that, don't you?

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Maybe you should interview me.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's up?

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What's up?

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Bogeyman.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
For thousands of years, people have been seeing objects in the sky that they can't identify.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
For maybe the last 80 years, we've been speculating as to American government, other governments

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
involvement with UFOs.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And today we have somebody who has actually retrieved a UFO firsthand, a firsthand witness.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And we have this amazing crew, by the way.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We have Amar present.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We have Logan present.

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And we don't have, you know, we've gotten to know you a little bit over the last month,

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
but we don't have a ton of context as to what exactly you experienced.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And so we want to really get down to the basics and maybe just start with who are you?

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's bring it all the way back to your childhood.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
OK, yeah.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, man, I mean, first thing I should say is like looking back to me, it's clear that the

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
intelligence community looks for kids like me.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I had what you could probably call the four I's, let's say imagination, intellect, intuition

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and instincts.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
My grandfathers were the best men you could ever imagine.

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I had, you know, we could call them Navy Grandpa and Army Grandpa.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let's do that.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So Navy Grandpa was a very influential naval officer.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He was actually a member of the Navy SEALS predecessors, the Scouts and Raiders.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He and my my other grandfather, Army Grandpa, they laid the foundation to our family,

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
literally put the cornerstone in, had their pictures taken in the 50s laying the cornerstone

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
to our family church.

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Up until the point my parents divorced, I had a pretty good childhood.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But when stepfamilies entered the picture, when things became hell for me.

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
How did they become hell?

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The environment in the stepfamily at my mom's house, which is where I spent most of my time,

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
was abusive, physically abusive.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Specifically because of your stepfather?

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Stepfather and stepbrother, his son, who was much older than me.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What sort of abuse?

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I mean, really all three, if there are three, like physically, verbally,

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and like low-key sexually abusive, like borderline sexually abusive, too.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And so I just I chose to like live outside, basically.

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And by the time I got in high school, my Navy Grandpa had encouraged me to get into swimming and water polo.

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And I had also continued to do art and music and had entered a science contest

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and won a state science fair based on a project I had done.

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What was the project?

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's called color chords.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And in my music class, we had learned at a very rudimentary level this thing called the circles of fifths,

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
which is basically a pie chart where you can break down and learn the intervals of harmonies.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Basically, you got a root note from any root note of what's called a perfect fifth.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And that fifth rings a harmony, which is pleasant.

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There's also a third.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And in a major chord, you have a first, a third, and a fifth.

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
In a minor chord, you have a first, a minor third, which is a half interval down.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But you keep that major fifth.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And it it makes what people refer to as like a sad sound or sad.

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But they're both beautiful.

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's more of a happy beautiful than like a deeper, dramatic beautiful.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So the understanding of harmony in the sound world is when wavelengths overlap in a way that forms some form of geometry

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
that is enhancing rather than degrading to the independent waveforms, you get something like harmony.

143
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And your ear can pick that up and your emotions can react to it in a variety of ways.

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So I'm like, well, shoot.

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If photons make waveforms, are there color combinations that can have that same complementary interplay

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
or when the colors combined that they're pleasant?

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And could it be that they actually elicit the exact same emotions?

148
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It was really cool.

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I did well in our local area and I kept I went on to county and then I went on to the state

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and I got awarded with like 10 other kids an award at the state level for that project.

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, you are you talk about trauma being a part of what the intelligence community was looking for.

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah. Let's get into the juicy stuff, which is the Air Force recruiting you.

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah. How did they recruit you?

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How did you get in touch?

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So when I got expelled my senior year, my grandfather pulled some strings and got me into another high school.

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
My parents were involved in that process, but unbeknownst to my parents,

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I also had this secret intervention with my grandfathers.

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Both of them came together and they began exploring military opportunities for me.

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They like they just saw that that's what I needed.

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And for me, I was like, yeah, I want to jump out airplanes and kill bad people like I'm all in.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Just I want that job. I don't want to do like a desk job or cook.

162
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And so they set out, made phone calls.

163
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And, you know, looking back, I don't think they had any idea what they were getting me into.

164
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I mean, I didn't either. I don't blame them.

165
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's not like they were complicit or part of some deep state and like put their grandson up for offering to the program.

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It wasn't like that. But, you know, I took some initial screening in our local area.

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And then we traveled down by UCLA and I went through a series of tests over multiple visits, like all your basic stuff.

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I mean, physical stuff, physiological, but then went into psychological testing, creative testing.

169
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So I went down and the first time I'd ever taken an IQ test.

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So you take it two times, at least twice, but two different ways, I'll say.

171
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The first time I took it, I think it was just a straight up IQ test.

172
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And I remember knowing exactly what I got because I was so interested to find out.

173
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And it was like one thirty eight.

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And I was like, oh, that kind of sucks. Like, that's not very high.

175
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's pretty high.

176
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm like, you're not supposed to be smarter than that. Hundreds average.

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But then they do the second thing, which is a stress IQ test.

178
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And so you take the same test.

179
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But I put on this oxygen mask that sealed my face with no air coming to it. Whoa.

180
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And I took that test and I tested a one fifty two. No way. So scored higher.

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I scored way higher under stress.

182
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And that's when my concept for comfort and chaos began to form.

183
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And I was like, oh, like I'm a different person.

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm like, see things more clearly, like I see the code or whatever.

185
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Like under stress, it's like things make more sense to me.

186
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Anybody watching this is probably thinking this is a very unique recruiting process for the military.

187
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
This isn't like going online, submitting an application.

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What did you end up getting recruited?

189
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah. So I ended up getting recruited to a brand new program that was called GTEP,

190
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
which was a guaranteed training education program.

191
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I believe is what the acronym was at the time.

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And for me, this was a 10 year contract that would fast track me through special operations training

193
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
through the Department of the Air Force, through a career field at the time called combat control.

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's still called combat control.

195
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And what's interesting for people to probably know, which moving forward, keep this in the back of your mind,

196
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
is that the Air Force is this agency that's straddled the blue black line, let's call it,

197
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
since its inception in 1947, like two weeks after Roswell incident.

198
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You get the National Security Act, you get the formation of the Air Force, CIA at the same time,

199
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Department of Defense, and the Air Force has been that agency that's straddled the blue black line ever since.

200
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And just to be clear for the audience, the blue black line, the blue is the kind of open source white world,

201
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
out in the open black world is highly cleared, sensitive stuff. Is that right?

202
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah. I think the good way to think about it is the black world that we operate in

203
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
is like a four dimensional projection into a three dimensional world.

204
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It has its presence here and there's indications of it, but you're not going to get it

205
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
because so much of what you're seeing is tied and connected to other things through another dimension you're not paying attention to.

206
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And that's how this exists, that's how we exist, and that's how we manipulate reality and truth

207
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and get away with things that people don't understand.

208
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That is unbelievable. You sound like Carl Sagan describing platonic stars.

209
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah, I don't mean to be.

210
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're describing an elite military unit.

211
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, what I need to make very clear is although I was prospected into combat control,

212
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I became something very different and that was simply my gateway into the program.

213
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So I signed a contract for combat control in 1994 and shipped off to basic training in Texas.

214
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
After completing basic training at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas,

215
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I then was shipped out to a place called Operating Location Hotel, which we called OLH,

216
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and this was a selection or Air Force Special Warfare Combat Control Pararescue.

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And although I had been pre-screened and signed this crazy 10-year contract

218
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
that guaranteed this 17-year-old kid two and a half years of specialized training,

219
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
which to understand how incredible that is is traditionally or I should say historically

220
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
for special warfare or special operations like military-wide,

221
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
you don't get into those programs without first being enlisted

222
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and then earning your selection and being recommended for special units.

223
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And then even once you're in those special units,

224
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
what specialized schools you go to is not guaranteed and it happens over a period of time.

225
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So after I graduated selection, which is the initial phase of weeding out candidates,

226
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
it's about a four-week course at OLH.

227
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We had a class of about 89 people, I remember,

228
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and nine of my original classmates graduated together from that class.

229
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And then we shipped off to what we call the pipeline,

230
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
which is our trade schools where we learn our craft.

231
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Somewhere early on in the pipeline, I was approached by two individuals

232
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
who convinced me that it would be a good idea if I became an airplane mechanic.

233
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Can you say anything more about those two individuals?

234
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
One of them was clearly gay,

235
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
which was interesting because I quite enjoyed the talk.

236
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I thought it was fun.

237
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And for some reason, I've always been really compatible with gay men,

238
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
much to their disappointment because I'm very straight as an arrow with my sexual orientation.

239
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So there's that. I can share that.

240
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And they had sold me on the idea.

241
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They sold me on this idea and ultimately what it was,

242
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I knew I was doing something different and special.

243
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And you have to understand in the 90s, the op tempo was really low.

244
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And everyone kind of knew like you would go through your training,

245
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
but a lot of guys that once they made it to their teams were kind of like,

246
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
dude, let's go, let's go to war.

247
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And there was no war.

248
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And so a lot of people were getting out tired of just training.

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And what was kind of sold to this young, crazy kid, Jacob Barber,

250
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
was that you're going to get to do things others aren't going to get to do.

251
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
There is a lot going on that we'd like to use you for,

252
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
but you first have to go do this thing for us.

253
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And that is learning how to be an airplane mechanic.

254
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So I'm like, okay.

255
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I then shipped off to airplane mechanic school.

256
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Upon completing that,

257
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I reported directly to Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina.

258
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
When I was there, you know,

259
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I spent a lot of time turning wrenches on the flight line as a mechanic.

260
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But outside of that, I spent all my time training.

261
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Was that a hazing ritual or would that come in handy with what you were ultimately going to do?

262
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What was a hazing ritual?

263
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Like just learning to become an airplane mechanic.

264
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
No, it was my cover.

265
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Okay.

266
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So my cover was working as an airplane mechanic.

267
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I came in during the Clinton era and that's no coincidence.

268
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That had a lot to do with this program and what I became.

269
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Come to find out.

270
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I spent a lot of time deploying on those type of missions in support of President Clinton.

271
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I can explain.

272
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I can go to detail there a little bit.

273
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I was involved in Bosnia.

274
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I deployed to Bosnia.

275
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I was involved in liberation of Kuwait.

276
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I had a lot of combat time.

277
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But ultimately, what I was being refined for was a red teamer.

278
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I became a red team expert.

279
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Red team you could think of is an opposition force.

280
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
In fact, that's exactly what we call it is for opposition force.

281
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And red teams job in any scenario is to exploit all the weaknesses of blue team and find the vulnerabilities and then use those against blue team.

282
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So in an exercise, we would participate where the military's blue forces or traditional forces would deploy their tactics.

283
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And then we would be set out to play the opponent or the enemy.

284
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And we're given liberty, boundless liberty on how to just go and fuck up their life, like try and make their life hell.

285
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You get to be creative, think outside the box, innovate ways and find holes in our systems.

286
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So we'd go out and it was a lot of fun and we'd find ways to completely disrupt the standard operating procedures of units.

287
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And then in exercises that were global and dealt very closely with other subject matter related to UAP, we're involved with those and had to come up with innovative ways to to be adversarial towards our own forces.

288
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And I found out that like my four eyes that I explained earlier were tools of war.

289
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And, you know, anyone that's read the art of war, you know, what's the first rule in the art of war?

290
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You know, what is the first rule? Deception. Deception.

291
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Deception is the first rule in the art of war is to deceive and to always act like something you're not.

292
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Now I think about it, that's probably alarming coming from me right now.

293
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That guy is full of shit.

294
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
How do we know you're not red teaming us right now?

295
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Well, you don't. You don't know that. You really don't.

296
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That was an honest answer.

297
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah, you don't know that. So I and all I can do, I expect to get asked that a lot.

298
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's like, you know, I'll paraphrase a book from Matthew.

299
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I think it is like you will know me by my fruits.

300
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And so just pay attention to what's happening.

301
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You can evaluate the impact of what I'm doing.

302
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And that's all you can do.

303
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Well, that's an amazing message for the audience too,

304
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
which is they should corroborate the things that you're saying through their own open source research.

305
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And if it validates checks, they should think for themselves and not just, you know, take all of us for our word.

306
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
No.

307
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You mentioned other things being sort of adjacent to UFO or UAP retrievals.

308
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What were the other things you were doing as part of this group?

309
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:27,000
While while enlisted, I did a lot of security and escort of HVTs, which are called high value targets.

310
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So I held a NATO top secret security clearance at times when I needed to and was manifested to classified flights where we would be dispatched.

311
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We would secure targets and transport those targets and deliver them to other places and then hand them off to other teams.

312
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
These targets most of the time were like sealed containers.

313
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We called them mystery boxes. I couldn't tell you what was inside.

314
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It could be a variety of things.

315
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:04,000
There was a variety of sizes, something small enough that could fit on a helicopter, something large enough that it had to be put on a C5 Galaxy.

316
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Sometimes it had to be trucked.

317
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Sometimes it had to be taken in pieces, but it was always put in the little mystery boxes.

318
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:27,000
One one thing that should be noted is that one of these missions I was involved in, I got very sick afterwards and lost every hair on my body, skin peeled off my arms.

319
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I was nauseous and I was it was obvious in hindsight that I was exposed most likely to some form of radiation.

320
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And this really upsets some people when I tell this story, especially friends like Dr. Gary Nolan, who helps me with with this issue now.

321
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But real quick, just for the audience, Gary Nolan is a Stanford microbiologist.

322
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
He's a Nobel nominee every year.

323
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
He's tenured there and he's incredibly interested in the UFO subject.

324
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
In fact, he claims to have, and I've seen them actually, crash retrieval parts from his friend.

325
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
He's a longtime kind of the godfather of UFO research, a guy named Jacques Valais, and Gary does mass spectrometry on them.

326
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But he also was approached by the CIA in 2016-ish around people who have encountered UAP, NHI, and the biological effects that they've heard.

327
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And that's that's the nature of my relationship with Gary.

328
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So, Dr. Nolan, yeah, I now I'm still suffering from that experience, most likely, and subsequent experiences.

329
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And it's only now that I'm getting proper care because of how I want to say this because I don't want to make the Air Force out to be this evil, irresponsible entity, because as much as they are, they also aren't.

330
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
In this one circumstance, I don't believe they knew what we were dealing with.

331
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:15,000
This is why I think that one incident and looking back with 20-20 vision, hindsight, you know, it's likely that was also related to the UAP topic because had we known what was in that box, we would have there.

332
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
We have a protocol for dealing with nuclear hazmat and and none of that was in place.

333
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And I still got exposed.

334
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So I think something in that box that were you carrying the box?

335
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
No, we don't. OK, it's too heavy.

336
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's it's loaded on the craft.

337
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
We asked for it. We asked for it.

338
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And we protect it with the authority to use deadly force.

339
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And it was emitting that much radiological energy.

340
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I think it got turned on at some point, which is another interesting thing.

341
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Like, how did it come on while we were in air?

342
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Like, it turned on or turned off or there was some level of fallout.

343
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I really don't know.

344
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What makes you think that it was a UAP or UFO and not like an electromagnetic pulse like some of these exotic weaponry that emit radiological energy?

345
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah. Well, EMPs are different.

346
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
A lot of the HPMs are safe to be around.

347
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You're not you're not going to get high doses of gamma radiation by exposing yourself to EMP.

348
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
But I would just say let's not get too much into this night in this mission without getting into trouble.

349
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But I'll just tell you that I don't blame the Air Force or anyone for how that was handled,

350
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
except with the exception of the fact of seeking medical treatment afterwards.

351
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I couldn't talk about what had happened.

352
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So therefore, the causation was really difficult for doctors to like to come up with.

353
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
There was there was symptomology without causation.

354
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And I was treated for things that weren't necessarily consistent with radiation poisoning.

355
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And I healed up from it.

356
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
What were all of the symptoms that you experienced?

357
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So like I end up now.

358
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I mean, I have a heart murmur that I never had before.

359
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So my heart's messed up.

360
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Again, I lost all the hair on my body.

361
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I look like just a albino lizard, dude, like no pubic hair, no eyebrows, no nose hair,

362
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
which I wish was still the case, but whatever.

363
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So one benefit.

364
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yeah, one benefit.

365
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
No ear hair, no nose hair.

366
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I had rashes.

367
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
My immune system seems compromised in some way that I can't explain.

368
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I just have random autoimmune disorders.

369
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And so this was where Gary has come in handy is that he's reviewed my medical records

370
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and we're trying to make sense of 20 years of things that have happened

371
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
and how it how more so like, you know, forget the past, like moving forward.

372
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
My concern is that there's some, you know, hidden gremlin that's going to show up later in life.

373
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
We're going to be way behind on how to deal with, you know, cancer or whatever.

374
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I hate to throw that term around.

375
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Knock on wood, man.

376
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yeah. So but so that incident, just to get back to the subject.

377
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Can I ask you one more question?

378
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
When Gary took a look at your, you know, physical chart and the symptoms,

379
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
did he say they accorded with other UFO experiencers?

380
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah, he did.

381
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Specifically, what's the guy from Rendlesham Forest in 1980?

382
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
John Burroughs.

383
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
John Burroughs and Jim Peniston.

384
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
John Burroughs had had similar symptoms that I did and had similar issues with his VA records as I did.

385
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So he also had scarring in his dorsal striatum.

386
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
He had scarring in his caudate nucleus and pitamen.

387
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah.

388
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Did you have that?

389
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I haven't. I still have to get my comprehensive MRIs.

390
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Like, I haven't had a brain MRI that's revealed that.

391
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But I do know he had a heart issue.

392
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yeah, we have the same heart issue.

393
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Oh, wow.

394
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It didn't exist before in either of us.

395
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That was the one thing that Gary shared.

396
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And it was, you know, similar, similar situation with the records.

397
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And for context, for people, the Rendlesham Forest incident was, I think, 1980.

398
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah.

399
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It was Suffolk, Royal Air Force, Medwaters.

400
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And it was, you had Jim Peniston, Burroughs, all these guys who were, they saw this, like, blight in the forest.

401
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yeah.

402
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Dude, that one incident, this is we were talking earlier about how things get lost over time in this environment,

403
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
how keyed up we are right now for proof.

404
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And there's a lot of attention on this.

405
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
If that incident, if Bentwaters happened today or tomorrow, case would be closed.

406
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
But that single incident has all the proof and evidence that you need that this thing is real from a public perspective,

407
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
from a firsthand witness, from a government response and cover up.

408
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Like, it's there.

409
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It's there. It's a closed book.

410
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You have Lord Norton, who is the head of the naval fleet for the entire UK, saying that this, you know, was a thing.

411
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
This happened.

412
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And it simply isn't any good.

413
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Ministers and the Ministry of Defense in particular saying that nothing that took place that December night in Suffolk is of defense interest.

414
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It simply isn't true.

415
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And you had Colonel Charles Halt as well.

416
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh, yeah.

417
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,640
And then you had the

418
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,000
HVT escort team show up, haul everything away.

419
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
People are sworn to secrecy.

420
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:29,000
People are are drugged during interrogation, post interrogation of the I mean, they're given truth serum.

421
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
They're given sodium pentothal so that they basically give like an extremely explicit readout of what actually occurred.

422
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And that itself didn't take place in a vacuum.

423
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You have a great book called UFOs and nukes by a guy named Robert Hastings, 167 ICBM security personnel, radar operators, guys that work at these nuclear bases across the United States.

424
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And in some cases, they're joint nuclear bases in the UK and other places.

425
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And they all experience these things, these these orbs, disks, plasma balls, crazy sorts of things.

426
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
In certain cases, they claim to have boarded crafts.

427
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:22,000
If anybody if anybody out there wants a good starting point to take an on ramp into this subject matter, I recommend going to the what was called the citizens hearings in 2013.

428
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's on YouTube.

429
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's a it's a full week of what's essentially a mock congressional hearing where they brought in there's over 20 hours of testimony over five days at that time.

430
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Everyone from academia, government, military enthusiasts, all those areas that have expertise and experiences documented.

431
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And they come and they testified a very professional formal setting before I think former and current congressional members.

432
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And they lay it all out. It's the whole history.

433
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And Bentwater's incident is covered in there.

434
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Something about that is irritating because it's like, OK, where are all the whistleblowers?

435
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Let's wait until they come out. Like, no, they've come out.

436
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
They have come out like the time.

437
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
If you want to form a vehement argument that's anti whatever this subject is, put in the work to go look like.

438
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah, like Ross's book in plain sight.

439
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
There's so much that's already in plain sight. It's already happened.

440
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's in plain sight. Jake, have you retrieved a nonhuman craft?

441
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yes, I have. OK, let's get into that. All right.

442
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
What's the story behind that? Man, so here we go.

443
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So after 9-11, I went back to California and I began going to work on the next chapter of my life,

444
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
which is working as a contractor for the broader intelligence community.

445
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And so everyone else after 9-11 was looking east with vengeance.

446
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And the special operations community went crazy, which kind of served as like the perfect distraction for me and my work,

447
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
because nobody was looking domestically. Nobody was looking out west.

448
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And we continued to do our work out here.

449
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And I quite literally took a left turn at Albuquerque to quote Bugs Bunny.

450
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I knew I should have taken that left turn at Albuquerque.

451
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And we had a cover contract through the BIA, which is the Bureau of Indian Affairs,

452
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
at a sovereign nation close to White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.

453
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And lest the audience be skeptical of this left turn into Indian reservations,

454
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
there's actually a long history of the American intelligence community's activity on Indian reservations.

455
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You actually watch a really popular Netflix show right now called The Octopus Murders,

456
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
which involves all sorts of activity with whack-and-hut private security contractor on Native American lands.

457
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And it's a somewhat common thing.

458
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Well, it's a good place to go if there's a lot of security and ambiguity there from a structure standpoint.

459
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And something important to understand is that the legitimacy is the best cover.

460
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
This is something we say all the time.

461
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So if I'm going to put my public face or my structured face or my three-dimensional identity out there,

462
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
it's got to be a legitimate work.

463
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And I spend most of my time doing that.

464
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So I specialize in security and transportation,

465
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
mostly in aeronautical operations, even more specifically helicopters.

466
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm basically a helicopter operations expert and security expert.

467
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So I stood up and got involved with helicopter operating companies

468
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and held many contracts with the DOD, Department of Interior, State Department, and other local agencies as well.

469
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And through that work, we basically, although the majority of our time was spent doing the day-to-day work

470
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and keeping that business up and going, our real purpose was to make ourselves available for the call, let's say,

471
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
or the calls that would come in.

472
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And we would be put to work on missions for the program.

473
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And because of my experience working as a Red Team member and already having the clearances

474
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and already having proved myself, I don't know how to say it other than certain individuals were passing my business card around.

475
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And it's a lot of work maintaining aptitude and currency and a variety of skills

476
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and legitimate civilian licenses and things and credentials.

477
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
What's your title at this point?

478
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Do you have a title?

479
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Are you a full kind of ghost?

480
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm a lot of things, so I don't know how to answer that.

481
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I mean, at this point, take a left turn to Albuquerque, dealing with the Department of Interior, what's your job title?

482
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Director of Operations for a helicopter company.

483
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Wow.

484
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah.

485
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Crazy.

486
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yeah.

487
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Interesting.

488
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Yeah, so I'm Director of Operations for a helicopter company.

489
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I'm Program Director for Gracie Jujitsu NorCal.

490
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Wow.

491
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm a flight instructor for law enforcement, for Airborne Law Enforcement Agency.

492
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I held a lot of titles.

493
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm also the president of a corporation that has manufacturers' wheelchairs, patented wheelchair parts for the Veterans Hospital.

494
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I service fitness centers on a number of key military bases that if I named them, they'd make a lot of sense to you.

495
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So I'm a lot of different things.

496
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
You're like an Uber driver in L.A., but way more badass.

497
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I think I'm more badass than an Uber driver at this point.

498
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
There are some badass Uber drivers, I don't know.

499
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
The most insane multi-hyphenate ever.

500
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So at this point, having all these different potential covers is what's actually serving you and what you're doing,

501
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
because you could be a flight instructor at this company, or you could be just directing operations for some transportation.

502
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Can you say anything about the companies that you worked for in the context of these UFO crash retrievals?

503
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Look, man, if you took two guesses, you'd get both of them right on the first try.

504
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
There you go.

505
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
At the end of the day, I'm just a security and transportation guy, especially when it gets to the UAP subject.

506
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
We did a lot of helicopter work and law enforcement and security work.

507
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's not like we understand the idea of a paramedic sitting over here in an ambulance waiting for a call who specializes in emergency medical response.

508
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's like we're not sitting there as a crash recovery team with our little CR patch on our chest and our little alien-like dice hanging from the rearview mirror of the helicopter.

509
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
We're ready to roll when the alien phone rings.

510
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
No, it's like we're doing other shit, and we're going to go out and we do a lot of recovery.

511
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
It's not just exotic craft. We recover all kinds of things.

512
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
When a call would come in, typically it meant we were going out to what I call the range, which is in the desert of California.

513
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:49,000
We would be there to support from a security and transportation standpoint the operations out there.

514
00:37:49,000 --> 00:38:07,000
The range was a giant playground for Department of Defense and its private aerospace partners for testing weapons technology, radar technology, experimental craft, and that crafts resilience to radar and weapons technology and vice versa.

515
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It was during this work when I'm here to talk about two different experiences with exotic craft that was non-human in origin.

516
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It was during some of this time out on the range when I had these experiences.

517
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:30,000
The first experience I'm going to talk about is when we recovered an egg, and we just call it the egg because that's what it was.

518
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It was like a giant white egg.

519
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
The night that this happened, we weren't expecting an egg. I wasn't briefed on an egg.

520
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:54,000
When this happened, it was a surprise to everyone. I can tell you within not only my leadership structure, which is most concerning when they're surprised, but also everyone around me on my team.

521
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:09,000
When this happened, we had to go, we altered our communication protocol, we altered our security protocol, and it was obvious to everyone that what we were dealing with was something extraordinary.

522
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:22,000
My job that night was as a helicopter pilot. I was not on the ground. I was called in to transport that egg via external load, what we call external load or through a long line,

523
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:30,000
which is 150 foot, sometimes 200 foot long line that hangs below the helicopter. It has a remote hook on it.

524
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,000
That remote hook can be attached to hardware that secures the load, and then we fly that load away to drop point.

525
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And from there, it goes wherever it's going to go on a secure transport.

526
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Did you see this egg?

527
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I saw it. Absolutely.

528
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
What did it look like?

529
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It's probably 20 feet plus or minus, I don't know, 10%.

530
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:01,000
From my point of view, you know, I was 150 feet from it, had 150 foot long line that night, hovered right over it, hooked up to it.

531
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It looked like a giant.

532
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
20 feet longitudinally?

533
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Yeah, 20 feet longitudinally, spherical with a little bit of an asymmetrical three dimensional rounding shape to it is like a pearly white.

534
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's like, I don't know if it was wet or moist, but it wasn't like flat white. It was like pearly white.

535
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Granted, this is at night at this point. It was after civil twilight, so it's dark.

536
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm flying under NVG's, but there was enough lunar illumination that I could see it with the naked eye.

537
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
What's an NVG?

538
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Night vision goggle. So it's an enhanced omni-electronic system that takes into account IR light.

539
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
But you could see it outside.

540
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I could see it. I could flip my goggles up and see it, flip my goggles down and see it. It was secured with nets, basically.

541
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It was secured with nets.

542
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And somebody wrapped nets around it? Somebody on your team?

543
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah, someone on the ground team.

544
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Wow. And did they sort of touch the craft while they were wrapping nets around it?

545
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
The team there must have touched it, yeah.

546
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And did they experience any effects?

547
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Not that I know. I didn't talk much. It was compartmentalization on steroids that night, so I didn't debrief with the ground crew much.

548
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:34,000
There's a few guys on the ground crew that we've talked to since, but a lot of the details of everyone's experience weren't shared, necessarily.

549
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Any other core details about the craft? The weight? Any symbology on it?

550
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:51,000
No. I mean, it was smooth, seamless, no symbology. I could tell it was less than 5,000 pounds, because that was the capacity of my helicopter at that time.

551
00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I don't remember exactly what it weighed. When we fly in to recover a load or to pick, we use the term pick, which is I'm going to connect and pull something off no matter what it is.

552
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I get a briefing on the way in as to what my load is going to be. I get disclosed its approximate weight, dimensions, and then I get a hazmat disclosure as to whether or not there's any hazmat on board or if there are any soles on board, which is life forms.

553
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:47,000
That night, there was no disclosure for hazmat or soles on board, or what we call SOBs, soles on board. It was just an object and took it to a drop point, which was about 15 miles away, and set it down very carefully, and it was hauled off somewhere, and that was the end of it.

554
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Why do you think it landed on a human flight testing range? I could see a skeptic in the audience saying, oh, awfully convenient that you're landing right next to wherever you guys are operating.

555
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yeah, well, it wasn't next. It actually went off the range, which was added to part of our challenge, and I can't tell you where it landed, but it was tracked and intercepted over the range, and by the time it finally interfaced with the ground, it was off the playground, which complicated our recovery.

556
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Would another possible answer to that be that UAPs are attracted to sensitive military sites?

557
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:43,000
We know exactly what they're attracted to, and we intentionally attract them, and when I say we, anyone that's out playing around with this kind of stuff knows that there are things that they are attracted to.

558
00:43:43,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Whether or not that was intentional, that was the primary objective that night. I don't know. I can tell you that that night there was another team present that I know of that deals with the summoning component of data collection, and that team's intention usually is or known to be associated with summoning or getting a UAP or non-human craft to show up.

559
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Question from the audience. Was the egg sitting upright when you pulled up on it?

560
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Oh, it was flat. Yeah, horizontal.

561
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Did it appear like it crashed, or did it land and fall over?

562
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:36,000
It didn't look messed up to me, and there was no disturbed earth around it. It's not like it toe-picked in or like, you know, dug in.

563
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I guess just like, I don't know, when I'm hearing the story, a big giant 20-foot egg, how do you know that's non-human intelligence?

564
00:44:48,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Okay, that's a great question. So I've got three different reasons or criteria for determining that it was NHI.

565
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:15,000
One, relying on myself as an expert of not only what flies around in our skies, but even at the extreme of advanced technologies and capabilities within the U.S.

566
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
government at the highest level in private industry and seeing those things fly around and operate at the range all the time.

567
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:30,000
This is why it was kind of a process for me up until very shortly after the egg, because still the night of the egg is just like you get called in.

568
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Everyone's a little nervous, but it's so real when you look at it. It's like, it's not like in the background you're hearing, oh, and there's this light from heaven.

569
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Like you grew up on movies. It's like, this is an epic moment. Where's the crescendo?

570
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It's like, no, it's just flying a helicopter, come over a ridge, there's an egg sitting there and dude sitting around on the ground flashing you, calling you in while you're flying your hook.

571
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm like, where's all the intensity? It's like it's so blatant and in your face and so real, it can almost, it doesn't register as exciting, you know, in that format.

572
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Now, I'm sure the experience of running into an alien in your bedroom is not that way, but I've never had that experience, so I don't know.

573
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:25,000
But what I'm getting at is, you know, for me, it was a process up to there because so many things we see in the sky out at the range are fantastical.

574
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It's like you see things change shape, change color, come in to sight, go out of sight, travel at extreme speeds, appear to go and come from the earth or the mountain or a ridge.

575
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And you just assume most of the time that what you're seeing is our own advanced tech or cloaking systems or projections or light artifacts of weapon systems.

576
00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And then you've just got from, you know, just from being outside at night in the desert, which I could invite anyone to go spend some time out night just looking up with your dumb human eyeballs and you're going to see some weird stuff.

577
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So we've seen a lot of stuff and that night, number one, it was not expected.

578
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So if it was human, there would have been a much different response to it.

579
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:24,000
There would have been some expectation that what we were working that on that night may have may have not responded well to the radar that was being thrown at it.

580
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
We would have expected a crash and was like, OK, we would have been trained on how to deal with that.

581
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
No one was trained on how to deal with that and everybody acted really weird.

582
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So then there's that localized response that was anomalous.

583
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And if there's any human on Earth that's going to know what that is and how to deal with it, it would have been me and my team.

584
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And we didn't know. There's no one else like, oh, shit, I need to call in the specialized team.

585
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Look, behind me, I see a picture of myself like that.

586
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
OK, so like I'm the guy.

587
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Subsequent to that, it was also confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP task force that that is exactly what we ran into that night that that was NHI.

588
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And they they told me bluntly that, yes, that is a nonhuman anomalous craft.

589
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:24,000
The last or the third reason reasoning I'll give you is that since we've left the program and reorganized and are now working with Aero, I can make the egg show up.

590
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And we have and we've demonstrated it post program and we did it in August.

591
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Oh, my God.

592
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Really? So you can summon.

593
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Yes, we can summon the egg.

594
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
That is absurd.

595
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It seems absurd, but we've tracked it in broad daylight.

596
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
The egg moving at ten thousand miles per hour.

597
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
So based on range.

598
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And it comes when we've had a precise timing when we've asked for.

599
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
We're doing demonstrations for the new director of Aero.

600
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
They're fully privy. They've seen our videos.

601
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
They've seen our data report.

602
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And Aero is the all domain anomaly resolution resolutions office.

603
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
We have classes of UAP.

604
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
There's a number of classes and categories that we've how many more than eight.

605
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Do you know more than eight?

606
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Yes.

607
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Can you list them?

608
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
No, no.

609
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Maybe soon we can.

610
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Going back to the retrieval.

611
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So I'm saying this and not you because you don't want to, you know, reveal anything classified.

612
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I've done deep dives on American antigravity research, exotic electromagnetic propulsion.

613
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And I even just interviewed the former deputy CTO of Northrop Grumman,

614
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
who was actually part of the UAP Task Force, the Army representative guy named Carl Nell.

615
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And I said, you know, is any of this crazy UFO stuff investable or actionable?

616
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
We're speaking to a room full of entrepreneurs.

617
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And he said, go watch Jesse's video on Thomas Townsend Brown.

618
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
OK.

619
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And so to me, that is as much confirmation as we're ever probably going to get for a little bit,

620
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:11,000
at least on the idea that we do have exotic propulsion human craft in our possession.

621
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So is there anything else that gives you conviction?

622
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Let me let me go into that.

623
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So let me go into the analysis that was presented to Arrow and why they're why they consider it NHI.

624
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So best way to explain this.

625
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:37,000
We set out specifically to summon the egg and record gather sensor data on the egg.

626
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:44,000
At the moment, we expected or elicited the egg.

627
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It shows up moving so fast we couldn't see with the naked eye.

628
00:50:49,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Another object also showed up at that time that our our our guy operating our top observer saw this object.

629
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It burnt the sensor in his camera.

630
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And we had another camera, luckily, that was also recording.

631
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But where the first object showed up, the sensor was damaged.

632
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:21,000
So behind that, the egg flies by in dead silence, makes a turn and comes around into land and disappears behind the house.

633
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So that wasn't done when we did that most recent exercise.

634
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
That wasn't done on the range in coordination with the DOD or any private partners.

635
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
It was done with me and the team we've assembled since then.

636
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And with we have all the tools and talents and techniques that we did in the legacy program.

637
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And now we're doing them on our own.

638
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I would say legacy program, legacy UFO program.

639
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Yeah.

640
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
You know, legacy is kind of a loaded term.

641
00:51:48,000 --> 00:52:00,000
But I would say in everyone's prior scope of work and career fields, they've worked and they've worked in this capacity and have had these experiences.

642
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And now, but doing it on the payroll and under the NDA obligations of the federal government as private partners.

643
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
A lot of us have left those those jobs.

644
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I'm no longer doing that work.

645
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I'm no longer connected in the same way I was.

646
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And since then, we've formed our own organization and we have all the tools and talent that we had back then.

647
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,000
But we have it in a private venture and we're doing our own exploration.

648
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And who's we?

649
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
We is Skywatcher Technologies is a company we formed.

650
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,000
What you're basically saying at a fundamental level is I think one of the biggest critiques of the UFO phenomena is that it's completely ephemeral.

651
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And you're saying it's actually repeatable.

652
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Science needs to be repeatable.

653
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Wrap your knuckles on it.

654
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Like some of the stuff is like I'm not kidding, like a physical craft.

655
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Every time I drop this pen, it's going to hit the ground.

656
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And what you're saying is that every time you do these sort of summoning techniques and then there's like a more physical version.

657
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Luis Elizondo whistleblower, who was involved in the OSAP program, writes in his book that they contemplating baiting UFOs with nuclear material.

658
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So that's something that's kind of open source and in public record.

659
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
It's not all tangible.

660
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Drop the pen.

661
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It hits the ground.

662
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:37,000
That's why there are eight or more classes of UAP in our work, because it ranges from the supernatural like ground based paranormal phenomenon to what looks like objects in the sky.

663
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And Gary Nolan, he's on our team.

664
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
He's been there in the desert when we've summoned the eight.

665
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Wow.

666
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
In broad daylight.

667
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So you brought Gary Nolan out.

668
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah, he's part of our new team.

669
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
So a Nobel nominated Stanford professor has seen this occur.

670
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
He's he's born witness to this.

671
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
He didn't see it with his own eyes because no one did is moving too fast.

672
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
But he's seen the report and our sense of data or sensor data afterwards.

673
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
All this information that I'm giving you, including our reports, has all been given to Arrow and we can get into that.

674
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:19,000
But this incident and the future incidents that have happened that we're going to talk about, you know, in the last five years, all of this has been disclosed to, you know, I've spent a lot of times speaking.

675
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:34,000
One thing I wanted to do was to do this the right way was to give our institutions and our authorities a chance to hear this stuff first and to reconcile it and to do the right thing with it and primarily give me guidance on what to do with it moving forward.

676
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:48,000
So, you know, everything I'm telling you and more has been shared with Congress in a skip in a top secret TSCI environment where I've given testimony.

677
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Real quick, a skip is a secure compartmentalized information facility, basically a Faraday cage.

678
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Yeah.

679
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
No, no, no signals in or out.

680
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
No.

681
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
And then TSCI is top secret compartmentalized information.

682
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Yeah, secure compartment.

683
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Yes.

684
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And what's funny, I don't I mean, I'm a kid from the 70s.

685
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
But if you remember the show Mork from Mork and Mindy, Robin Williams was one of his first roles.

686
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
He wore the suspenders.

687
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
The story goes and they show it in the preview of that show.

688
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And it's part of every show is this white egg.

689
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
He flew to Earth in this white egg.

690
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And at night, I think he would like go to sleep in this egg and she'd be like, good night.

691
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
And he'd go be like, Nanu, Nanu.

692
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And he'd go sleep in this egg.

693
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And I'm like, bro, like how much of our culture is like, is that did someone know?

694
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Well, the egg as a form has shown up a few times in quote unquote ufology.

695
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,000
You have Lonnie Zamora, Socorro, New Mexico, 1964, where he's this police officer.

696
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
He sees this egg actually land, sees burnt vegetation in the area.

697
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
James Fox made this amazing movie called Moment of Contact.

698
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Everybody in this little town in Brazil reports seeing an egg landing.

699
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It seems to be emitting this sort of like ammonia like thing and even seems to kill a doctor.

700
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's pretty crazy.

701
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
So the egg thing does show up.

702
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
That's one thing I just wanted to mention.

703
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Like sometimes I feel like truth is actually stranger than fiction.

704
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And a lot of times like these these tales, the stories are influenced by something we've seen in real life or heard about or sounded too crazy to actually believe.

705
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And one thing I've been looking at in this space is the commonalities between what people are seeing.

706
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And you just described there being eight or more different types of UAPs.

707
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
And the egg is something we've seen throughout history and seen throughout multiple sightings.

708
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Glowing eggs.

709
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Eggs.

710
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Another egg shaped object.

711
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Egg.

712
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
The egg.

713
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
The egg.

714
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
The cosmic egg.

715
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Egg.

716
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Eggs.

717
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Egg.

718
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Fellow alchemists, it's a new year and that means it's time to get organized and take control of our financial wellness.

719
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
For me, Rocket Money has been an absolute game changer.

720
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
It helped me uncover all sorts of subscriptions I totally forgot about.

721
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Like a few I had no idea I was paying for months after I stopped using the services.

722
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
With Rocket Money, I canceled these in just a few clicks, saving money instantly.

Go to rocketmoney.com slash Jesse today.

736
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
That's rocketmoney.com slash Jesse.

737
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Okay, so can you help me bridge the gap between this summoning that you're describing and you use the term we and then your crash retrieval endeavors?

738
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And I'm having trouble understanding how a helicopter pilot is also doing this other thing and what that correlation is.

739
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I mean, so within the 10 plus years since I first retrieved a craft in non-human origin where I was just serving as a dumb helicopter pilot, like, what the hell is going on?

740
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
A lot has happened since then.

741
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I mean, we've had the disclosure movement kick off.

742
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:05,000
But other recoveries that we could talk about were very emotional to me because there was a consciousness component to that.

743
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And I felt I felt that there was something conscious about the craft during the recovery process that had tapped into me and was disruptive in the most beautiful way.

744
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:28,000
My ability to operate a helicopter and almost led to me punching this craft off and creating a whole nother crash site like in between where I picked it up and dropped it off.

745
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
What what what is this instance?

746
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:42,000
This is the other one I can talk about called the eight gone, which is basically a disc, a flying disc with eight individual sections when viewed from above.

747
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And on this particular night, I got my normal readout for the load.

748
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And this time it included a hazmat disclosure for biologics.

749
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:02,000
So that typically meant, you know, souls on board is a disclosure I would get if there were living bodies, humans.

750
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Who's who's giving that readout as to whether there are guys on the ground and the guys that manifest and they don't say bad bodies.

751
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
They just say hazmat.

752
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Have you ever seen a body?

753
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
No, I've never seen an alien body.

754
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I've seen plenty of human bodies and recovered human bodies in this same way.

755
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
And it's a standard disclosure.

756
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So when I was flying in, I thought that's what I was dealing with is like, oh, shit, pilot crashed on the range and we're hauling off, you know, body parts here.

757
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Your colleagues have seen bodies, nonhuman intelligence body.

758
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
You'd have to ask them.

759
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
OK.

760
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And so in this case, you see this eight gone craft, this kind of octagon.

761
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
As I'm flying towards it, I get the readout on what it is.

762
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And I was trained as a pilot a long time ago.

763
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And the last 20 years, that's I've served more as a as a pilot than I have as a ground crew member or any other capacity.

764
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And the primary thing I've done is been a helicopter air operations expert.

765
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
So on most of these missions, I'm working from the cockpit of the helicopter.

766
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And so the ground crew is a separate crew that gets dispatched.

767
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And they're dealing with hazmat, security, containment, setting up a perimeter and an entry control point and observation like they're doing all that.

768
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I sit back at a separate location.

769
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I get GPS coordinates at the very last second.

770
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I get dispatched.

771
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I go there and then in route from very short range out, maybe five minutes out, I get read a description of what it is I'm picking up this night.

772
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I get an approximate size and dimension.

773
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
And then I get negative souls on board and a hazmat disclosure for biologics, for biological hazmat.

774
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
So I'm like, oh, great.

775
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Somebody crashed.

776
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Someone's dead.

777
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
All right.

778
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
So as I'm getting close to this craft, how big is the craft?

779
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Again, it's not that big, probably 25, 30 feet.

780
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
But it's like a like a disk.

781
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,000
This may be the size of this concrete slab here.

782
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Like this one's dark gray, like a dark matte gray or black, from what I could tell.

783
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I was getting very little light signature off of just the hard angles of the of the sections, but the eight sections like the intersection between the spine and then some of the texture that existed in those panels in between.

784
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:33,000
And still, like, there's nothing about this inherently that it's like that could be one of our crafts.

785
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Where is this, by the way?

786
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
California desert.

787
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
OK, similar location.

788
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Similar. Yeah, very similar.

789
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And but as I'm flying and I get closer to this craft, it's well, first of all, it's quiet.

790
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
When I say quiet, it was quiet on the radios at that time.

791
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
But my mind wasn't quiet.

792
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I start having this very emotional experience.

793
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
It's almost I haven't explained it this way before, but it's like when you feel like you're about to throw up, but you're not sure.

794
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
You're like, am I going to throw up?

795
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Oh, no, I'm good.

796
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
No, it's going to happen.

797
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Like it was like that, but not a nausea.

798
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It was like an emotional escalation that started inside of me that seemed completely foreign.

799
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
And the closer I got to the object, the more emotional I got.

800
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Sad or ominous or how would you describe it?

801
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,000
It was beautiful.

802
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
It was a beautiful feeling.

803
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
But it's so weird.

804
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,000
It's like that it's like that minor chord as a kid.

805
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It's like that sad beauty.

806
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
It's like a first, a minor third and a fifth.

807
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
It was beautiful, but there was a sadness to it.

808
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Did it communicate anything?

809
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I didn't get a message other than like I just felt like I was in the presence of my mother.

810
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
It was like a feminine energy that was loving and sad.

811
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:19,000
And I don't know what it was, but the closer I got, the more intense it got.

812
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I hooked up as I'm flying back to the drop site.

813
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I'm like completely overwhelmed.

814
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I'm like bawling my eyes out, flying a helicopter at night, like trying not to run into mountains and shit.

815
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
And I'm like, oh, my God, this is not good.

816
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
And I'm like, am I?

817
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And I didn't want to tell anyone about this because I'm like, then I'm not fit to fly.

818
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
And I'm like, am I stressed?

819
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Am I sleep with too much cortisol, estrogen pumped through my veins?

820
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
You know, what's going on?

821
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
And then as I get close, I make it there.

822
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I safely get it popped off.

823
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And then as I fly away, it goes away.

824
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I just want to paint the picture for people here because it's like you're flying a helicopter at night using night vision.

825
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
You have no idea.

826
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
You're like in pretty intense terrain.

827
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
You're carrying something that is like messing with your consciousness as you're doing one of the hardest.

828
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
You're flying one of the hardest objects ever made.

829
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Like have you had you ever been in a situation where you had something interfere with you on a conscious?

830
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Like it doesn't feel like I think that's what was most disturbing to me is being someone who prides themselves on like comfort and chaos.

831
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Like I've had every other thing try and fuck with me while I'm flying at night, like so much distraction, intensity and life or death situations.

832
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
And I'm cool with it.

833
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
But this messed me up, man.

834
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It messed me up.

835
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And there was a psionics team working that night.

836
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And so I don't know whether, you know, it's one of two things.

837
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Like either there was there was something with a very powerful talent inside of that thing that was connecting its soul or spirit to me as I was flying or one of the psionic assets got its consciousness trapped in that thing and somehow was communicating through me.

838
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And so what what are psionic assets?

839
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:48,000
When we look at collecting data, one of the areas that we look to collect data is through a psionic asset, which is an individual who's trained in remote viewing, psychic abilities, telekinesis, that type of thing, which is basically through a number of different protocols can transition into a place where they are highly sensitive to their environment.

840
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
From from the point of view of consciousness through a consciousness field.

841
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And that is not a woo woo topic.

842
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I'm just throwing it in.

843
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:03,000
But it's so matter of fact to me that it's the same as saying night vision goggles like it's there.

844
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:09,000
We use it and it's worked both on the it's used both on the summoning side and the data collection side.

845
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
So you're saying humans summon these humans.

846
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:19,000
There are two types of summoning that can be done that we've proven works and we're still working with.

847
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
There's machine based summoning systems and there's man based summoning systems.

848
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Machine based summoning systems are, without going into details, are signals and energy systems that can be turned on or activated that summon UAP activity or that UAP are attracted to.

849
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
And I say, again, remembering what UAP means, it's a very broad term.

850
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
It's unidentified anomalous phenomenon.

851
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
So unidentified anomalous shit shows up.

852
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
That's pretty broad category.

853
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Now, in order to be effective at serving as a P.A., you can think of consciousness as a field.

854
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Don't think of it as this superficial woo woo thing.

855
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Like it's literally like like the World Wide Web.

856
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
It's like the Internet.

857
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It's always there.

858
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
We can't see it.

859
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:20,000
It's full of information and exciting things, but point to it.

860
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I don't see it here.

861
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Right. So where is it?

862
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
You have to be able to tap into it.

863
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
You need something like a Wi-Fi signal to get there.

864
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:43,000
So individuals that have this gift are people that have been trained and have the talent to serve as a Wi-Fi to tap into the consciousness field where everything in the universe seems to exist or have its presence.

865
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And once you can do that, now you're in an environment where while we're having other multiple forms of sensitive data in place, if a UAP shows up, is it registering in the consciousness field that our P.A.

866
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:03,000
asset is connected to through the Wi-Fi and the Wi-Fi is this process of getting into mindful meditation.

867
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:18,000
So two things are happening in that process or protocol of serving as a P.A., lowering intellect, increasing intuition, and then reintroducing intellect at a higher level as an observer, not as a driver.

868
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
How do you do that?

869
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Well, you're either born with a gift or you go through you spend 30 years as a Shaolin monk and you figure out how to do it the hard way.

870
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
There are easier ways.

871
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:39,000
There are cheats and some of the cheats that have been experimented with are things that have not fared well for those involved in the program, including children.

872
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
And I'll talk about them.

873
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
So how do we how do we heighten intuition?

874
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Well, you do it through stress inoculation.

875
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:54,000
You do it through triggering flight or fight or flight biology systems in our body.

876
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Some of the most powerful things you can do is trigger that on.

877
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Like if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

878
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Don't reinvent the wheel.

879
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,000
The human mind and body is already something so spectacular we don't understand it.

880
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I don't know why it works.

881
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:11,000
But if you can trigger flight or fight, all these things get activated and intuition does.

882
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
So stress inoculation is one.

883
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
You've got to hijack the amygdala and boom, you put someone there.

884
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
You need to do that to heighten intuition while subduing intellect.

885
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
How do you do that?

886
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
You subdue the intellect by disassociation.

887
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,000
So there are chemical ways to induce disassociation.

888
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:39,000
There are more proactive ways that you could do yourself like through meditation.

889
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
But all in all, those are the two things you do to get into that state.

890
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Well, kids are naturally way more visceral in both of those things.

891
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
They're naturally more intuitive.

892
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Their intellect is lower.

893
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,000
There is one more thing that you have to do to even enter that and that deals with the other eye instinct.

894
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
So your instincts have to be satisfied at this time.

895
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
So that just means you have to be comfortable.

896
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Can't be hungry.

897
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Can't be horny.

898
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Can't be tired.

899
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Can't be worried about your survival.

900
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
You can't be cold.

901
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
You can't be hot.

902
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
So all that has to be taken care of.

903
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:17,000
So the limbic part of your brain is not like freaking out while the prefrontal cortex,

904
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:24,000
whatever part of the brain it is that's more responsible for the hardware that helps you connect to the consciousness internet is.

905
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So satisfy the instinct.

906
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Heighten the intellect or suppress the intellect.

907
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Heighten the intuition.

908
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Add back in the intellect at a high level.

909
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Boom, you're in it.

910
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Now, there's another way that we do, and that's through hardware.

911
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:50,000
So you could do software, chemical drugs to in order to get a stress inoculation, the disassociation, or you can do hardware.

912
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:09,000
One of the guys on our team has made a breakthrough recently and uses a system which is basically a non intrusive ultrasound system that can target the brain and induce or at least take a lot of information.

913
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
You can take the edge and the struggle out of transitioning into that state.

914
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:30,000
And so he's he's one of the guys that works in our new organization that is assisting us with reproducing and demonstrating all of this stuff that has gone on over the decades in the program that comes with all this baggage and secrecy and stuff.

915
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:46,000
And we're trying to leave all that behind and do it now in this in this clean and free environment where we have autonomy as a private organization working in partnership with government organizations and educational institutions to put this out there once and for all.

916
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
And, you know, in that effort, we feel this is a much more humane way.

917
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
And everyone that works with us is doing so on a volunteer basis.

918
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:05,000
But how the ultrasound works is it can target it can get through the skull and it can target parts of the brain to help you transition out of intellect and into your intuition.

919
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:16,000
And the most of the experimentation that is done in the testing that is done in order to find the people that can serve in this role is done through a random number generator.

920
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:27,000
So he runs or runs a random number generator program and then has the subject sit there and and hopefully I'm not butchering this whole process of how he tests it.

921
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:35,000
But has the subject then has the ultrasound equipment run into the brain.

922
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:41,000
The consciousness is activated through lowering intuition, heightening intuition and lowering intellect.

923
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:49,000
And now the individual can impose its will on this random number generator that's running in a computer and can cause the number to move up if he wants or causes it to move down.

924
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:57,000
And context for the audience, a random number generator is basically a graphical interface that shows ones and zeros.

925
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,000
It's a binary computer and it's tied to something that is conventionally thought of as random and quantum mechanics.

926
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
So radioactive isotope decay and photon bouncing around a little box.

927
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And so it's a perfect digital coin flip over a long enough time scale.

928
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,000
You should expect the same amount of ones and zeros with maybe a small standard deviation.

929
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And if you're saying that through stress inoculation and dissociation or through this hardware technique,

930
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:29,000
somebody can in a statistically significant way affect that it's called a Z score in this random event generator.

931
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
So you get more ones or more zeros.

932
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:41,000
You're basically saying that that person has more ability to render their reality and affect that more of a mind over matter effect through consciousness.

933
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
They can affect reality, which is nuts.

934
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Here's the crazy thing. Even if they in that test because zero or flat line or the middle line is the reality.

935
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Right. So even if someone could get it to deviate the most minuscule number, any deviation is infinitely mind blowing because because it's that good of a test because there should be no deviation.

936
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
So any deviation should be good.

937
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:19,000
And what happens is crazy because as it starts, once the subject looks over realizes they're being successful, they're like, oh, shit, I'm moving the thing.

938
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Then it's a blur and it drops back down and they got to go back into it.

939
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,000
And then you'll see the spike, the trend, the vector of the trend over the report moves up and down.

940
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And when they kind of come out of it and realize they're moving it, it goes back down.

941
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,000
And then it almost becomes exponential. They just they blast it out of proportion.

942
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:47,000
A close friend and mentor of mine used to specialize in this experiment at Princeton, their Paris psychology lab, the pair lab, where they studied all sorts of anomalous stuff.

943
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
And he would call this the rebound effect.

944
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And you can analogize it with, you know, you're playing basketball and you're making a bunch of shots or whatever.

945
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And then all of a sudden you become, you know, conscious of it.

946
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
And then you have this snapback effect.

947
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:05,000
In life, generally, people have these sort of upward momentum streaks and then they come, you know, crashing down.

948
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And there's always this sort of local mean reversion.

949
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And so it's wild to see that actually exemplified in the form of an experiment.

950
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:19,000
So as fun as that is, and we could sit here and talk about that all day and just take people off, like there's a real practical application for that.

951
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
So I'm just saying that to say, like, this is a real thing.

952
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:29,000
What we do, you put someone in out there that's trained to do that and you support them with the right support system and environment.

953
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And then you're also out there with the right data collection equipment.

954
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:41,000
So not only monitor their experience to make sure they're safe and healthy and not getting hurt, but you're also correlating it to your other measure.

955
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
It's a measuring device for us.

956
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,000
That's what this whole crazy thing about taking a psionic asset, putting them in our work suite,

957
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:56,000
which is like a Faraday cage and getting them involved is just to add a sixth, seventh, eighth piece of equipment.

958
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:06,000
So when this phenomenon shows up, does the random number generator in here move when it also shows up on IR over our radar?

959
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
So it's not like we're going off the deep end.

960
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Our whole world is all about psionics and remote viewing.

961
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It's not literally correlating with an observable.

962
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,000
You're getting on another and multisensory corroboration is what you're looking for in a scientific process.

963
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And it works the other way.

964
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Sometimes the intent is to have the psionic assets summon the phenomenon and the rest of the equipment is turned down.

965
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And then because we want to be able to isolate where we're having successes.

966
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
So they they ramp up, they activate, they summon, they invite it in.

967
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And then the rest of the equipment becomes measuring for their for their summoning effort.

968
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
And so, yeah, so it sounds like the U.S.

969
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
government has used kids as psionic assets.

970
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
And does that bother you at all?

971
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Yeah, that bothers me. Yeah, yeah, it does.

972
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
It does bother me.

973
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Do you have a model of what these crafts are and what's inside of them?

974
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Well, interestingly enough, this particular craft, the eight gone is exactly what Michael Herrera reports to have seen.

975
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
That's the one.

976
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
So one time I've ever heard this brought up that account.

977
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And it's it's a it's it's Matt Black, like you described.

978
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
He calls it Phantom Black.

979
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And he says it has eight, you know, like an octagonal shape.

980
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Yeah. So I heard Michael Herrera's story in Washington, D.C.

981
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:41,000
There was in twenty twenty three, I believe there was a whistleblower conference shortly after the whistleblower protection act got activated.

982
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And then there was this at the National Press Club hosted by Stephen Greer.

983
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:57,000
There were several whistleblowers that had decided to come forward in that environment and share their stories.

984
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:13,000
So we were actually sent there on behalf of our employer to look for whistleblowers that we were trying to basically report to the FBI and get arrested.

985
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Because at that time, I was in this weird place between becoming a whistleblower or rounding up the whistleblowers and shutting them up.

986
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Because there are good reasons and bad reasons to be a whistleblower.

987
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
And so so you are at this press event, red teaming, basically.

988
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Exactly. You are trying to maybe gather intel on people who might become a liability for the program.

989
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
And you hear Michael Herrera give his testimony.

990
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I was prepared for that. So it's I'm sorry, because you had already seen the eight gun.

991
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Yes. And then he talked to us what you had experienced firsthand.

992
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
And then he's getting up there and everyone's like, this guy's full of shit.

993
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Well, he was his was the craziest testimony from that.

994
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And so basically, this guy is saying in 2009, he's deployed with his marine unit to the Philippines.

995
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Then a small part of that marine unit, like eight or nine people get actually moved off to Indonesia.

996
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Is this right? Yes. And there's a seven Richter scale earthquake that just occurred in the area.

997
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
So it's a disaster zone. This is good. We're going to want to go over this whole thing.

998
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Keep going. And he sees this eight gun octagon shaped craft, matte black.

999
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,000
He describes it as like blacker than black. And it's hovering above the treetops.

1000
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
And his unit starts to close in because what what is this thing?

1001
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
And there's a there's a there's a humming sound around it. So not a traditional engine.

1002
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Yeah. And as they're sort of moving towards it, what he describes as this elite,

1003
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:54,000
possibly Department of Energy paramilitary unit with technical gear out the wazoo comes and apprehends he and his team.

1004
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
And they have bioscanners and they have all sorts of technical gear.

1005
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,000
They're threatening this team of Marines and they're saying it's easy to get lost in the jungle. Right. Yeah.

1006
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,000
They were actually two of the guys were actually talking about either.

1007
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Hey, should we smoke these guys right now? You know, that's what they kept saying.

1008
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
It was kind of feeding more into the fear at that point, because again, I don't know who these guys are.

1009
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I know they had American gear. They had American sidearms as well.

1010
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,000
If these guys have actually taken off like we have and then why they're going against people like us

1011
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:30,000
and even willing to kill servicemen who just even stumbled onto this is just blows my mind and it's very sick.

1012
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And so Michael Herrera comes back to the U.S. He's shocked.

1013
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:41,000
He actually does a little bit of press around this because he's like, this is ridiculous that this is being hid to the American public.

1014
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:51,000
And then somebody back channels to him from the program and says, actually, the reason that that elite squad was there

1015
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:59,000
and they were there next to that craft is because they were transferring psionic assets for the program.

1016
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:05,000
And so this was a human trafficking operation where they were taking people, putting them in pods,

1017
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,000
loading them onto these craft, and then that craft was taking them back to the U.S. for use.

1018
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
We backchanneled it. That was us. We backchanneled that.

1019
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
That was you. That was me. Oh, my God.

1020
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:23,000
So when that happened, we were able to cooperate at least three key things.

1021
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:30,000
One, that those type of paramilitary units do exist because guys from our group get recruited

1022
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:37,000
and offer jobs to go to all to go exercise our skills elsewhere outside the U.S.

1023
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I have never done it. I've never been part of those teams.

1024
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:46,000
The other thing is the description of the craft is exactly what I had seen before and my team had seen before,

1025
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:52,000
except he claimed this one was like 300 feet in diameter, never seen one that big.

1026
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
The other thing were the containers.

1027
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,000
He described the containers at the time as being used for transporting drugs.

1028
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
He was just making speculating. He wasn't lying.

1029
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:10,000
But he assumed that they were there must be transporting drugs because he saw these units on the roofs.

1030
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Well, those units were so those units that they used are consistent with the workstations we use when we're out on the range.

1031
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:23,000
There are many split HVAC systems that are used up there because, as I explained,

1032
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
that's where we have our data observation team in those.

1033
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
And most of the time, those are the Faraday cages for the psionic assets.

1034
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:38,000
We also know that that there are operations Oconus outside the continental United States

1035
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:43,000
where prospecting for psionic assets takes place and they're highly coveted.

1036
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And the interesting thing is, is I hear in those programs that there's something valuable about the life experience in third world countries

1037
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,000
in that it seems as though people that live a simpler life and are outdoors more

1038
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:08,000
and have less contaminants in their food and their drugs and in their culture seem to be a little bit better at disassociating and heightening their intuition.

1039
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,000
And they come willingly because of the economic imbalance between where they come from.

1040
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:21,000
So what I really don't like about how that came out and when Sean Ryan was there at the time with us in D.C.

1041
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:28,000
when this happened and we talked about this shortly after that is when Herrera went on his show.

1042
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:36,000
And the thing took a kind of a dark turn because the term human trafficking was slapped on this thing.

1043
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,000
And when you hear that, you think of slavery and sex trafficking and all these things.

1044
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
And as my understanding, that's not at all what goes on in these operations.

1045
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
It's no different than someone setting up any other type of business.

1046
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
And the people come willingly, the people that work in these programs, it's a great job.

1047
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
It's fun.

1048
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Some of them have known their whole life that they have this intuition or this special talent

1049
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:06,000
and they're socially awkward or have other pathologies, social pathologies that they're dealing with too

1050
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
that somehow seems like it plays into this.

1051
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:14,000
So it's like not all the people that are talented in this way are normal in every other way.

1052
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
It's like God created some balance.

1053
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,000
So when they can come in and get involved in this program and have food and shelter and be treated with respect

1054
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:29,000
and make money, like if you went down there on your high horse representing the United States and morality

1055
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
and went in and tried to liberate these people, they'd be like, get out of here.

1056
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
We don't want to be liberated.

1057
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
This is our job.

1058
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Can I play devil's advocate for one second?

1059
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I think in the Michael Herrera testimony, he thought that whatever organization this paramilitary group was from

1060
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
was taking advantage of the fact that Indonesia was this disaster zone.

1061
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Right.

1062
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
And some of these people can go missing easily.

1063
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Yes.

1064
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
And so that to me sounds a little more-

1065
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
That's one theory.

1066
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Or the hurricane, the natural disaster was actually threatening a workspace for this operation

1067
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
and they needed to get the hell out of Dodge.

1068
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Got it.

1069
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I have no firsthand experience with that operation nor direct contact with anyone involved with it.

1070
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I know of that type of operation.

1071
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I know of that craft.

1072
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I know of those containers and I know of operations that that sounded like.

1073
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
And so the whole point of all this, and let me put a big giant red bow on it for you,

1074
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
is that this was one I liked.

1075
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I saw a good Marine up there when I saw Mike.

1076
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I saw a brother in arms doing his best to be put now with a microphone in his face

1077
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
in a fucking suit and tie in Washington, D.C.

1078
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:53,000
when he's cut out to be carrying a saw through the jungle.

1079
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
And now he's doing his best and he's an honest, good guy.

1080
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And I was going to let him hang.

1081
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:03,000
So I sidebarred Greer and a bunch of other people and said we need to talk about this.

1082
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I thanked Michael.

1083
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:13,000
And I have been loyal to him throughout the process and trying to help him as much as I can get support for this

1084
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:21,000
while also trying to stay low key to figure out where the problems in landmines are with this issue.

1085
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:28,000
And this issue was brought up to the the entire incident was brought up with my cooperations

1086
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,000
and my additional information was presented to Sean Kilpatrick's version of Arrow.

1087
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:39,000
He patently denied it and wrote it off as anti interesting.

1088
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
And there was no evidence.

1089
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:47,000
And I know for a fact that Sean Kilpatrick has admitted outside of the Office of Arrow

1090
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,000
directly to members of the Senate Intelligence Committee that it did in fact happen

1091
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,000
exactly as reported by Michael Herrera and with my additions.

1092
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
That's absolutely wild.

1093
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:04,000
The implication of this story is that we can fly these objects

1094
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:10,000
because we were transporting these psionic assets in this octagonal shaped craft.

1095
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
So I would think and again I'm stepping way outside my bounds.

1096
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I have no idea how and who that operates.

1097
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:25,000
But something like a reversed engineered version of the craft is probably what you were saying.

1098
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
So this brings up maybe the most fundamental question,

1099
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
which is why has the U.S. government, prime aerospace contractors, international organizations,

1100
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:39,000
according to you, why have they been systematically using these psionic assets,

1101
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:45,000
using other kind of machinery based attraction techniques to attract these UFOs?

1102
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
What are they doing with the UFOs that land?

1103
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Like what do you think was done with the egg that you retrieved, for example?

1104
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
First of all, I don't know.

1105
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:04,000
But I am taken somewhere to a secure facility and it was either destroyed or hidden or buried

1106
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
because they have so many of them now that it's not interesting to them.

1107
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Or that it was researched with the utmost secrecy.

1108
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:22,000
The senior EG&G engineer described to my great uncle that it was egg shaped, about the size of a SUV.

1109
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:27,000
They tried to penetrate the hull, try to open it. They couldn't.

1110
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:32,000
They said that they were able to take some very small samples of the material.

1111
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:37,000
I'm not an expert in chemistry, but I guess the isotope ratio or the mixture of elements,

1112
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
they concluded it was not made on Earth.

1113
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:46,000
So it sounds like we have, by your account, and again this is fully speculation,

1114
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I realize you don't know this, but like thousands of UFOs?

1115
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I think the problem is saying we. That's a big problem.

1116
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Because who's we? We don't have shit.

1117
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Most of this stuff is kept in very niche private aerospace.

1118
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
And this is why the government doesn't quite have a handle on it.

1119
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:07,000
This stuff, another reason I can say this is because I know how our operations work.

1120
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Nobody knows what I do on a daily basis.

1121
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Even my middle leader, I could go out on the range and have a particular day,

1122
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
or have an interaction, or have something happen.

1123
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Nobody in Washington DC knows what the hell I did that day.

1124
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
It doesn't matter how profound it is.

1125
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Why is there not a clear chain of command? Why is there not some sort of central authority?

1126
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,000
You have rumors of a buddy of mine, Walter Kern.

1127
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I introduced him to David Grush, he's a journalist.

1128
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:45,000
He came out saying, Grush told him that Cheney was the gatekeeper for all legacy UFO programs.

1129
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
You have these people who do seem to be at the top.

1130
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
You hear rumors of Kissinger back in the day.

1131
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
That's part of our ignorance is the assumption that there's some functional structure in place.

1132
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
There's not. There's not.

1133
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Why isn't there?

1134
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Well, because private aerospace holds a lot of the power and the real estate in this space.

1135
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
The US government, they kind of lost control of it a long time ago.

1136
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
That's my sense is that in the 50s when the Atomic Energy Commission was set up,

1137
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,000
where all this stuff was going down around Los Alamos and other sensitive nuclear sites,

1138
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:27,000
you had basically the overlaying of nuclear secrecy on top of UFO secrecy.

1139
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
If you look at the special definition of nuclear material,

1140
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
basically anything emitting alpha, beta, gamma radiation,

1141
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:39,000
any sort of material with radiological properties are born secret upon retrieval.

1142
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
If you're the US government and you retrieve this stuff officially,

1143
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
you're in big trouble because you don't have plausible deniability.

1144
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,000
You kind of committed this crime. This is open source science.

1145
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
But if you get a prime aerospace contractor to do it, you're much safer and you're more insulated.

1146
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
And you have this whole Cold War secrecy era.

1147
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:03,000
And I think what we have now is kind of a cargo cult of that Cold War secrecy.

1148
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,000
It's this structural overhang that is completely anachronistic

1149
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
and actually makes no sense from an American national defense or security standpoint.

1150
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
And it's not like they train. I wasn't even told that.

1151
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Nobody told me that's the structure I'm working under.

1152
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I had to find out the hard way.

1153
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,000
When the New York Times article came out, like 2017,

1154
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,000
it was really about then things started getting really weird for us.

1155
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And there was a lot of movement in our world.

1156
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
A lot of things changed for us.

1157
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,000
A lot of our contract callouts changed.

1158
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
New people are introduced into leadership structures.

1159
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Our communication method changed.

1160
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Our compensation package got creative.

1161
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:57,000
And just knowing the way this world works is because it's so heavily compartmentalized

1162
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
and because we operate as a hidden hand,

1163
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:06,000
that's one of the primary benefits of the service we provide,

1164
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
that the plausible deniability button

1165
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:16,000
that people at the top can hit in order to protect themselves

1166
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
would sever us as the hidden hand.

1167
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,000
And that's kind of an ugly truth we always knew was there,

1168
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,000
but we were willing to put ourselves in that position because we're patriots

1169
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:31,000
and we always believed that it was for the better of our nation

1170
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
and to strengthen our country.

1171
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
At this time, that came into question

1172
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
because there was so much happening and it was obvious.

1173
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
And we knew people started peering over the cubicles, you could say,

1174
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
of compartmentalization.

1175
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
We started sharing facts.

1176
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
We started putting together the best we could,

1177
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
the broader picture of what's going on here

1178
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
because everyone had a little piece of the puzzle.

1179
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
And the guy you're talking to today sitting here,

1180
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
and the reason I can talk broadly about this,

1181
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
is because my view and understanding of this has, like,

1182
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
doubled, quadrupled, if not more, just in the last five years

1183
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
than it had in the previous 20

1184
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,000
because of all the team building and correlation

1185
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
and the networking going on with trusted individuals,

1186
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
like some of our mutual friends,

1187
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
to try and figure out what the hell is going on,

1188
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:27,000
not only to answer the questions of to what extent does our country

1189
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
have advanced technology, how much of it is non-human,

1190
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
but to what extent has our government become compromised

1191
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
and how much are we at risk?

1192
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Where are the good guys? Where are the bad guys?

1193
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
We're kind of screwed because we're trapped on the dark side of this thing.

1194
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:46,000
The military-industrial complex or the deep black state

1195
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,000
is not this evil empire full of Darth Vader.

1196
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
It's the best and brightest.

1197
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
It's the most patriotic. It's the most talented.

1198
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
It's the most committed, accomplished people working over here.

1199
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And 99% of what goes on, this nation benefits from

1200
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
and is what makes the nation great and powerful

1201
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
is because of the fruits these institutions

1202
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
and private companies and the people that work there provide.

1203
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
So, like, that's really scary to get like,

1204
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
oh, you know, I'm like, oh, my God, are we one of the bad guys?

1205
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,000
So we're trying to figure out which side of this issue to be on.

1206
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
And one of the things I feel extremely fortunate about

1207
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,000
in this moment right now is that

1208
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
the majority of the good guys have moved to this side.

1209
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I mean, thanks to people like David Grouch,

1210
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:42,000
who stuck his neck out and blazed the initial trail for disclosure

1211
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
and took a lot of crap for doing so,

1212
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
and I'm sure he thinks made a lot of mistakes

1213
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
and could have done things better,

1214
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
but he's made it much easier in a much better environment

1215
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
for us to come forward.

1216
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,000
It's much more obvious that the bad guys are weaning in number

1217
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
and they're doomed, and our numbers are growing.

1218
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:06,000
But at the time when I was at the conference in D.C.,

1219
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
that wasn't the case. We were teetering.

1220
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,000
And, you know, you're faced with that ultimate question of, like,

1221
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
do you do the right thing or do you self-preserve?

1222
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
And as a married man with kids,

1223
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,000
that self-preservation option becomes much more complex

1224
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
because it's about, like, my wife and kids and my livelihood

1225
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
and my quality of life and my wealth and net worth

1226
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
and everything we've worked on is at stake.

1227
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
And so it's a very complemented question,

1228
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,000
but it didn't take me long to decide because, like,

1229
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I had to believe that in the end of the day that my intuition

1230
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,000
and my instincts for patriotism and for good

1231
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
would lead me at every moment to the proper conclusion.

1232
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,000
And this really began when we sat there in the audience,

1233
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
me and my teammate, and we're listening to Michael Herr's story,

1234
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:05,000
and I was able to understand what he was saying was true

1235
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
or at least had elements that I was fully aware of

1236
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
that he didn't quite understand that he couldn't have been making up

1237
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:17,000
because if he did, somebody planted ideas in his imagination

1238
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
because he nailed exactly what goes on.

1239
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:27,000
So it was at this moment that we began to help out.

1240
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
And what does that look like?

1241
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
So the second you decide internally,

1242
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I'm going to choose the hard path.

1243
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
This program needs to be reformed.

1244
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
This Michael Herrera guy is actually a good guy.

1245
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Do you go back to headquarters and you say,

1246
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
you go to your boss and you say,

1247
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
hey, actually you were wrong to have me red team this guy?

1248
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Or what exactly happens there?

1249
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Do you kind of move in the dark?

1250
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:53,000
No, we went back and we flipped on red team power

1251
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
in the ultimate fashion.

1252
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:01,000
And we began to black team the black team is what we did.

1253
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:07,000
So and it was fun to have that clear of an orientation

1254
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
and to be that fucking fired up about it because we went after them.

1255
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:16,000
And so the first question is who the hell are we working for

1256
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
and what are their intentions?

1257
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
This was happening at a time we were set out to recover

1258
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:26,000
some sensitive information that was believed to be kept on some tough books,

1259
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Panasonic tough books.

1260
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
This was in the last four years.

1261
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,000
And it's believed on these topics was highly sensitive information

1262
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:41,000
that was evidence to see our programs that we were involved in.

1263
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:49,000
We received human intelligence that gave us the Intel package

1264
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
we needed to pursue where we thought the first set of tough books might be.

1265
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
A recovery team was sent and we found the tough books.

1266
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I'm not going to say where and we returned them to our employer

1267
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
at a familiar facility in the California desert.

1268
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
The tough books were missing the hard drives.

1269
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,000
We then set out to recover the hard drives.

1270
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:17,000
We found the human argument asset led us to another location high in the Sierra's,

1271
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
which was a glacier lake.

1272
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,000
And the hard drives were sealed in a steel container like 25 feet under water.

1273
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
What?

1274
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
So a third mission...

1275
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
What exactly is on these hard drives?

1276
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I don't know.

1277
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Whatever it was, there was at least two adversarial parties

1278
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
who would do anything to get their hands on them.

1279
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
And we got caught in the middle.

1280
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
The next mission we went out on, I'll just tell you that shots were fired

1281
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
and we called bullshit.

1282
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:55,000
And that's when we began to backtrack and set out with our own effort

1283
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
to find out exactly who we were working for and what they were interested in.

1284
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Can you say who you were working for?

1285
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
No, I can't say.

1286
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:07,000
There's currently two investigations taking place right now.

1287
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
FBI?

1288
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
FBI is one of them.

1289
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,000
And when you say you called bullshit, shots were fired,

1290
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
can you say anything about that incident specifically?

1291
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
No.

1292
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Fair enough.

1293
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I was wondering the same thing.

1294
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
We got jerked around.

1295
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Our intel changed, last minute, our location changed.

1296
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,000
There was a lot of bad things that were going on rhythmically that didn't smell right.

1297
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
But we kept putting one foot in front of the other.

1298
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
And you almost have to at that point, whether you're playing along or not,

1299
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:43,000
because you need to play along to gather and to do interrogation

1300
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
of what traps are being laid in front of you.

1301
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
I just hope you don't fall on them because that's helpful information.

1302
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:55,000
When you say they are using you for plausible deniability just to sever the hidden hand,

1303
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
can you say anything more about that?

1304
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Yeah.

1305
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:06,000
It was believed that there was evidence of crash retrievals

1306
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:15,000
that were proof of criminal activity on these tough books.

1307
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:25,000
And that this data was captured illegally on operations within the program in the desert.

1308
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
And that there was a whistleblower or group of whistleblowers

1309
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:35,000
that were going to be turning this evidence in to the powers that be

1310
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:44,000
in order to expose the program and thereby doing that, expose individuals.

1311
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:49,000
So everyone likes to ask, why are you talking right now?

1312
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Aren't you afraid for your life?

1313
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
How come people haven't been killed?

1314
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
And I'll tell you why. There's a couple of reasons.

1315
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,000
One, why am I not afraid that someone's going to try and silence me with death?

1316
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Well, first of all, if they wanted to and were capable of doing it,

1317
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
if they had the will and skill to do it, they would have done it already.

1318
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Like Lou wouldn't be here, Dave wouldn't be here, I wouldn't be here.

1319
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
They wouldn't be here. They would have done it already.

1320
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I pray that you are right.

1321
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Just to play devil's advocate for a second, Lou and Dave are of different class than you.

1322
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,000
You've touched the metal, so to speak.

1323
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Maybe not the craft itself, but you are as close as it gets to the actual retrieval program.

1324
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
But why would that make me any more of a target?

1325
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Well, there's always the ability to stigmatize somebody.

1326
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I know Dave and I find him beyond reproach, but there's always the ability to hang on,

1327
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
this guy's just this intel guy, he's gathered a bunch of secondhand information,

1328
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,000
and it's what people use to detract from his testimony right now.

1329
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
With you, I think it's kind of hard.

1330
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:04,000
If you were to just listen to everything you've said today, it's tough to deny.

1331
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Well, that comes down to the will.

1332
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,000
So I say it's two things that keep you alive or kill you,

1333
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
is there has to be intent and capability, I call it will and skill.

1334
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:17,000
So there has to be a will to take me out, there has to be the skill, the ability to do it.

1335
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
So the will is going to come from this place.

1336
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:26,000
It's not going to come from what everyone thinks is a national security issue.

1337
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
We need to hide this stuff.

1338
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Where that's going to come from is from individuals within the organization

1339
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,000
or who have been involved in any part of these activities

1340
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
or who have committed crimes and wants to cover their ass.

1341
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
They will do anything to protect themselves,

1342
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:48,000
which includes taking out other people, wetworks.

1343
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:55,000
And so that makes for a very narrow group of folks

1344
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:00,000
that might at least have the will to do that.

1345
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
And you can kind of smoke those people out.

1346
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Skill is the other one.

1347
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Like who's actually going to facilitate this and how will that be facilitated?

1348
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
There are some sneaky ways to do it.

1349
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:16,000
There are some more blatant, like brute force ways to do it.

1350
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
You don't want to show up at my house

1351
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
and think you're going to be successful with brute force

1352
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
because that's going to go south for you really quickly.

1353
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Or you don't want to approach me anywhere in public.

1354
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Like you're going to have to really do something creative

1355
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
because I'm not afraid of the boogeyman.

1356
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I am the boogeyman.

1357
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
So you better bring it.

1358
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,000
But that's a lot of talk when you have wife and kids.

1359
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:47,000
So I'm not here to bring that on.

1360
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:53,000
But there is not,

1361
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
it hasn't been shown that anyone has the will and skill to do it

1362
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:01,000
or they would have already for me.

1363
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,000
And I think there are more good guys out on this side than there are bad,

1364
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
even at the high level.

1365
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Now, that all being said, I do know for a fact that

1366
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:22,000
there are leadership within entities that I work for and with

1367
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
that have called for wetworks.

1368
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:31,000
And there are people that have died under very suspicious circumstances

1369
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
at the most convenient time for those who would want to have them silenced

1370
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,000
who were coming out and who were speaking out on our activities.

1371
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Anybody you know?

1372
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Yes.

1373
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Can you say anything more?

1374
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:48,000
No, because there's an investigation happening right now

1375
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
and they're looking into it.

1376
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
That's scary, man.

1377
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
It is very scary.

1378
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,000
So when we realized we were being compromised,

1379
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I sent everybody home and we began to do our own operation.

1380
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,000
And I wanted to know if this came from the very top.

1381
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Was the top of our organization either complicit

1382
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,000
in this attempt to sever the hidden hand, which is us,

1383
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
or were they compromised?

1384
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Because there's the only two options.

1385
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Do you feel now like you have the proper protection in place?

1386
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Because I think from an American national security standpoint,

1387
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
if you have these different fiefdoms where the left hand isn't talking to the right hand,

1388
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
you have over-compartmentalization,

1389
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,000
you have all this knowledge locked up in these disparate pockets,

1390
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
and you're competing with China and Russia,

1391
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
that it's actually maladaptive from a national security standpoint.

1392
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
So is somebody in authority saying,

1393
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
you know, I see this Jake guy,

1394
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
he's actually acting in the best interest of the country,

1395
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
let's protect him in order to come out?

1396
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Yes, and now that takes us to Congress,

1397
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,000
because when I went to the director of security

1398
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
and realized he didn't have my back,

1399
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I realized I couldn't trust my nebulous network anymore,

1400
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,000
and then I was at a loss,

1401
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:17,000
and I was left with the one like emergency button

1402
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
that I always thought I had, and I punched it.

1403
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
And that was to go to Congress,

1404
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
to go to the Senate Intelligence Committee,

1405
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
and go to the monitor for CIA,

1406
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
and spill my guts and go, help me, help me, help me,

1407
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:34,000
this is what's happened, like, help.

1408
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
That was probably one of the most discouraging experiences of my life,

1409
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:42,000
because within minutes of being there and asking for help,

1410
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,000
they were begging for my help.

1411
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Interesting.

1412
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Like they didn't understand what was going on,

1413
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
they had no handle on it?

1414
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,000
No, they were being bullied and being harassed at their homes

1415
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
and were scared for their life

1416
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
and wanted me to set up a personal protection detail

1417
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
to help protect them,

1418
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
and I was like, fine, fuck,

1419
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I guess this is where we're going with it.

1420
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Because the long-standing rumors are that this is run by the CIA,

1421
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:16,000
that in 52 you had public-facing UFO research in the form of Blue Book,

1422
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
this sort of public relations effort,

1423
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
cleave off from the more vital organization actually studying this stuff,

1424
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
and that was the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence

1425
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
in collaboration with Battelle Memorial Institute,

1426
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
the Atomic Energy Commission,

1427
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
and then even up until today,

1428
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Chris Sharpe writing a great article for the Liberation Times,

1429
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
he's talking about kind of the chain of command for the UFO program,

1430
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,000
and he cites Glenn Gaffney as the CIA's Director of Science and Technology

1431
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
as being kind of one of the primary gatekeepers of the legacy UFO program.

1432
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
So when you go to them and you say,

1433
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
all this crazy stuff is happening and it's super disorganized

1434
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
and it's kind of unethical,

1435
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
are they really just completely unaware?

1436
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
You mean Congress?

1437
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
No, I mean the CIA.

1438
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
CIA, so what's happening is there are multiple programs

1439
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
and multiple cover-ups happening all at the same time.

1440
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Everyone's, not everyone,

1441
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:14,000
but that's the biggest misunderstanding

1442
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:20,000
that everyone would benefit from resolving,

1443
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
is this is not that organized

1444
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,000
and it's not, there's not that much synergy at play.

1445
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:34,000
And why I know it's valuable that I'm here today is like,

1446
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,000
I'm like the fingertips,

1447
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,000
like I'm out here and we're touching it,

1448
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
we're the grassroots on the ground interacting with crash recovery,

1449
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
not reverse engineering, that's a different group.

1450
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,000
But all we've heard from is like say the shoulder joint,

1451
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
like the head of this thing,

1452
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,000
but the shoulder has no idea what's going on at the fingertips.

1453
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
And you could get to the elbow,

1454
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
and you could have some corruption and misdirection here

1455
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,000
that's like changing the direction and energy

1456
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
that's being sent down to the fingertips and vice versa.

1457
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
There isn't stuff going up and down.

1458
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
So it's this like gangly octopus of an organization.

1459
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
It's not this monolith.

1460
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
No, it's not.

1461
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
And just think about it,

1462
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
like we give it too much credit in that regard,

1463
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,000
like how in the world could you manage

1464
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
like hundreds of thousands of humans,

1465
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
first of all,

1466
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
with all their flaws and instincts who are trained as the number one,

1467
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
trained that the number one rule is deception.

1468
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
And so they're all being deceiving,

1469
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,000
and like this is supposed to be some big organization that works together.

1470
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
And then the detractors are going to say,

1471
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
why haven't there been more whistleblowers?

1472
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
And then I think that the answer is there have been.

1473
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
There have been.

1474
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Stephen Greer has a database of hundreds of whistleblowers.

1475
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Well, this is where I just want to say something.

1476
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I think for people who may be sitting in your position,

1477
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
because they're watching this, Jake, they're watching this,

1478
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,000
and they might be thinking about going through what you're going through.

1479
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Is there anything you'd say to them?

1480
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Yeah.

1481
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
You know, it's a problem and it's sad,

1482
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
but our Congress is not in control.

1483
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
They are completely.

1484
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,000
They're ignorant and neutered when it comes to the subject matter.

1485
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
For the most part, they're ignorant and neutered.

1486
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
And where they're not ignorant and neutered,

1487
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
they're corrupt and arrogant,

1488
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:35,000
which nets us a Congress that's in a state of paralysis by analysis.

1489
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:40,000
And I can't tell you like for me how sinking a feeling that was like,

1490
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,000
I go running and I,

1491
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I'm nervous because I'm going to blow the whistle.

1492
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
The first place I go is the Senate Intelligence Committee

1493
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
and the monitor for CIA.

1494
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
And I start telling my story.

1495
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
They don't question it for one second.

1496
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
They know it's happening.

1497
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,000
They're like, they're, they're, they're edifying everything I'm saying

1498
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:07,000
and trying to cut me off because they're so like,

1499
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
excited to actually get to talk about this.

1500
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
And they're like, oh my God, so what do I do?

1501
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
They're like, give me your number.

1502
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Do you have signal? I need to text you.

1503
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
These guys are at my house last night.

1504
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
And I'm like, wait a minute.

1505
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
This was my asking for help moment.

1506
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
My fellow citizens,

1507
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,000
today we celebrate the mystery of American renewal.

1508
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
I know that my experience,

1509
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
it's no coincidence that it happened during the Clinton era.

1510
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:38,000
And the path that I took was something that was heavily influenced by the fact

1511
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:43,000
that the Clintons were in office and that when Clinton took office,

1512
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,000
he was, I think, surprised to find out that he was

1513
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:54,000
never intended to be a part of the leadership structure.

1514
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:58,000
He was ostensibly in control of and knew that he was surrounded by lies

1515
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,000
and limited by laws and quickly took an interest in the subject.

1516
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,000
And when he couldn't get answers, started taking action.

1517
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:13,000
And I think our, whatever I ended up doing was, was related to that

1518
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:18,000
and was part of the pressure that was put on the DOD to maybe even create

1519
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,000
like a red team, to infiltrate the black team and get into the programs

1520
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:27,000
and then report back through our leadership structure as to what's really going on.

1521
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,000
A couple of interesting data points around that.

1522
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Hillary Clinton, there's a picture of her at U.S.A.

1523
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Hillary Clinton, there's a picture of her at Camp David.

1524
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
And I think she had met with Lawrence Rockefeller, who is really interested

1525
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
in UFO disclosure.

1526
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,000
And she's holding this book by this physicist, Paul Davies, and it's Are We Alone?

1527
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
And clearly she was getting into the topic of UFO disclosure.

1528
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:54,000
And then John Podesta, who is their chief of staff, has been a major,

1529
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:58,000
major proponent of disclosure for the last two decades.

1530
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Yeah. And if you look at the timing, I'll tell you it's probably no coincidence

1531
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,000
that when Hillary was running for president that there's a correlation

1532
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,000
in timing with the standing up of ATIP and what led to the New York Times

1533
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
article. And there are things there.

1534
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:21,000
I think the Clintons have always wanted to be involved with disclosure.

1535
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:27,000
And as much as everyone likes to vilify them, I don't think there's any real,

1536
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,000
probably isn't as much of like a self-serving reason other than like

1537
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
a general curiosity.

1538
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,000
I don't think it's a power grab to want to take it.

1539
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:41,000
It doesn't seem to be any real benefit to being a politician associated

1540
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
with the disclosure.

1541
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:50,000
But yeah, from just my experiences and people I've talked to that are in the

1542
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
know, I'm probably a little bit more than the average person.

1543
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:58,000
The Clintons have definitely been key individuals and have initiated some

1544
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
efforts that are pro-disclosure.

1545
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Trump is now promising a whole new era of disclosure.

1546
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Obviously, the proverbially famous example would be the JFK case.

1547
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Was that somewhat of an inside job?

1548
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Are there any details that we have that are classified that the public should

1549
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,000
know? I guess a couple of questions there.

1550
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Do you think UFOs get deprioritized because they're spending all of the

1551
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,000
political capital on these other disclosures?

1552
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Or are there kind of as rumored ball and chain dynamics where if you get JFK

1553
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:36,000
disclosure, you actually find out that his interest in UFOs might have

1554
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
something to do with his assassination?

1555
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Again, anyone could just do their homework.

1556
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
I think if you went out and you really looked at the information that's

1557
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:47,000
already been released and its credibility related to the JFK issue, there's

1558
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
clearly some ties.

1559
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:53,000
You look at the timeline of what was going on at the time.

1560
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:58,000
When you look at the evolution of this subject and how our government

1561
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:05,000
reacted to events of the 1940s and 50s and 60s, it makes a lot of sense.

1562
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:10,000
And it seems to be the best theory.

1563
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:16,000
And the fact that we might find out with Trump is exciting.

1564
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
But I sense hesitation even from him.

1565
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:25,000
If Cash Patel gets put as the director of FBI, it seems like he certainly was

1566
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:30,000
one read in on everything, but is motivated to share.

1567
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:35,000
And when I see him speaking cryptically about it recently on the clip we

1568
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,000
talked about.

1569
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
You're talking to a guy that's read the entire JFK file.

1570
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
The things that we can't release have nothing to do with the questions you

1571
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
guys are asking.

1572
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:48,000
The answers you guys want pretty much have them.

1573
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:55,000
There is very minimal stuff that can't be seen from things that you wouldn't

1574
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
even think are related to them.

1575
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,000
If you weren't connected to this subject matter, you might not pick up on it.

1576
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:07,000
But what I hear him saying cryptically is that the JFK assassination is linked

1577
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,000
to the UAP topic.

1578
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:12,000
And we have a lot of other corroborative data on that.

1579
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Maybe the most important piece of data is a guy named Harold Malmgren who was a

1580
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:24,000
presidential advisor for four different presidents, JFK, LBJ, Nixon, and Ford.

1581
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
And he says that there was this bluegill triple prime test in Johnston, Atoll,

1582
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:34,000
so in the South Pacific, Marshall Islands, and that you can even see in the deck

1583
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:40,000
logs from this test, bluegill triple prime, that this anomalous material fell out

1584
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
of the plume of this nuclear blast.

1585
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:49,000
That UFO material was taken to the Atomic Energy Commission's Albuquerque outfit.

1586
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:54,000
And Lawrence P. Geiss, who's actually Jeff Bezos' maternal grandfather, was actually

1587
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
the director at the time.

1588
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:01,000
And Harold Malmgren, who is on behalf of JFK, is taken to Los Alamos.

1589
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:07,000
And then JFK comes like a month later and gets woken up on the UFO issue.

1590
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:12,000
And then you have this letter of kind of controversial provenance, but we should

1591
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,000
really look into this and figure out if this is real, where he's writing to John

1592
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
McCone, who is the new CIA director.

1593
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
He had just fired Dulles.

1594
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:24,000
And he's saying, we actually need to coordinate with the Russians or the Soviets

1595
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:29,000
on UFOs because we want to make sure that they're not mistaking these UFOs for acts

1596
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:33,000
of American aggression because they're flying around sensitive airspace.

1597
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:40,000
So I think a lot of actually research lines up to make one believe that JFK did have

1598
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
maybe some interest there.

1599
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Yeah, I mean, all that makes sense.

1600
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:49,000
But when you try and tie it to motive to shoot him in the head in a public place,

1601
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
that's like, what?

1602
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Why would you go that far?

1603
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Well, I think it was probably not the primary reason.

1604
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
He was also trying to defang the nuclear arsenal.

1605
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
And you had guys like Dulles saying that it was an act of patriotism to take him out.

1606
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:05,000
OK, so you have all these disclosures vis-a-vis Trump.

1607
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Who should Trump empower?

1608
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
You know, there are talks of a UAP czar.

1609
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Should somebody be in charge here?

1610
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:17,000
First of all, I love the idea of Tulsi Gabbard as DNI.

1611
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Cash Patel is fantastic.

1612
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
It's really exciting.

1613
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I mean, people can say what they want about Trump, but the people he's surrounding himself

1614
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:29,000
with and what their intentions seem to be are really encouraging.

1615
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:35,000
And if you need a guy to clean house, like, dude, all he needs to do is he could just give Dave

1616
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:41,000
a hunting license to go after those who might have something to share.

1617
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
It would clear up a lot.

1618
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Like Dave.

1619
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Dave Grush.

1620
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Yeah.

1621
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Like, Dave's your guy.

1622
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
He knows what's going on.

1623
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,000
He knows where the bodies are buried.

1624
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
He knows where the bodies are buried.

1625
01:59:52,000 --> 02:00:00,000
And we do need some accountability, if not only to so that it doesn't repeat itself.

1626
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Like, I don't believe in vengeance, but I believe in justice.

1627
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
And that's the subtle difference.

1628
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:12,000
He and Carl Nell, who is just kind of gigabrain, next level, historical, philosophical thinker,

1629
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,000
and just also very high integrity guy.

1630
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Mr. Gresh, finally, do you believe that our government is in possession of UAPs?

1631
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Absolutely, based on interviewing over 40 witnesses over four years.

1632
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Are you one of David Gresh's 40 firsthand witnesses that he says he presented to the

1633
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,000
intelligence community inspector general Thomas Monheim?

1634
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:39,000
No, Dave and I met after his initial complaint was filed with the ICIG.

1635
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,000
And those guys represented a set.

1636
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I don't know the 40.

1637
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:48,000
I know of some of them.

1638
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:57,000
One of them is the guy who's no longer with us, whose demise was quite conveniently timed

1639
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
for those who might have something to do with it.

1640
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:04,000
But sorry, I didn't mean to go there with it.

1641
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,000
But no, that was a different group.

1642
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I'm part of a new group that met Dave in this process.

1643
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:17,000
I didn't know what Dave was doing at the same time we were doing it.

1644
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:22,000
We were going through the adopter process at about the same time when we were experiencing

1645
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,000
our whistleblower transition at the same time Dave was.

1646
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
It was weird.

1647
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
It was both happening at the same time, but completely different.

1648
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,000
You've got to remember, Dave is way up here at the shoulder, the high-end administrative

1649
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:40,000
end of the intel and the government's program.

1650
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,000
I'm down here on the fingertips trying to figure out what's going on.

1651
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:47,000
We ended up meeting in the middle in this effort.

1652
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
We should preface this for the audience.

1653
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,000
What is DOPSR?

1654
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:55,000
DOPSR is the Department of Defense review process.

1655
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:02,000
It stands for Department of Defense Pre-Publication and Security Review.

1656
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Because I held a clearance at one point and because I worked for the Department of Defense,

1657
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:19,000
anything I say publicly, whether it's written or any oral form written or spoken or videoed

1658
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:23,000
or recorded in any way, has to go through this process.

1659
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Then what it does allows the DOD and certain offices within DOD to review what I plan on

1660
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:38,000
sharing and strike it down if they think it risks operational security for any of them.

1661
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:43,000
The only specific knowledge I garnered when I was on the other side of the door,

1662
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:48,000
if I want to talk about that publicly, everybody who has had a job like I have has to submit

1663
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:53,000
to a thing called DOPSR at the Pentagon, DOD Pre-Publication and Security Review,

1664
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
even if it's about this stuff.

1665
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:00,000
How the hell did you get approval to speak to us today through DOPSR,

1666
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,000
through the DOD's pre-publication approvals?

1667
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,000
I mean, the stuff you're saying is pretty intense.

1668
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Yeah.

1669
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
And why are they letting you speak about it?

1670
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,000
This is a great question because this is going to help people understand

1671
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,000
pretty much why I answered the last question the way I did in previous answers,

1672
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:25,000
is that the DOPSR process is somewhat laughable from what its intent is.

1673
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:30,000
First of all, you have to understand that people like me have become so compartmentalized

1674
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
that we've become detached.

1675
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:37,000
There isn't even knowledge of some of the things that we have done

1676
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:48,000
that sit at a level of availability to people tasked with publication review

1677
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,000
at the Department of Defense that they could find and get their hands through and go,

1678
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
oh, yes, everyone again thinks of this in way too organized of a fashion.

1679
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
And maybe this is a good time, this will help you understand the DOPSR process

1680
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
because I'll tell you exactly how we manipulated it.

1681
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:08,000
When we decided to come forward and we, again,

1682
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,000
that was because we had some concerns about who we worked for and their intentions

1683
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:18,000
and whether or not we were in trouble and we're going to get severed is the hidden hand.

1684
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:24,000
We decided to query and run an interrogation of the Department of Defense

1685
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:32,000
and its private partners by writing a historical fiction novel.

1686
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:39,000
So I call it faction, a mixture of fact and fiction.

1687
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:45,000
We hired a ghostwriter and what we did is we put all of the claims that we wanted to,

1688
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:55,000
we wrote out 120,000 word manuscript and submitted it in pieces to the DOPSR process,

1689
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,000
starting with the first 20 pages, which is like 12,000 words.

1690
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:04,000
And our goal with this process was to essentially red team the DOPSR process

1691
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:10,000
to expose who subject matter experts are, they call them SMEs,

1692
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:20,000
and determine from those SMEs trying to lay out some form of map as to who's actually in control of this thing,

1693
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:26,000
who cares about what information and why, and then begin to either push harder

1694
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:33,000
and assume that when we hit walls and limitations that secret paths lie on the other edge of those directory

1695
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:38,000
and then we can begin to create little fact islands and try and draw a scaffolding between them.

1696
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:45,000
This was all done through our interrogation effort by creating a manuscript of a historical fiction, submitting it to DOPSR.

1697
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:53,000
In this process, the first 20 pages, we had four categories of information that we included.

1698
02:05:53,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Information A was classified, information we knew was classified, we knew was classified at a high level

1699
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:06,000
and that should get triggered and should get shot down, should get redacted.

1700
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Information B was information that was classified but was so need to know

1701
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:18,000
that it really only existed within the hearts and minds of the operators that were involved that day.

1702
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:24,000
It shouldn't be at an admin level for anyone to find or even once shopped out to subject matter experts,

1703
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:35,000
it was a very fine attack that would really precisely illustrate who is concerned with that type of information going public.

1704
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:41,000
The third type of information we included in that manuscript was open source classified information

1705
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,000
which might sound like an oxymoron but it's not.

1706
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:51,000
There is what is technically considered classified information out on the internet that somehow is leaked out

1707
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:56,000
but context matters, how and who is using it matters

1708
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:06,000
which kind of plays into why someone like Annie Jacobson or another author who has published incredible things on the subject matter

1709
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:10,000
is not subject to the DOPSR process at all.

1710
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:16,000
People like me who have held a clearance and have worked directly for the Department of Defense have to go through that process

1711
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:24,000
and so we used that as a basis, we used that as our leverage to force them to review it and redact it.

1712
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:30,000
And then there was the fourth type of information which was complete fictional liberty

1713
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:39,000
and what we did here is we speculated on the who, what, why and when of the broader picture outside what we knew

1714
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:45,000
through our own compartmented information and our need to know facts

1715
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:52,000
and then we draw what we thought were likely reasons and filled in around those facts and connected them to other

1716
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:58,000
and we went fishing to see if we could touch on something that was classified and get it redacted

1717
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,000
and then therefore point towards the SMEs.

1718
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:06,000
In doing this process we submitted, it took six months to get 20 pages back

1719
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:10,000
and we had seven pages of redactions from all four categories.

1720
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Wow.

1721
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:17,000
And we knew we were on, like game on, and so they were stuck.

1722
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
They can't have a poker face.

1723
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:26,000
So they're stuck in this situation where by not redacting something it passes through and now it's open source.

1724
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:33,000
By redacting something they are indirectly validating that it is sensitive and it is classified.

1725
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,000
It did really happen and someone's concerned about it.

1726
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:43,000
There is a counterplay though and that would be to intentionally allow something that was classified to get out

1727
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:53,000
under the context of a fictional novel and therefore internally sealing it with the stamp of the creative writings of a fictional author.

1728
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Boom, gone.

1729
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:04,000
And now something that's reality is now spun into fantasy and that's where it lives in the public domain.

1730
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:09,000
And that's a strategy that we use commonly.

1731
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:14,000
I call it, or I'll say the best place to hide the truth is in a pile of horse shit.

1732
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
And that's the best place to deal with it.

1733
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Or goes back to Plato where he writes the Republic and he says, everything I'm about to tell you is a lie.

1734
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:31,000
And then he writes this profound, beautiful musing on the ideal state but also with some metaphysical implications.

1735
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:37,000
And I think a lot of UFO history is hidden in plain sight vis-a-vis these fiction books.

1736
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:44,000
So you have Tom DeLong, Blink-182 frontman, writing with Peter Lavenda and A.J. Hartley,

1737
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:53,000
this whole series of I would say historical faction where he's dealing with executives at Lockheed Martin and other places

1738
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:56,000
and writing about crash retrievals and other things.

1739
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
You have another guy named Chase Brandon who's a CIA liaison to Hollywood.

1740
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:04,000
He wrote a great book called Cryptos Conundrum, which I believe has some real truth in it.

1741
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:08,000
And so this is an age old strategy.

1742
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,000
And it sounds like you read Team Dobser pretty effectively.

1743
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Yeah. Yeah, it worked.

1744
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
And they spit it out.

1745
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:23,000
And then what was funny is they didn't like, they're like, well, our purpose in only submitting 20 pages at the time

1746
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:32,000
is we want an opportunity to evaluate and react and then rewrite the subsequent chapters to probe for more redactions.

1747
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Or to probe for more willing, willing allowances of classified information.

1748
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:45,000
And they caught on to us and said, we're done.

1749
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
You have to submit your whole manuscript.

1750
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:51,000
And we were like, no, these were writing like a series.

1751
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:56,000
And it's like, consider this whole thing a series.

1752
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
And these are episodes.

1753
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:00,000
We are going to release only 20 pages at a time.

1754
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Do you want us to release it without it being reviewed?

1755
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Well, no, no, no.

1756
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
OK, well, then we need you to review it.

1757
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,000
And then we'll give you the next 20 pages because that's actually this isn't one book.

1758
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
We're going to release it four months later.

1759
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:17,000
So, you know, you're in the driver's seat in that regard because they kind of paint themselves into this corner with the way they work.

1760
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,000
And then you can use that against them, which is a Red Team 101 situation.

1761
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:29,000
And there's no distinction for them between fact and fiction where once it's passed Dobser, you can now say, actually, this was fact.

1762
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Because you passed it under the veneer of fiction.

1763
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
You can still now say this is fact.

1764
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
And it's in its context is king.

1765
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
So it's like what?

1766
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Because there are things that got redacted.

1767
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Like I said, that's open source.

1768
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:51,000
I cannot talk at length about organizations I worked for when I was enlisted, even though like I just told you everything about what I did and where I was stationed.

1769
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:54,000
And everybody knows the history of who's there and what's there.

1770
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
I can't I can't utter the words.

1771
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:05,000
I can't talk to you about my recruitment process at length and how I ended up where I did because that's that's redacted as well.

1772
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:17,000
But this is this is why it's confusing and why Dave can say we have multiple down craft and have collected dead pilots.

1773
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,000
And like, why could you say that?

1774
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:23,000
It's because when it goes in to Dobser, they distribute it.

1775
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:28,000
They do their they the people at the front read through and they do their best job to disseminate.

1776
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Oh, who should we ask about?

1777
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Who should care?

1778
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Another thing that happens is like no one else to touch that shit with a 10-foot pole.

1779
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:41,000
No no office wants to be the guy that says, oh, yeah, I have a problem with Dave saying biologics.

1780
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:46,000
It's like you want to pop your head up and like be the SME that has a problem with biologics.

1781
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Also, people that may have had a problem with it.

1782
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:54,000
This has to do with turnover and generations existing within these ancient organizations.

1783
02:12:54,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Like the fact that this has been going on for 70 years, like the people who had whose heads need to roll may not even be alive anymore.

1784
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
And someone else has taken that position.

1785
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:08,000
So this kind of gives them an easy way out.

1786
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:13,000
They're not having to come clean and confess the sins of their forefathers.

1787
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:20,000
All they have to do is allow classified information to not be redacted through the adopter process.

1788
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
And they just got disclosure.

1789
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:29,000
So from this angle, I think disclosure is almost on us to realize, aha, there's giving us a sign.

1790
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Departments and you can't think of the DOD of the adopter process.

1791
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Again, is this you people over credit the organizational and the synergy of these institutions.

1792
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
The three letter agencies don't mean shit.

1793
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Like this may be the way the government's only way to disclose is to like, I can't say it, but you can ask me question.

1794
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Ask me a yes or no question.

1795
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Ask me if something is true and I won't say no.

1796
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
And that's kind of where we're at.

1797
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:59,000
So we need I think the adopter process is one of the keys to disclosure.

1798
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Like let's keep submitting documents and get this stuff out.

1799
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:08,000
The NHI does not respect the monopoly the U.S. government thinks it has on this subject.

1800
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:16,000
And there are organizations worldwide that understand that that it's a worthwhile investment.

1801
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:22,000
They're not waiting on offices like Arrow or the president of the United States to tell them they should spend time and money on this.

1802
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,000
It's being done.

1803
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:29,000
And there are there are global crash recovery and reverse engineering programs outside the U.S.

1804
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:37,000
And I'm not referring to just governments, I'm referring to hybrid organizations, organizations that are extra governmental.

1805
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Listen, I'm not here to make anyone believe anything.

1806
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Like belief is a very personal thing.

1807
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
It's very personal.

1808
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:55,000
And the problem with this subject matter is well, one, it's very it's very intense because it carries such profound implications.

1809
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:06,000
I don't know that we have any more or less proof per se on this subject for the general public than we do other things that we probably accept more broadly than this subject.

1810
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:10,000
But it's because of the implications of this that people want to draw very hard lines on it.

1811
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:20,000
But man, if I think a good place to start is to humble yourself for everyone that's getting exposed to this right now, humble yourself from the perspective of what you consider believable.

1812
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:31,000
And I think a good measure or question to ask is like, how much do we currently take wholeheartedly and believe in that we act on every day?

1813
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:43,000
If I was asked you to remove everything from your life that you believe because someone else told you or you read somewhere or were taught that you don't have firsthand experience with, you'd be paralyzed and speechless.

1814
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:44,000
You wouldn't be able to function.

1815
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,000
You wouldn't get out of your house.

1816
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:54,000
If everybody had radical Cartesian doubt where it was like, I don't even know that that's a chair or what you're saying is real or whatever, you wouldn't be able to function.

1817
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,000
You wouldn't be able to operate.

1818
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:58,000
And this is where I just give up on trying to make people believe anything.

1819
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,000
I don't have time for that.

1820
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,000
I'm over it.

1821
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
This has been my life for a long time.

1822
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:10,000
I've got shit to do, and I have things I'm trying to make people believe does not interest me.

1823
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Well, it's extremely easy to sway the public in various ways and put guardrails on their thinking without them even knowing it.

1824
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
And so there's good critical thinking.

1825
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:28,000
There's this guy Thomas Bayes, a statistician from England in the 18th century, Bayesian thought, Bayesian reasoning.

1826
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:34,000
And it's like new data that you get should be evaluated in the context of your prior database.

1827
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:43,000
And if your prior database is like every time you hear the word UFO, you think snake oil, you think I'm going to throw it in the junk pile, you're building a bad data set.

1828
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
That's actually bad critical thinking.

1829
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:54,000
And if you were just open minded and you read this great book, UFOs and Nukes, which nobody can read who I recommended to because it's so dry and hard headed and it's 580 pages,

1830
02:16:54,000 --> 02:17:04,000
I think you have to come out with some sort of base case around UFOs being real and at least at the very least worthy of investigation.

1831
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Yeah, I would say the least credible thing in the equation is most people's basis for belief.

1832
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
What do you mean by that?

1833
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:23,000
That's the least credible thing is their basis for belief is not a reasonable, they're not taking a reasonable approach to their criteria for belief.

1834
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Their criteria for that is based on, well, what are you basing that on?

1835
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Like what research have you done?

1836
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:34,000
How have you disseminated fact from fiction to arrive at your current understanding?

1837
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:43,000
How do you know you haven't been subliminally programmed to be desensitized to one things and hypersensitized in a negative fashion to others?

1838
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
And you probably have.

1839
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:53,000
So you need to be thrown out as someone who should be making decisions for what you believe because your perspective is fucked.

1840
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:58,000
It's funny to see after this Sean Ryan story coming out, this Las Vegas bomber,

1841
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:04,000
cyber truck bomber from the Trump Tower, this bizarre like I don't know how to describe it.

1842
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
It's like this meme warfare act.

1843
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:09,000
It's hard to really understand and comprehend.

1844
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:20,000
And then you have this guy going on Sean Ryan shoemate saying that he received an email from the Green Beret himself bomber saying that basically there are Chinese

1845
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:28,000
gravitic drones flying over the eastern seaboard that could, if this is true, the payload delivery involved in these warp drive,

1846
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:33,000
gravitic drones could vaporize New York City or Washington, D.C. at the drop of a hat.

1847
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:36,000
And so this is what I find fascinating.

1848
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Bring it back to the whole like, you know, critical thinking thing.

1849
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:47,000
I've had more high powered Silicon Valley people hit me up about, oh, anti-gravity might be real.

1850
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,000
After that, it was just generically popular.

1851
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Yeah.

1852
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:58,000
And because of that, you have people who honestly I respect in many other contexts as far as their ability to operate, make money, do really cool things in the world.

1853
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Coming to me being like, oh, maybe the stuff you did on Townsend Brown, anti-gravity is real.

1854
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:11,000
It came into focus in a place they were already directing their attention rather than their intention being brought into where these facts exist.

1855
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,000
It's just all hypnosis and magic tricks.

1856
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Yeah.

1857
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:20,000
The Sean Ryan thing has really been hell for us the last two to three weeks.

1858
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:28,000
That's really touched our community and there's a lot of ties to that and our group of friends, let's say.

1859
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
And that's been something else.

1860
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:35,000
And it's a hot topic, you know, touching on the New Jersey thing.

1861
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,000
We were just out there.

1862
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:49,000
We were assigned to support the DOD and the FBI task force that was trying to be stood up out there, serving essentially as a hidden hand like we normally are dispatched,

1863
02:19:49,000 --> 02:20:03,000
to try and come in and offer something in order to declare this a hazard to public safety or to find criminal intent or criminal actions so that the FBI could have a basis.

1864
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Jake, what did you find out?

1865
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Well, that's where I'm going.

1866
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
I'm happy to tell you.

1867
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:11,000
The entire world is extremely confused.

1868
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:15,000
It feels like the highest levels of government are confused as to what is going on.

1869
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Okay.

1870
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,000
You know, our first day there, we got there.

1871
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:33,000
We were primarily focused to the activity in and around or above and around, I should say, Picatinny Arsenal, which is a government weapons installation, weapons focused, let's say, or weapons centric installation.

1872
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:38,000
First night there on the ground, we get our OPs set up and we're watching the skies.

1873
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:43,000
We're an organization I work for now, one of the founding members of.

1874
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:46,000
It's called Skywatcher, and we specialize in aerial intelligence.

1875
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:50,000
This is completely autonomous and an independent venture.

1876
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:56,000
It's full of full of guys like me that have worked in an official capacity for the government.

1877
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:09,000
We've brought our tools and talent and experience and are investing them into this private company and then trying to help the government where we can and also provide a window for the public into this subject and these technologies.

1878
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:18,000
So that being said, we show up in New Jersey first night on location within 30 minutes over Picatinny Arsenal.

1879
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:23,000
All these orange orbs come into existence right over Picatinny Arsenal.

1880
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Trying to do timestamps on how long they were there was difficult because it appeared about 40, 40, 45 minutes at a time, which is consistent with some traditional large battery powered drones.

1881
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:43,000
But what we can't tell is if that was the same drone or it was disappearing and reappearing.

1882
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:47,000
And that was the sensational language that was used more often.

1883
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:53,000
What it could mean is that they were turning their lights off and on, and that's why they were disappearing and reappearing.

1884
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:57,000
But were they only at night? Only at night for us.

1885
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,000
It was between like 1700 and midnight.

1886
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:05,000
So from five o'clock until about midnight is when we monitored or captured most of the activity.

1887
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:18,000
And so, you know, the problem with that whole thing out there is most of the data being collected and the reports were coming in were from unqualified observers on the ground using visual spectrum.

1888
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:22,000
So what I mean by that is humans looking up with their eyes and going, bro, what's that?

1889
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:27,000
It's also a very busy airspace around there. So there's airplanes, there's helicopters.

1890
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:40,000
I mean, if you really wanted to red team that situation, what I would have done is I would have put a bunch of glow sticks and helium balloons and tied them together and then sent them up in the air and watch people just lose their shit because you you wouldn't been able to discern.

1891
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:45,000
And then you shoot them with BB guns until they pop and disappear.

1892
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:51,000
There's so much room for fuckery in that situation that you it's hard to cut through the noise.

1893
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,000
What we were observing, because we are qualified observers, was not fuckery.

1894
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:58,000
There's something very concerning over Picatinny Arsenal.

1895
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:19,000
So the first thing we looked at was OK, these are probably large like drones that we know the classes of that are available out there in military inventory and in some civilian inventory that was turning off its lights in route and then on RTB and which is illegal.

1896
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
So there's our case for breaking laws right there.

1897
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:37,000
If this was in FAA controlled airspace, when a drone leaves the ground, first of all, UAS, an unmanned aerial system, has to have all the FAA approved lighting systems that any other aircraft does, and it has to have them on when it leaves the ground.

1898
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:42,000
It's also limited. You have to be a licensed operator and you're not allowed to fly above 400 feet.

1899
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:47,000
These were lights off over 400 feet over Picatinny Arsenal just sitting there and no one's doing shit about it.

1900
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:52,000
And weren't they sitting there for five hours plus? Sometimes, sometimes longer.

1901
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:57,000
And then so but we still don't know if it was just lights going off or they're popping into place.

1902
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Because while this is going on in the airspace south of there, we also were running a program that's more we're running operations, let's say, that's more more attuned for the UAP.

1903
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:16,000
The unidentifiable phenomenon.

1904
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:25,000
And we had UAP class stuff popping up to the south of there, coming in from the outer atmosphere and hovering into place and going back into space.

1905
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:28,000
What do you mean you were running operations more attuned to the UAP?

1906
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:39,000
We were looking for that. We were expecting that, looking for that and making sure we were paying attention for things that fit the box of possibly being.

1907
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Well, and UAP is a very safe word. UAP is the words are very you should say UAP more often because it means unidentified anomalous phenomenon.

1908
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I mean, I know you get I don't know how that becomes as concrete as if there's aliens and spaceships flying around.

1909
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:56,000
It's the opposite of clear or conclusive.

1910
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:01,000
So UAP is should be a safe word. So, yes, it was UAP and we were looking for UAP.

1911
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:07,000
We're looking specifically for things that we couldn't identify and clearly didn't fit into a box.

1912
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:19,000
The following nights, our plan was to get airborne and in our helicopter and get a closer look legally under the guidance of the FAA's air traffic control.

1913
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:28,000
What was interesting about the situation is that there was a TFR set up over Picatinny Arsenal a month prior, like before Thanksgiving.

1914
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:38,000
And the TFR is a temporary flight restriction, which is turns any airspace into a highly restricted airspace on a case by case basis.

1915
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:51,000
And so someone had the foresight or the reasoning to set up a TFR to restrict drone activity over Picatinny Arsenal weeks before Thanksgiving.

1916
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:56,000
We're there, you know, around Christmas or a little before Christmas.

1917
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
So this has been going on for a month in the area.

1918
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:03,000
And what's interesting about this TFR is it didn't restrict general aviation traffic.

1919
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:07,000
It could only restrict UAS, unmanned aerial systems.

1920
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:16,000
So what that means is any member of the general public who got in their civilian aircraft with the pilot's license could fly through that TFR with no restrictions.

1921
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:20,000
But a drone could not. So they were carving out for drones.

1922
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Well, the problem there is an aircraft could have an incursion with these drones.

1923
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:27,000
So everyone was pretending weren't there and was ignoring it.

1924
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:31,000
And now you have an accident or an incident, which is which is a safety risk.

1925
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:36,000
And when you get into safety risks for things that fly around in the air, things get serious really quick.

1926
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
And that was the biggest problem.

1927
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:47,000
And the biggest thing that wasn't being addressed that we were trying to make sure people were paying attention to was that to say there's no public risk, that's a really low hanging fruit.

1928
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Not the most exciting detail to anchor to in this thing.

1929
02:26:50,000 --> 02:27:02,000
But it's an anchor point where we could start digging and forcing people to give more concise reports from the DOD side, from the local law enforcement agencies, because nobody was working together there.

1930
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:08,000
There were over 59 local law enforcement entities working, not coordinating there.

1931
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:15,000
We had FBI, we had DOD, we had private partners on Picatinny.

1932
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Some from legacy programs that that are very popular were there with their very fancy tools and toys.

1933
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Everyone's doing their own thing.

1934
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Were you called in specifically because of your UAP retrieval experience?

1935
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:39,000
I wouldn't say my retrieval experience per se, but our team of guys were second to none.

1936
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:42,000
And I'm not being overly proud in saying that.

1937
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:51,000
So we were brought in more so on the behalf of DOD to help take a look at things and really contribute any way we can.

1938
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:55,000
But we found there was a lot of, there wasn't a lot of coordination going on.

1939
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:06,000
The powers that be, that we really don't know what's going on, or very few do, and they're clearly not communicating with the rest of our leadership and the public.

1940
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:15,000
I mean, that's a great sample of why this whole thing is so confusing, is the New Jersey drone incident.

1941
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:24,000
What did Trump mean when he said, it's probably not adversary, we know where the garage is, we could go into the garage.

1942
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Our military knows where they took off from.

1943
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:30,000
If it's a garage, they can go right into that garage.

1944
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:33,000
They know where it came from and where it went.

1945
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:36,000
God, you're asking me to know what Trump means.

1946
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:44,000
You're just asking another guy that's watching that on his phone like you.

1947
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:49,000
So what was your net assessment, just for the average person who's extremely confused?

1948
02:28:49,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Based on what we know from previous incursions at McDill and Langley Air Force Base this year as well, that there were Chinese nationals that were taken into custody.

1949
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:07,000
That's a very big problem, because if they are state actors, it's an act of war.

1950
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:11,000
And so how do we respond to an act of war?

1951
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:18,000
There are no good options, because either we look weak and vulnerable because we don't respond, or we do respond in what?

1952
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Now we're at war with China, which the world cannot afford.

1953
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:24,000
So there's a counterplay.

1954
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Now, if I was a Red Team member, when I look at it this lens, what I would do, if I was working, if America was my adversary, I would fake a Chinese invasion.

1955
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
It would be a false flag.

1956
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:46,000
I would make it look like China was doing this, and I would hire, you know, the billions of people that live in China aren't all singing the same song.

1957
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:51,000
There's plenty of disgruntled people there that are for hire, that work for other organizations worldwide,

1958
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:56,000
and are criminals in other capacities that aren't in line with China's intentions.

1959
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:07,000
So I would hire a Chinese national or someone from China and deploy them to make it look like China was causing the incursion in order to start a war with the U.S.

1960
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
for a number of nefarious purposes.

1961
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:12,000
So it could have been a false flag like that.

1962
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,000
The biggest problem with shooting them down, everyone's like, why don't you just shoot them down?

1963
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Well, this has pointed out a vulnerability we've known for a very long time with why there's a whole category of contracting in the U.S.

1964
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:32,000
called CUAS or counter UAS systems is because drone incursions are a problem because you can't shoot them down.

1965
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Because where they are most likely a problem is over a highly populated area like here, Dodger Stadium, let's say.

1966
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:43,000
You can't just shoot them down because then now they're going to fall and cause damage to people and property.

1967
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:44,000
So what do you do?

1968
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:49,000
You really can't do anything unless you can chase down who's operating them and take them into custody.

1969
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Okay.

1970
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:53,000
But do you think any of these were genuine non-human intelligence?

1971
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Any of these drones?

1972
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,000
You mentioned the Chinese national.

1973
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Yes, I do.

1974
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
And so why do you think that?

1975
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Because of the way they transitioned in and transitioned out.

1976
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Because of indications we got within our observation operations, the way we observe and collect data.

1977
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:28,000
That would be my guess is I do think that there was an NHI component to this combined, which is what makes it really confusing.

1978
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:31,000
You know, the biggest mystery of this whole thing is the mystery.

1979
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Like there shouldn't be a mystery.

1980
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:33,000
This is a very simple thing.

1981
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,000
There's something in the sky.

1982
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Go figure out what it is.

1983
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Find out who's flying it.

1984
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:38,000
It's over day one.

1985
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Right.

1986
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
This continues to happen over and over again.

1987
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
And we still are pretending like we're confused.

1988
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Which points to something that is far superior to us technologically that is ephemeral or weakly entangled with our reality and popping in and out and not something that is easily or prosaically understood.

1989
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:08,000
And in the case, I think what makes this so confusing is in the case in which it is genuine UAP, you would get probably our state of the art drones around there as well.

1990
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
We throw those out to kind of detect.

1991
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Yeah.

1992
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:17,000
And so you end up with this extremely kind of fuzzy mixed bag where it's much easier.

1993
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Again, I don't want to beat up on Sean Ryan.

1994
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
I think he's actually an amazing guy.

1995
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:27,000
But like you have him retweeting that like maybe there's like this loose nuke on the eastern seaboard.

1996
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,000
I was freaking out.

1997
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,000
I was texting Logan.

1998
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:32,000
We were freaking out about it for a day.

1999
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:37,000
And then there's something easier about that narrative, cleaner about that narrative.

2000
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Then it's actually just this complicated mix of non-human intelligence.

2001
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,000
People don't like mixtures.

2002
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:44,000
We want black and white.

2003
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:49,000
And, you know, Sean is just as vulnerable to that as we all are.

2004
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:53,000
I could tell you it wasn't loose nukes.

2005
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:58,000
And why I know that for sure is because I know people that work on the Nest team.

2006
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,000
I know people on.

2007
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:00,000
What is the Nest team?

2008
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:05,000
It's the nuclear emergency support team.

2009
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:11,000
And I also know people that work for the Weapons of Mass Destruction Directive under the Department of the FBI.

2010
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:12,000
They were there. Their families were there.

2011
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:15,000
They weren't like, get the fuck out of Dodge.

2012
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Like there's a loose nuke.

2013
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
So they wouldn't have had their kids there.

2014
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,000
They wouldn't have been like going to Target and buying churros.

2015
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
They were they were chilling out.

2016
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:26,000
So they weren't worried about a loose nuke at that time.

2017
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:29,000
So you really have to look that practically.

2018
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:35,000
We're going through this major shift where we're realizing we can't trust our institutions.

2019
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
We can't trust the narrative that's being presented.

2020
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
And people don't know how to respond to that.

2021
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:48,000
And I feel really bad for like like baby boom the good baby boomers because they're getting like vilified so much.

2022
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:52,000
But like my in-laws, the sweetest old people, like they've trusted the news and newspaper their whole life.

2023
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:55,000
They've trusted offices of the president.

2024
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:04,000
And it's real dangerous because there's this calling to like throw it all out, like get rid of all of our institutions, get rid of the government.

2025
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
And that's not the answer.

2026
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:21,000
What this needs to be is a call to action for all brave, well-rounded people with work ethic and a deep sense of meaning to start occupying positions within institutions and offices.

2027
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Like we just need to occupy these positions of power and seize our institutions.

2028
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:35,000
And this is everything from like the Catholic Church to the World Health Organization to police departments.

2029
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Like so many good people I know that are cops are like, screw this, especially around the George Floyd incident and all the fallout from defund the police are like, I'm retired.

2030
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,000
I'm good now.

2031
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:54,000
We're just going to turn the police department over to those who would work under these conditions and these new standards of like you don't have to be able to do a pull up or run.

2032
02:34:54,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Like you can be overweight and like and try and like protect and serve.

2033
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,000
And so, and same in the military.

2034
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:13,000
So many people have gotten out because of how, how, why maybe the spirit of D E I or some like to rearrange it D I E because it's, it's a death sentence.

2035
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:18,000
But the spirit of that makes sense to all good people.

2036
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Like every one of us in the military is here to risk our life so that you can be free to say whatever you want and orient yourself sexually with everyone.

2037
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:31,000
But it's being gone about the wrong way.

2038
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:32,000
And so people are punching out.

2039
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:33,000
And that's the last thing we want to do.

2040
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:44,000
We have to, if you want, if you're willing to sacrifice your life and some glorified, glorified sexy way of like jumping on a grenade for your buddy and having an awesome funeral.

2041
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Well, then be willing to put up with an environment that rubs you the wrong way.

2042
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Like stay in your sacrifice is more nuanced than the glory of a fantastic death.

2043
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:06,000
You need to stay in your job and put up with political HR shit and occupy positions of leadership and then make changes.

2044
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
That's the only way this works.

2045
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:18,000
That is a beautiful and not nihilistic message to a lot of people who I think have felt cheated by the establishment and institutions over decades.

2046
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:23,000
And I do think often the blame gets sometimes fairly, sometimes unfairly pinned on the baby boomers.

2047
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:27,000
And so I mean, yeah, it's important to not throw the baby out with the bath water.

2048
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:30,000
The final thing I think we should just talk about on the New Jersey drone thing.

2049
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:34,000
And then I think we should move on is on the point of good critical thinking.

2050
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:43,000
These quote unquote drones seem to be showing up consistently around sensitive military sites and all over the world, not just in New Jersey.

2051
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:47,000
So Picatinny Arsenal is one place that's where they initially seem to show up.

2052
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:48,000
But you have Lake and Heath.

2053
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:52,000
You have Salem Nuclear Power Plant in Jersey.

2054
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:56,000
You have Brunswick Duke Energy Power Plant in North Carolina.

2055
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:00,000
And this just totally comports with Robert Hastings' work on UFOs and nukes.

2056
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:04,000
So I do think it's important to put this in its proper context.

2057
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:09,000
That what we're seeing today, if you actually have that context, is probably what we've seen historically.

2058
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:12,000
You have these UFO flaps historically.

2059
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Yes, it's just ridiculous that it's happening now and that we don't know how to respond to it.

2060
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:19,000
We don't know how to discern what it is.

2061
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:25,000
And the drones, even if let's say it's drones, that would still freak people out.

2062
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
I mean, you could go.

2063
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:28,000
You could even YouTube.

2064
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:29,000
You don't even have to go.

2065
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:41,000
But if you've ever been to like a tech trade show where someone like GM or Chrysler is like showing their new prototype for a flying car, which is essentially a quadcopter just like sleeked out, it's incredible.

2066
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,000
It looks crazy.

2067
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:45,000
And it's a real thing that you could hop in and fly right now.

2068
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:52,000
And there's no reason another nation or some autonomous organization that's that's based out of Mexico where doesn't have to follow U.S.

2069
02:37:52,000 --> 02:38:00,000
laws like some billionaire couldn't put together a plan to get off the off the shore of New Jersey and the Atlantic Ocean and launch a bunch of these.

2070
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
And some of them can launch off the water.

2071
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:05,000
They could go from the water, not under, but from the water to the sky.

2072
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:10,000
And it looks like something out of, you know, historically would like a movie.

2073
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,000
Are there underwater UFO bases?

2074
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:14,000
I would think so.

2075
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:19,000
Yeah, yeah, that seems to be the case.

2076
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Yeah.

2077
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Interesting.

2078
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:34,000
And this was part of the challenge of my journey and how it took me a long time to get to the point to where I realized, you know, what we're dealing with is NHI versus our own advanced technology, because there is a spectrum.

2079
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:42,000
I mean, we've kind of filled the gap, at least from an ignorant standpoint, unless you have the right way to analyze what you're observing.

2080
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:52,000
And I use those terms broadly because we there's so much more than a human looking up with with like ultraviolet sensing eyeballs.

2081
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Like there's more than that.

2082
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:58,000
And so but there is such a spectrum that it is it is hard to discern.

2083
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
There's a lot of belief involved.

2084
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:25,000
I want to put my cynic hat on for a second and ask some audience surrogate questions because I think a lot of people are probably just freaked out a little ontologically shocked at some of these claims.

2085
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:28,000
So there's this conspiracy theory called Project Blue Beam.

2086
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:36,000
There are people out there that think that this is all being orchestrated by the deep state that these orbs or crafts will show up.

2087
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:46,000
It'll be an auspice for which to clamp down and create a surveillance state or to create some fake, you know, antichrist like religious awakening.

2088
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Yeah, that is, you know, completely a sham.

2089
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:52,000
What do you have anything to say to that?

2090
02:39:53,000 --> 02:40:04,000
There has been an organized and an unorganized effort on behalf of the U.S. government to to disclose some of this stuff.

2091
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:10,000
I mean, as early as I mean, as recent as like 2015 16.

2092
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:15,000
I mean, a tip was certainly part of that effort.

2093
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:20,000
But like, I don't think that should be looked at negatively.

2094
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:29,000
I mean, those who are the gatekeepers or those who are holding the secrets or have the power to release it, let's say, first of all, it's not one group.

2095
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
It's multiple. Like, what would you want them to do with it?

2096
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Like, we can't complain that they're not telling us anything or they're putting out some organized disclosure program and soft serving it to us.

2097
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I think I think that, well, first of all, that has been done.

2098
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:53,000
And whether or not that's a bad idea or not, I don't know.

2099
02:40:53,000 --> 02:41:07,000
So I think the philosophical question that naturally arises here is you are implementing techniques that seem like you're almost tapping into this sacred other spiritual world.

2100
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:12,000
But you're sort of doing it on behalf of American defense.

2101
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Obviously, you've shown that your loyalty transcends just pure organizational expedience and realizing that this is actually bad for the country, the way this thing was set up.

2102
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:27,000
But what about loyalty above that, even this metaphysical loyalty, loyalty to God?

2103
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:41,000
And if these things are angels or celestial creatures, how do you square the fact that we're moving in kind of celestial realms, but we're kind of, you know, using the frame of American defense with all this stuff?

2104
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Yeah, that's a fun question.

2105
02:41:44,000 --> 02:42:00,000
And we're all forced to consider it once you get to this point, like the angels and demons idea, I think, is a good place to kind of orient the idea of what we're dealing with, because there certainly is good energy and bad energy at play.

2106
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:06,000
My experience has been, I would say, 100% good energy, like profoundly good.

2107
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:18,000
So for whatever reason, if this is an atypical experience or if it only represents one half of the experiences people have with the NHI energy, that's fine.

2108
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:28,000
But mine has been unbelievably positive and has been life changing and has guided me and given me orientation and motivation and clarity.

2109
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
It gives me so many things.

2110
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:41,000
It's like being tapped into something like a guiding light or an omnipresent God that has your best will at heart.

2111
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:59,000
But the question comes up often in our circle of friends, let's say, the question of are these things or is this phenomenon benevolent or malevolent?

2112
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:05,000
And the answer is yes, because much like us, they're both.

2113
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:08,000
We have the capacity for both good and evil.

2114
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:24,000
And since we're talking philosophically and beyond, the universe itself has a pretty consistent set of elements and structure that we've already observed.

2115
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:32,000
So to think that there's something like good and evil that exists throughout all domains and dimensions and distances makes a lot of sense.

2116
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:40,000
It would also explain a lot of what we're hearing through the echoes of history related to the phenomenon, angels and demons.

2117
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
So that makes a lot of sense.

2118
02:43:42,000 --> 02:44:02,000
And it's important to not be naive and assume that there's no reason to be worried about a higher life form or a more technologically advanced life form or a more dominant life form.

2119
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Let's just put it that way, whether it lives in our three dimensional space or it's extradimensional, it could be a real problem, which is why, on one hand, for better or for worse, the government is the primary custodian on this knowledge and this hardware.

2120
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:27,000
And they're the hammer that identifies everything as a nail.

2121
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:36,000
They're a military based organization, so they're going to look for advantages for offense and defense.

2122
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:45,000
And, you know, it's easy to point fingers and say that's disgusting and this should be about love, but that's not the way the world works.

2123
02:44:45,000 --> 02:45:00,000
And the freedom we experience, and I'm qualified to speak on this from both sides, like I'm a human, I have love in my heart, I'm open minded, I'm caring, I'm sensitive, but I'm also a trained soldier.

2124
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:12,000
And so I understand the value of that and we live in the benefits that have been provided to us from a military state, from a military dominance on this planet.

2125
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:17,000
And to assume, to take that for granted is very unwise.

2126
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:21,000
So, you know, it's like the good analogy is like a kitchen knife.

2127
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Kitchen knife could be used to make beautiful food for your family.

2128
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:30,000
It could be used to defend yourself or to maliciously kill another human.

2129
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Is a knife good or bad?

2130
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:38,000
It's the intention of the being wielding it that makes the difference.

2131
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:55,000
This brings up the next logical question, which is that the OSAP program, which ran from 2007 to 2012 under the auspices of Harry Reid, a lot of these guys were digging holes and looking into kind of exotic weaponry and they were doing it on Skinwalker Ranch.

2132
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:59,000
And a lot of them reported this quote unquote hitchhiker effect.

2133
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
And so all sorts of orbs.

2134
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:05,000
But honestly, hauntings, like really paranormal bad day.

2135
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:08,000
It's like as if they played with a Ouija board following them home.

2136
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:13,000
And so it does seem like what you put in is what you get out.

2137
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:16,000
It's like that new radical song, you know, get what you give.

2138
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:19,000
Yeah. And so that might be part of it.

2139
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Seek and ye shall find.

2140
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Yeah.

2141
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:30,000
And so I am also of the mind that protecting the free world is not something we can take for granted.

2142
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:37,000
And so my hope is that whatever good NHI, you know, are there like agree with that.

2143
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:44,000
And then at the same time, if you're antagonizing any of the good NHI and they're just actually just superior to us.

2144
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:45,000
I worry about that somewhat.

2145
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:52,000
And if you're doing it in the name of country, but your country doesn't always act in the best possible way.

2146
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:56,000
I mean, you mentioned the term false flag before.

2147
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Yeah.

2148
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:04,000
The history of American foreign policy is not the history of perfect, you know, moral alignment with the higher good.

2149
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:07,000
No, it means the ends justified by means.

2150
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Often, often.

2151
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:14,000
And so, yeah, how do you how do you think about all that going forward?

2152
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Man, I think we should decentralize the ideas.

2153
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:31,000
And what I mean by that is one thing I hope comes of all of this is we encourage every individual to start looking into answering this question themselves,

2154
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:37,000
not only by just doing your own research online, but inside.

2155
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
Don't look inside as much as looking out.

2156
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Walk outside.

2157
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Look to the sky.

2158
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Try doing something like praying.

2159
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:45,000
You don't have to pray.

2160
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:46,000
Come up with another word for it.

2161
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:53,000
If that's too like if there's too much like Judeo-Christian stigma with that word,

2162
02:47:53,000 --> 02:48:00,000
like walk outside, look at the sky, open your heart and ask for the good energy of the universe to show something to you.

2163
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:01,000
And it's that simple.

2164
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Like stuff can happen in our experience just by doing that.

2165
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:10,000
You talk about the hitchhiker effect and I shared that most of my experience has been positive,

2166
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:16,000
but I haven't shared that stuff has followed me home and that my family sees it.

2167
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
We have stuff show up over our house.

2168
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:25,000
We have a UAP we call the angel that shows up and it looks like it has or wings.

2169
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:29,000
It's blue and it comes in, materializes, hangs out over the house.

2170
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:30,000
It's seen by neighbors.

2171
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,000
It's seen by everybody.

2172
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:32,000
And then it's gone.

2173
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:33,000
It shoots into outer space.

2174
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:42,000
The classic, the wings, that describes a seraphim, you know, like an ancient kind of Hebraic angel.

2175
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
I mean, it makes sense.

2176
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:45,000
And that's the first time we saw it.

2177
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:46,000
My son saw it.

2178
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:47,000
We thought it was cloud.

2179
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:51,000
It's like there's not a cloud in the sky, but it seemed cloudy around this thing.

2180
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:54,000
But it had like wings.

2181
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:01,000
It was blue and it had like more like butterfly wings than like what we see in like angel bird wings.

2182
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:05,000
And you think that that's somehow protecting you or good or?

2183
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:08,000
It feels like a good energy.

2184
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:13,000
Like we can feel that energy I got in the aircraft that night is that same energy I get.

2185
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:16,000
I mean, it puts my my son in tears.

2186
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:23,000
It puts like and he's not afraid like he's moved and it's incredible.

2187
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:26,000
So like how do you explain that?

2188
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:33,000
That's a good way to to maybe if you want to start being your own little amateur scientist,

2189
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:40,000
if you walk outside and you open your heart to the good spirit of the universe and you ask for something specific,

2190
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:44,000
it seems like a silly exercise and something happens.

2191
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Let's say you did a craft.

2192
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Did you just summon advanced human technology?

2193
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Did Edwards Air Force dispatch dispatch an aircraft and hovered over your house?

2194
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
Probably not.

2195
02:49:55,000 --> 02:50:01,000
So it's probably more likely like there's something anomalous or NHI based with that situation.

2196
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:06,000
And do you think that the inner outer dichotomy is a false one

2197
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:12,000
and that these things are somehow excavations of what's inside of you?

2198
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:16,000
And maybe future science is actually a more spiritual science.

2199
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:21,000
There's this 19th century Austrian philosopher named Rudolf Steiner who talks about anthroposophy

2200
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:27,000
where it's studying the inner in order to garner mastery over the outer world.

2201
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:31,000
That was what alchemy was about as well.

2202
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
I think it's all on the table now.

2203
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
That's like that's what's fun.

2204
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:38,000
But also crazy about this is like there's so much on the table.

2205
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:39,000
There's so much to be explored.

2206
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
And this is what I appreciate about Gary.

2207
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Dr. Nolan's attitude is that he he thinks this is the greatest moment ever for science,

2208
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:51,000
not like something that's ridiculous.

2209
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Well, I think what's beautiful about it is that since the Enlightenment,

2210
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:59,000
science and the spirit have cleaved off and bifurcated.

2211
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:02,000
And if you were to go back to Francis Bacon,

2212
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:07,000
he would say I am using the scientific method was back then, you know,

2213
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:08,000
more empirical skepticism.

2214
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
It wasn't called that at the time.

2215
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:13,000
But I'm using that in order to discover God's secrets.

2216
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:16,000
And since then, now you have like, you know, Richard Dawkins,

2217
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
who's like this, you know, extremely, you know,

2218
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:22,000
is just atheist and he sort of, you know, disrespects anybody that believes.

2219
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:26,000
And then on the other side, you have religious fundamentalists

2220
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:29,000
who don't take science super seriously and will like throw Darwin out.

2221
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Like it like isn't even an effective local theory, which is probably, you know,

2222
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
it probably has some use as a theory.

2223
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:40,000
No, I love that point because it's it's something like the beauty of why a

2224
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:44,000
children, a child could ask why infinitely and it can annoy an adult.

2225
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
It's like, why, why, why?

2226
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Because you can track that.

2227
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:51,000
And the fact that you can't put a lid on it or dead in that line of questioning

2228
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:54,000
means that there's something that adult is missing in that scenario.

2229
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:59,000
And that's the way I see the approach of the scientific method or thinking that

2230
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:05,000
the I that the pursuit of science is somehow is askew to the pursuit of God,

2231
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:10,000
because even within the scientific method, where did that come from and why

2232
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:11,000
was it created?

2233
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:16,000
Why do you think it's worthwhile to have a method to objectively evaluate your

2234
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
environment?

2235
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:23,000
You would have to believe that it leads to a what you consider a good outcome.

2236
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Now, that leads to the next question.

2237
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Well, what what is a good outcome and why do you care about what good is?

2238
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Totally.

2239
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:38,000
You so you can't get away even in this this high horse of science and the

2240
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:43,000
scientific method from the pursuit of science, because if you're a scientist,

2241
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
it's because you love science.

2242
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:51,000
You want you have interest and an intuition that that going down this road

2243
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:55,000
objectively through the method is going to lead to something worthwhile for you.

2244
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:59,000
And you just look right back around to understanding that you were seeking

2245
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
something good and worthwhile.

2246
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Where does that come from?

2247
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:08,000
Yeah, and maybe science and religion are, you know, bottoms of the pyramid.

2248
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:12,000
And if you ascend, you get to some omega point at the top where they meet.

2249
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:16,000
And there's a great Meister Eckhart quote, theologians may quarrel, but

2250
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
mystics all speak the same language.

2251
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:25,000
And I do think if you are just intaking information in search of the truth,

2252
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:29,000
I think that's that's a that's a process that is agnostic.

2253
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:32,000
You know, science is one method, religion is another.

2254
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:36,000
But we're all sort of seeking some some sort of outcome.

2255
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:40,000
And Jesus even says in the Book of Mark, he says some I'm paraphrasing,

2256
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:43,000
but it's something like what you measure, you'll get more of.

2257
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:48,000
And so it's where you point your attention and intention.

2258
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:52,000
And that seems to be something that is consistent with the phenomenon

2259
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:56,000
when you talk about attracting the good or the evil spirits.

2260
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:00,000
I mean, make no mistake, there have been dark things that have happened

2261
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:04,000
within C.R. C.R.

2262
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
to other groups. Yeah.

2263
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:07,000
To other groups.

2264
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:12,000
And I'm not going to talk about that, but just it doesn't mean, though,

2265
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:19,000
those who hate talking about it this way in in the U.A.P.

2266
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:24,000
culture don't want us talking about the negative, want us to focus on the positive.

2267
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:28,000
It's because they think that that means our behavior should change.

2268
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
But it's it's complex like anything.

2269
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Like it's the good still exists, even though there's bad.

2270
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:39,000
But you can't you have to acknowledge that there are there are dangers

2271
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
associated with it.

2272
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:44,000
If you're an audience member at this point, I think you're probably wondering

2273
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:49,000
you're having a burning question, which is what about space aliens?

2274
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:53,000
This all seems to be talk of spirituality, inner outer orbs,

2275
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
that sort of thing.

2276
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:59,000
Where do we have any evidence that these things come from other planets?

2277
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:02,000
I don't know.

2278
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:06,000
I'll I'll give you one piece of information that people may have gotten

2279
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:09,000
out of the stuff that's come out the last couple of years.

2280
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
But this this will help.

2281
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
And it may not be the answer everyone wants.

2282
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:17,000
But, you know, there's a reason we use the term biologics.

2283
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:24,000
And there's a reason Dave really hung his hat on that phrase every time he

2284
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:25,000
used it.

2285
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:32,000
That's because biologics didn't doesn't necessarily mean sentient beings

2286
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:35,000
or conscious creatures.

2287
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:40,000
It could be something like a drone from another place like we do.

2288
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:41,000
We send our drones.

2289
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:45,000
We have like, say, gone sent Voyager out like we've all done these things

2290
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:46,000
or not.

2291
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:49,000
We've all but our government has done many drone programs, Mars rovers,

2292
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:50,000
et cetera.

2293
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:57,000
So the biologics could be something like soft tissue drones while some of

2294
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:05,000
the biological cargo that comes with these craft is not conscious.

2295
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Consciousness itself is how you interact and pilot the craft,

2296
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:13,000
which is ironic because for the first time ever,

2297
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:17,000
the biological creatures inside are not conscious, but the craft is.

2298
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Well, it's funny you say that DARPA at this very moment is looking into a

2299
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:24,000
field called computational biology.

2300
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:29,000
And we're looking at how do we manipulate the biological world,

2301
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:32,000
create an anatomical compiler, if you will.

2302
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:37,000
And we're starting to understand how cells operate on a more granular level.

2303
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:42,000
And so you'd have to think some civilization either on another planet or

2304
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:47,000
ours with a lot more time, energy and expertise maybe has figured out

2305
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:48,000
something like that.

2306
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
And that brings me to my next question,

2307
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:54,000
which is a lot of people talk about being abducted by these gray aliens.

2308
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:58,000
And a lot of the people who describe these abductions say that the gray

2309
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:04,000
aliens are sort of droid-like robotic creatures that seem to be sent almost

2310
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:08,000
as like messengers where they're doing these specific retrievals and

2311
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:09,000
insertions.

2312
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:13,000
So insertions of implants and then retrievals of gametes,

2313
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
genetic material, that sort of thing.

2314
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Do you have any take on any of this stuff?

2315
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Man, that stuff, first of all,

2316
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:24,000
I have zero experience with gray or beings or meeting something face-to-face.

2317
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:25,000
I'd love to do it.

2318
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
It sounds fun to me.

2319
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:28,000
Sign me up.

2320
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:31,000
But I mean, as crazy as it sounds,

2321
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:37,000
the most trusted people in my circle that I have worked with and do work with

2322
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:44,000
and have those speak to having those firsthand experiences with.

2323
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
And so it's like, what do you do with that?

2324
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:51,000
And now I'm in the seat of, well, where's the proof?

2325
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
I want to believe that.

2326
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:54,000
How can I get there?

2327
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:57,000
And I can't because that's where it's like,

2328
02:57:57,000 --> 02:58:01,000
I understand where people are taking my information and trying to get there

2329
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:02,000
with me, and you just can't.

2330
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
I just can't get there.

2331
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:08,000
But it's awfully intriguing because I believe that they believe that that

2332
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
happened.

2333
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:15,000
And there are reports that we do have biologics in storage,

2334
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:16,000
and we just don't know what that is.

2335
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:22,000
But this is all the more reason why I'm excited to move forward in this new

2336
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:28,000
venture and the fact that we have created our own autonomy and that we're

2337
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
going out, we have a budget, we're operating,

2338
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
and we're in a public-private partnership.

2339
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:37,000
And I hope to answer all these questions.

2340
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:42,000
If all things go well, before I'm trying not to say a date,

2341
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:45,000
but within the first half of 2025,

2342
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:50,000
we hope to do a demonstration and invite key members of the public from

2343
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:55,000
institutions and demonstrate this and maybe even get something to the

2344
02:58:55,000 --> 02:59:00,000
ground if we can do it legally in coordination with our government

2345
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
partners, which we have to do.

2346
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
We can't just go rogue and do this without them.

2347
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:05,000
They have to be involved.

2348
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:08,000
But it is likely that we'll have an opportunity to do that,

2349
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
and that's going to answer a lot of questions.

2350
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:12,000
That would be absolutely insane.

2351
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:15,000
Look, man, like, the skies aren't classified.

2352
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
Your conscience can't be redacted.

2353
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
So get out there and start looking up.

2354
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:24,000
Start looking in.

2355
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:27,000
Yeah, that's part of the reason I'm here is because, you know,

2356
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:30,000
I just became a dad, a dad of a daughter who's three months old.

2357
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:36,000
And I look at this little lady and I feel like this responsibility for

2358
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:42,000
helping at least to shape a positive world that heads towards progression

2359
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
in the right direction.

2360
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:49,000
And I think this closure is a much bigger conversation that will open a

2361
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
lot of people's eyes.

2362
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:56,000
One thing you said to me on us on the on the first phone call we had is,

2363
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:59,000
you know, people talk about this feeling of ontological shock where it's

2364
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:03,000
like it's really hard for a lot of people to face the reality that their

2365
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
entire worldview is being challenged.

2366
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
And I certainly felt that.

2367
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:10,000
But one thing you said that I liked was you like to think of it as

2368
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:15,000
ontological relief where it's like actually some of the questions about

2369
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:18,000
like when I look up in the sky, it's like, what am I?

2370
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:19,000
What are we?

2371
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:20,000
How are we here?

2372
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:27,000
You know, at least there's like some semblance of answers or something a

2373
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:32,000
little more that's explained that actually makes me go, huh,

2374
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:36,000
all right, it's making a little bit more sense than it was before.

2375
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:41,000
Yeah, no, it's something like giving up atheism when you become a parent

2376
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:44,000
because you're like, this can't be all.

2377
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
I can't be the smartest person in the room.

2378
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:50,000
I can't be the richest or most influential person in the room.

2379
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
I can't be the most powerful person in the room.

2380
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
This is for the president when he goes to sleep at night.

2381
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
Like, I'm not qualified.

2382
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:57,000
Like, I need there to be more.

2383
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
I need there to be deeper meaning.

2384
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:02,000
I need there to be more connection between us.

2385
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:08,000
I because every person, even the bad guys that we run into in life at one

2386
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:11,000
time, we're just an innocent little baby.

2387
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:14,000
And there's something sweet and meaningful in every human.

2388
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
And that's what this whole thing offers.

2389
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:17,000
Like is this woo woo?

2390
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:23,000
Is that sounds like that's the best thing that could be harvested by

2391
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:24,000
acknowledging this.

2392
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:32,000
And it's got this this cold military political industrial like stigma

2393
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:33,000
attached to it.

2394
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:34,000
But that's not it.

2395
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:37,000
It's not about like flying equipment.

2396
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:41,000
Like, oh, can we get in a flying saucer and like get to London in two

2397
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
minutes or could we get there yesterday?

2398
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
Because now we know like screw all that.

2399
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
The real implications are way more powerful.

2400
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:52,000
And it's it's realizing that there is something else out there that's maybe

2401
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:53,000
not extra at all.

2402
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
It's something that's part of us.

2403
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:58,000
It's like outer space versus inner space is all the same.

2404
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:03,000
And so I hope there's something really beautiful on the other side of this,

2405
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
which is why we need more people involved.

2406
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
We need religious communities involved.

2407
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:13,000
We need like we need the leftist most tree hugging spiritual people to get

2408
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:19,000
into this thing that's been controlled and been locked up by the most like

2409
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:23,000
tyrannical right wing leaning people.

2410
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:29,000
This is to me one of the most important stories in a millennium,

2411
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:34,000
let alone a century, because it should make everybody question core

2412
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:35,000
ontological truths.

2413
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:41,000
And like you said, hopefully open their eyes to a broader reality that is,

2414
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
I think, expansive and exciting.

2415
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,000
So thank you, man.

2416
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Well, thank you.

2417
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:47,000
The pleasure is mine.

2418
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:51,000
Let's make sure we get this out there so that future generations aren't having

2419
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
to rediscover this thing all over again.

2420
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:54,000
Let's do it.

2421
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:55,000
Yeah.

2422
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:00,000
Huge news, everyone.

2423
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:04,000
We've been sitting on a ton of unreleased footage that we will now be

2424

releasing weekly in our new walk.

2425
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:11,000
Our first episode is a completely uncut heated discussion between how put off

2426
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
and Eric Weinstein on remote viewing.

2427
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Yeah, you heard that right.

2428
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:18,000
I still can't believe I experienced that firsthand.

2429
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:22,000
