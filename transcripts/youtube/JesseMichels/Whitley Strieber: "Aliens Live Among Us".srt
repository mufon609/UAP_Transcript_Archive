1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
I think, oh my God, I have a shotgun under the bed and a pistol in the side table.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,440
I'm from Texas and I'm going to be gunned up at all times.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,980
At some point I was standing in front of the bookstore and that book just stood out for

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:22,080
me and it was something about seeing the eyes again that almost created a moment of regression.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,820
It might be that this is a time right now where we have to be very careful about preserving

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,700
our dominion of our reality.

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,780
There's something in your body that you believe is an implant.

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,780
I feel it right here.

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,780
Can we see it?

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,100
If you touch it, you can't, I don't, you touch it if you want to.

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,740
I feel like two years I can give you a CT scan, I would agree.

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,740
Is it okay?

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,740
Was it weird if I touch it or is it okay?

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,740
No, it's fine.

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,740
Doesn't matter.

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,340
But I feel like it might be a little hot because it's been working.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,020
Two, three years ago?

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,820
Two, three years ago if you had...

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,820
If you had told someone.

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,820
Go ahead, touch it.

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,820
I'm scared.

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,820
Here, here.

23
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,660
I'm kind of scared.

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,380
It's right under my finger now.

25
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,500
Oh my god.

26
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:37,940
We are here with the legendary Whitley Strieber outside of writing maybe the archetypal alien

27
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:45,820
abduction book Communion in 1987, which sold an incredible amount of copies, inspired a

28
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,940
Christopher Walken movie and has started all sorts of mythological lore and really made

29
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:57,540
it acceptable for other direct experiencers to come out along with doing so many other

30
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,540
things.

31
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,900
I just bought a book by Stanton Friedman called Top Secret.

32
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,740
It's about the majestic 12 and you wrote the foreword to it and so you seem to kind of

33
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:12,660
pop up everywhere and I'm also joined by the amazing Amar Kandeel who is the number one

34
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:19,020
supporter of American Alchemy, is one third or one fourth of Yes Theory, founder of Yes

35
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,980
Theory and I'm always so honored to be graced by his presence at our very small humble operation

36
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,980
at American Alchemy.

37
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,100
It's my favorite operation on YouTube that's for sure and it's always an honor to just

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,420
do this together and meet all the amazing people that you just brought into my life

39
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,700
over the past three years.

40
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,700
Appreciate you man.

41
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,460
Well you've been really pushing me to do this.

42
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,620
You and Whitley met, we all met actually at the Soul Conference.

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,100
We got lunch before that but we kind of reconvened at the Soul Conference which was held by Gary

44
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,780
Nolan at Stanford last year and you guys really hit it off and since then Amar has been like

45
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,620
you got to interview Whitley, you got to interview Whitley.

46
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,900
Yeah well I'm glad you're doing it.

47
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:06,780
Adding to Jesse's intro and even emphasizing the title Legendary, I mean you know I put

48
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,300
this on, it's my first time wearing it and I think about like it's just this figure,

49
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:20,020
our modern depiction of the grace and how much that was massively influenced by you

50
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,180
and the book and Communion and you being able to have the sketch be so accurate that

51
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,420
it just awakens something in millions.

52
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,100
Yeah it was the eyes mainly that awakened something in people.

53
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:38,180
I have to say though if they finally land and come out and they don't look like that

54
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,820
I will experience the most profound embarrassment in human history in my opinion.

55
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,500
Because you think that they will look slightly different.

56
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,580
No I don't think they'll look different.

57
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,180
Well they're not going to look exactly like they cover but they're going to have those

58
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,780
big eyes I'm pretty sure.

59
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,940
You're responsible for the emoji we all use while texting.

60
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,540
No and it's been such a theme over the past you know four years of looking into this topic

61
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:12,700
and meeting people with Jesse and without Jesse, constantly come back to in the 90s

62
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,420
at some point I was standing in front of a bookstore and that book just like stood out

63
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,620
for me and something about seeing the eyes again that almost created like a moment of

64
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,980
regression for so many experiencers and I almost reflect now you know this is the end

65
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:34,260
of 2024 the entire country seems to be talking about drones and UFOs and it's like the most

66
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,820
in the zeitgeist that's been in my lifetime and yeah and I think about like the other

67
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:47,820
moment that you know before the 2000 where that happened was when Communion came out.

68
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,540
But there's a significant difference between the two times because when Communion came

69
00:04:52,540 --> 00:05:00,560
out it's very interesting I was told a publication date and then all of a sudden the books were

70
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:08,460
in bookstores and my editor was very coy about I said what you jumped it in other words books

71
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,900
boxes of books appeared without warning at bookstores all over the country and he said

72
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,940
well we felt like there was some kind of resistance I said what do you mean he said I'm not sure and

73
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,940
I don't know whether he meant I'm not sure I should tell you or I'm not sure of the resistance

74
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:33,180
but for some reason they jumped the book about two weeks and it showed up you know when I was

75
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:42,460
writing that book it crossed my mind that it was going to initiate contact for the ordinary people

76
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:48,820
which is exactly what it did I don't know I might have frozen up I mean it never occurred to me

77
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:56,100
never even crossed my mind I was aware by then that there were people inside the government who

78
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:03,660
had had a certain amount of contact because I had met a space scientist David W. Webb who

79
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:10,820
had come into our lives I think through Stanton Friedman the UFO researcher and he was very well

80
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,020
connected in the intelligence community and very supportive and very friendly and he met

81
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,660
us for dinner and came and stayed at the cabin and said it was I was doing a wonderful thing

82
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:27,420
and so forth and so on he's very sweet so I knew the government was aware of this of this whole

83
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:34,380
abduction scenario and I think now that they've understood the full extent of it they might not

84
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:44,620
be so willing to say they were aware of it then but in any case the fact that this period this

85
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:51,140
thing that happened in 85 initiated contact is still sort of surprises me because I don't feel

86
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:57,460
like this sort of person I don't feel like I don't see how it could be me that did it and that's

87
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,940
exactly why I felt like we needed to have a conversation with you because now that just

88
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:08,300
people are more accepting of the idea that the NHI is most likely involved with disclosure and

89
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,020
things moving in the way they have been I often think I'm like well something was very specific

90
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:22,220
about choosing you to have this experience knowing your background successful writer we know could

91
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:29,060
deliver an experience and articulate what you went through in a way that can make other people

92
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:36,260
connect with that and I often come back to like how do you make sense of that today?

93
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:44,060
Oh I know exactly why they chose me I can tell you precisely well they chose me for a number of

94
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:51,140
reasons first it's a family affair my one of my uncles was heavily involved in this at right

95
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:58,860
path no he's my uncle Mickey and General Exxon were worked at the Air Materiel Command in 47

96
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,300
and my father was apparently involved but he was so secretive I I have no idea whether or not he

97
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:13,780
was no no he was he was in the well he was in the army during the war and then there were a couple

98
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:19,780
of incidents in childhood that seemed to me in retrospect to involve this but I'm that's not

99
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:29,100
where I want to go right now where where I'd like to go right now is into this this issue of

100
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:36,860
why me and that was part of it I mean I don't want to go down the road of the details about

101
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:44,740
the family connection but the most important part is and I have come to an awareness and I'm pretty

102
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:52,580
sure I'm right that they are very concerned about something called cultural colonization in other

103
00:08:52,580 --> 00:09:05,140
words if they show up with this amazing array of being skills technology mind they're gonna

104
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,420
overwhelm us and make us feel completely disempowered and they don't want that they're

105
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,660
not looking for slaves they're looking for friends and they don't want us to be running

106
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,660
around behind them begging for their cell phones or whatever their cell phones to the beyond or

107
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:29,380
whatever they have and so the choice of this guy I can tell a good story I'm an efficient writer

108
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:38,820
but I don't come from authority I'm not a scientist I'm not Carl Sagan I'm not I don't

109
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:46,060
have I can't you you you can take my work and you can say he was a horror novelist and he maybe

110
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,140
he wasn't making as much money as he wanted on his horror novel so he wrote a horror novel and

111
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:56,500
called it real in other words you can just opt out if you want to with me if it was a scientist

112
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:04,420
with a big PhD and a lot of authority you couldn't opt out so with me it's take it or leave it you

113
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:11,580
can take it it's accurate the story is real and especially if it happened to you you're gonna be

114
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:19,180
able to you're gonna say wow this is deeply empowering to me and that's this is what they

115
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:25,340
wanted and I think that's why I ended up where I was Wow that's amazing so you were kind of chosen

116
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,580
I mean something that you've talked about as well as the great John von Neumann who is known for

117
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,100
being an absolute genius in his time smarter than all of the other incredibly smart scientists in

118
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:43,820
the US Hungarian and studied at a very you know actually notorious school in Hungary with along

119
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,940
with his colleague Jonathan Wigner and was just known as you know laid the mathematical foundations

120
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:55,220
for quantum mechanics a lot of modern computational principles he has said and you've cited he's

121
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:02,660
written a paper on the aliens possibly needing to be believed into existence and if they do exist

122
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:09,460
in some sort of parallel timeline or dimension that human consensus belief needs to shift into

123
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:17,020
kind of actually manifesting them and so you would be an incredibly important kind of first node of

124
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:23,840
creating that sort of belief well yeah and that has been the source of a lot of friction for me

125
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:31,480
in my life internal friction and friction with people on the inside who are aware of what you

126
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:39,200
just said now as far as this goes let's go back and let's explore von Neumann a little bit very

127
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,520
interesting he came up with he was involved in this I think that we're past the point of saying

128
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,680
oh these scientists who were supposedly in the majestic 12 group if that was even its real name

129
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,880
if that's all nonsense it's just sand Friedman made the whole thing up that's not true they were

130
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,680
involved a couple of data points to support you before you go on is Robert Sarebacher said

131
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,360
John von Neumann was directly involved right and von Neumann died of a really kind of gnarly form

132
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:17,680
of cancer and he had circuit secret service outside of the Naval Hospital that he that he was in

133
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,000
because they were afraid of what he might say that's exactly right yeah well you know I knew

134
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,640
Robert Sarebacher you knew Sarebacher oh absolutely no way Stan Friedman was a was a catalyst and he

135
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,960
introduced me to Robert Sarebacher and to other people you think Sarebacher was involved and then

136
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,920
we'll get back to yeah I knew Sarebacher was involved in fact I'll tell you a fairly weird

137
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,640
story here Stanton gave me Sarebacher's number and then he called me back and he said Sarebacher is

138
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,040
waiting for you to call him he's very eager to talk to you so I call Sarebacher Sarebacher

139
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:59,160
proceeds to tell me all kinds of detail about the materials that he was this was working on at the

140
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:08,680
Battelle Memorial Institute about how when when electron microscopes became operative he they

141
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:16,920
understood that there was a molecular grid a designed grid inside the inside this very thin

142
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,560
material and that was what made it so strong and I think that's probably been extrapolated out into

143
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:32,360
our military technology in many different ways and possibly civilian as well and he asked me I

144
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,600
narrated my experience to him this is before commune was even written how'd you meet him

145
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:46,240
through San Friedman okay so and I narrated it to him and he said I want you to write it all down

146
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,640
and send it to me so the next day I sat at my typewriter wrote the whole story out I put it

147
00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:00,280
in an envelope and we weren't near we were I was at my cabin in upstate New York and we were not

148
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:07,200
near FedEx but UPS had just started overnighting and so they were willing to come pick it up so I

149
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,640
called the UPS office and they came along and they picked it up to take it to Sarebacher the

150
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:21,880
next morning I get a call from the UPS guy on the scene saying we can't deliver it the recipient

151
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:32,520
has expired he's dead he died Sarebacher yeah that came to him the night he died but that

152
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:39,360
was after commune this must have been 80 no it was 86 I believe it was 86 yeah he died right

153
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,920
around then I thought he wrote to William Stein oh well it was it was while commune at that point

154
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,560
was being created and then I'm quite sure of that I'm quite sure of the day Wow that's Chris it was

155
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:58,840
very scary and I think it was related to your course I have no idea he was I was told later

156
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:07,240
that he fell off his boat and another UPS guy said he fell off his boat and the death certificate

157
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,580
says natural causes well the context around what was happening at this time is Sarebacher had just

158
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,580
written a letter to William Steinman who's another UFO researcher who was actually an

159
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:23,420
employee of skunkworks who got basically fired over his research around UFOs and he was saying

160
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:29,940
you know yes there was a program and von Neumann Vannevar Bush Oppenheimer were all involved and

161
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,020
he says these beings are like insects you know they're very lightweight and he talks about crafts

162
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:40,220
and stuff so maybe he was killed for you're running his mouth or something I don't know he

163
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,220
was head of Washington National Labs and David Grush has said on record that he set up UFO

164
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,580
secrecy in 1954 and I know he was very close with Thomas Townsend Brown who was a mid-century

165
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,820
anti-gravity who set up UFO secrecy of Sarebacher along with Oppenheimer well what's so fascinating

166
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,620
about that is Sarebacher would he talked about it very openly well that's the thing he was then I

167
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,860
didn't realize he died like that he was scrubbed from the internet there is nothing on Sarebacher

168
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:14,060
now all you can see is a little memorial from you know I think it's some Florida local magazine

169
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,780
I know other people who are deep inside who are like that who were extraordinary had extraordinary

170
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,700
lives and now you can barely find them on the internet like who well we're not gonna joke

171
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:32,180
on that let's keep talking about Sarebacher do you think well maybe and maybe maybe talking to me

172
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:38,660
was a mistake I was very frightened by it I'll tell you that and if you read communion you'll

173
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:43,300
see my references to this but I don't mention his name in communion because I was scared to

174
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:50,020
that was Sarebacher well Sarebacher's son has now gone on record saying my father told me that he

175
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:57,940
used to put cameras on you know modified versions of VT rockets in order to chase UFOs so sound has

176
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,580
a familiar ring he might have said that to me actually really I don't remember directly but

177
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,540
it does have a familiar ring well that was more and more is coming out about Sarebacher and Ross

178
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:13,220
Colthard has some interesting data points around some of the nuclear engineers old-timers that

179
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,260
he's met with in Australia knowing who Sarebacher was I think Sarebacher even taking a trip out

180
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:24,060
there because they had their Wumara nuclear test site right and so there being some correspondence

181
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,380
there and so that's fascinating you didn't realize when we when we did the documentary

182
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,860
with Rush last year I asked him there is one person that you can ask questions that can lay

183
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,860
out that can allow you to understand the architecture of the program who would it be and he said it was

184
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,460
Sarebacher how fascinating because Sarebacher spent a couple hours on the phone with me

185
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,580
so they knew they knew what was happening to me they had to have known or he wouldn't have done

186
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:56,140
that well when when Townsend Brown finally achieved a positive result with his anti-gravity

187
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:03,260
experiments this was in Paris he flies back to the US and Robert Sarebacher picks him up in his in

188
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:11,020
his big Cadillac and you know that's that's a noted by his daughter Linda and and and his historian

189
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,460
Paul Schatzkin and so I think you know he was he seemed deeply involved in all this stuff and he's

190
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:22,940
written big textbooks he was known for having you know an IQ of 200 plus and I think having

191
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,540
some correspondence with Sarebacher oh yeah yeah he was obviously extremely smart very quick

192
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:35,420
yeah and uh full of insight either way and uh really I think he did a lot of good that must

193
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,820
have been encouraging for you before community was made to just know that you were well the first

194
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:45,980
time I wrote it down was for him oh and the ups said we'll we'll send the thing back to you but

195
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,620
I never received it he's written a book too about ultra high frequency physics which is basically

196
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,100
if you think about what happens at ultra high frequencies that's the stuff that the National

197
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,140
Science Foundation is now quietly admitting unfortunately the necessary and only impetus

198
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,580
that will allow us to release suppressed science is kind of game theory vis-a-vis other countries

199
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,460
and national security but they're now releasing this overt model of extended electrodynamics

200
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,380
which you could say people like Sarebacher were probably looking into in the 50s because

201
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,580
these are sort of microwave microwave really extremely you know high up the the electromagnetic

202
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:28,460
scale you know uh very short wavelengths um that it may have all sorts of weird effects you know

203
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,900
and uh explain a lot of the biological effects as well when it comes to UFOs so well that's

204
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,940
very interesting I haven't kept up with that right I want to get let's get back though to

205
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,980
um von Neumann yeah because and parenthetically on the way back to von Neumann

206
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:54,460
uh he didn't tell me personally but he told a member of my family uh uh not von Neumann

207
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,740
uh general Exon if he had held when the debris and bodies were brought into

208
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:08,060
air material he had held one of the bodies and he said this is from the Roswell crash

209
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:15,900
yeah he had said he said it was like a big insect yes and that's certainly my impression of them

210
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:22,220
only they're not big I mean they're some of them are very small some of them are bigger but that

211
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:29,580
was that night when I woke up in that room my immediate thought was my god

212
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,100
bugs huge bugs and I thought that's why I thought I was having a nightmare because I came to this

213
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:43,980
with no idea it could happen now let's get back to von Neumann uh von Neumann there's two things is

214
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:51,260
the von Neumann machine which is he postulated a machine that would replicate

215
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:59,420
the species that built it and would then move around the galaxy looking for planets that it

216
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:09,500
could seed what if that's what we have here only von Neumann in in his I don't recall if it's

217
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:15,180
in very much detail in the writings he did about this but he does mention that something

218
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:21,660
like that over vast amounts of time would inevitably have a certain amount of deterioration

219
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:30,780
of its its uh memory what if what we have here is something that was programmed to

220
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:39,980
uh seed planets like this but not programmed to find someone else because they had as much

221
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,420
trouble as we're having finding other people and decided there weren't any and so it arrives it

222
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:52,940
finds us and doesn't know what to do and that's why we have this bizarre situation that if you

223
00:21:52,940 --> 00:22:00,460
look step back from the whole thing it could be it looks a little bit like an AI that has gone

224
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:06,940
berserk von Neumann the von Neumann machine could be an explanation for why this is so

225
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:13,180
peculiar let me put it that way but the other thing that von Neumann and you referenced briefly

226
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:20,780
this paper earlier there is supposedly a paper and general Exon who was no scientist but had

227
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:27,660
been exposed to a lot of scientists involved in this and was very smart it tried to explain this

228
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:35,740
to me and of all the scientists who were involved in it I thought he was most likely talking about

229
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,740
something that von Neumann would have thought of would have conceived there could have been

230
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:47,980
other scientists involved in it that I don't know about but the paper supposedly is just a

231
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:54,780
couple of pages long and it if it even still exists because a lot of this stuff was gone with

232
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:07,020
the wind I'm sure by now and what it postulates is that if this presence is not from this physical

233
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:16,940
universe or even if possibly even if it is in order to become part of our reality where

234
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:30,140
it does not exist in any way it has to gain a deeper within us we have to come to a deeper

235
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:37,820
realization of its reality it has to be as real for us as we are to each other as this is to

236
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:45,740
it's us as this is to us as our world is if it's not from our world it has to break

237
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:54,460
through into our reality by taking us not just to a level of belief in its presence

238
00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:00,300
but to an assumption about its presence that is as basic as our assumption about the rest of the

239
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,820
reality that we know fascinating how do we get our hands on that paper because we know on record

240
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,700
that von neumann I mean no scientist would dispute this he entertained this idea that

241
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,780
the mind is responsible for wave function collapse yeah that's exactly why I think he

242
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:23,500
wrote the paper precisely and he he explored that idea extensively and so it would be something he

243
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:29,580
would think of definitely and it is what he's talking about in the paper I would assume

244
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:36,140
is an intervention in the process of the collapse of wave function by this other

245
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:44,780
presence that alters the way the wave function function collapses when we perceive so fascinating

246
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:53,260
yeah now that would also explain and I take this extremely seriously because I think we're talking

247
00:24:53,260 --> 00:25:00,620
about something real you understand I respect this this belief I think this paper existed

248
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:06,460
maybe it still does and it's why when people are all angry about you know the government won't

249
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:13,260
disclose and so forth I say wait a minute and they say well we're ready and I say no we're not

250
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:20,140
we don't because you say we're ready for it but we don't know what it is that's right therefore

251
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,820
we are not ready and here's the problem I wrote a short story about this about von neumann's death

252
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:32,300
called the open doors about his fear that this is a door

253
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:43,020
which opens in the mind and in the perceptual system and can never be closed so once the door

254
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:49,900
is open once we have accepted them into our reality we can never get rid of them we can never tell

255
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:55,420
them no it turns out we don't want you here because we don't like you and we don't like what

256
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:03,580
you're doing to us we can't do that the door opens only once and only in one direction and forever

257
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:12,540
now if that isn't a motive to hide this to keep it secret people scorn the collins leaf they say

258
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,140
well they think it's demons and we're supposed to ignore demons and that's why they do

259
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:23,420
it might go a little deeper than that it might be that this is a time right now where we have

260
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:31,980
to be very careful about preserving our dominion of our reality and to think of this in some new

261
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:39,100
ways what do we do right now if we are going to let them into our reality and I think ultimately

262
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:50,780
we have to but on our terms they cannot come into and take our reality with we must not lose

263
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:55,180
dominion this is what my new book is basically about and I don't want to I'm not flacking my

264
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:00,860
book here but it does it has come up well how do we maintain sovereignty while letting them in

265
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:09,980
because we have to understand their motives and their functionality their physical functionality

266
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:17,580
their motives their understanding of themselves and we have to even if it's not necessarily a

267
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:25,500
completely correct conclusion factually we have to come to a decision about what we want them to be

268
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:34,540
in our reality and this has got to be a decision that is so deep that it is below the level of

269
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:41,100
ordinary discourse in a deeper level of consciousness which is the level of consciousness

270
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:48,700
which von neumann was talking about when he was talking about the way perception collapses the

271
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:59,420
wave function it's at that point that we control this fascinating that's right yeah I mean so this

272
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:06,140
brings this interesting question up philosophically of like we all three of us probably at this table

273
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:13,340
like are somewhat more pro the re-enchantment of the world or anti kind of materialist reductionism

274
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:18,300
this idea that you know everything's kind of happening randomly and lacks meaning but once

275
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:24,620
you kind of let that in your life the idea that you know maybe there is a hierarchy of being maybe

276
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:30,140
humans aren't at the top of it maybe things are way more magical than they seem it is a pandora's

277
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:36,540
box and the farther and deeper you get kind of ontologically you know as far as kind of chasing

278
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:43,980
truth the more evil you have to face and fight as well and so how do you ensure that human

279
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:50,300
consciousness raises kind of commensurately with our you know unveiling you know epistemologically

280
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,860
well that gets me to a story of something that happened to me in the 1970s

281
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:03,340
before any of this was in my life but that was other people already knew it would be apparently

282
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:08,140
I went but my wife was a very social person and she had lots of friends in New York

283
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:13,660
and we went to a lot of parties I was even invited to some of the parties but told

284
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:18,780
don't be depressing or I'll throw you out and you'll have to go them all in any case

285
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,420
at this party there was this lady who wanted to sit with me and talk with me she said Mr

286
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:30,700
Whitley she talked with an accent let's sit down over here and we sat down and she said

287
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:40,940
I want to tell you my story my story is this I was working I was doing the magical working she said

288
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:50,940
in a shtetl in Poland in the 1930s and we pushed away the dark side we had made extraordinary

289
00:29:50,940 --> 00:30:03,340
progress in animating a glam but we absolutely walled off the dark side which kept trying to

290
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:12,620
enter our working in different ways suddenly across the river there burst tanks

291
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:23,180
with its men in them in black uniforms with death's heads on their on their caps and we realized

292
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:33,420
that we had forced the dark side to come in on its own and it had broken down the door

293
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:45,420
this woman walked from Poland to China over the next six years and there was still an American

294
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:54,060
presence in China when she arrived and General Stillwell got her to the United States where she

295
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:05,020
rejoined the same community that she was in in Poland which had moved to United States

296
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:13,100
it is terribly important that we understand what the dark side is and not say it's demons and we

297
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,900
don't want it we push it away we have to understand that it's the wellspring of knowledge

298
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:28,300
and we have to we have to take care with it I mean you you don't you do not dance with the tiger

299
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:35,260
but you respect the tiger's presence in the world so how do you do that because you've said on record

300
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,300
many times you think you are where you are as far as your worldview because your curiosity

301
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:45,580
trumps your fear it does I know that for sure on the one hand you have all these myths like

302
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,860
you know the philosopher's stone or the holy grail or you know you're seeking truth and you find it

303
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:56,460
and you realize it's within or something and the outer is the inner you know the uh uh Siddhartha

304
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,620
you know you have all these stories like that kind of hero's journey and then you also have stories

305
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:06,860
like Faust and Prometheus of going for the forbidden truth for for the knowledge and then

306
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:14,300
getting burned and so how do you toe that line well the first thing we have to do is to understand

307
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:26,060
that all of us contain Faust all of us are Prometheus and we always will be that's called

308
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:35,180
being human and the best way to do this is to fully embrace in our deepest hearts the honest

309
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:42,380
truth about our humanity its dark side and its light side we all want to be good people

310
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:50,380
but that's not all we are not one of us that's not our nature our nature is to

311
00:32:52,220 --> 00:33:01,740
a nature is to be sentimental about the good but enjoy the bad and the dark and that is it look

312
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:07,820
the whole the whole expression of rock and roll is about that it is an incredibly important

313
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:13,420
expression a new kind of expression of the human spirit so i love it so much although i don't have

314
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:18,540
the ears for it anymore unfortunately i have to ear plugs when i go to concerts i hate it who's

315
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,780
your favorite i'm not going to get into that i don't i don't want to go down to the rock and

316
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:28,380
roll road you'll be here doing that all day and your your your your fans will sing why is

317
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,220
you talking about rock and roll for two hours come on they want to know the real Whitley

318
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,380
well no the real Whitley is actually also a huge classical music fan and an opera fan

319
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,780
okay so i'm a real culture vulture on many different levels amazing yeah what do you

320
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:47,180
think speaking of the dark side you obviously experienced this famous you know abduction if

321
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:53,820
you will in 1985 prior to that you had a very interesting childhood and you hint at possibly

322
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:59,020
having undergone secret experiments you grew up next to Randolph air force base oh yeah well

323
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:06,540
something happened i i know let's go back to that in i mean let's go back there in time i'm not

324
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:12,140
saying let's return to it later i'm sorry here's what happened as far as i can put it together

325
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:17,580
first of all i was seven years old when this happened so therefore my memories of it are

326
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:25,100
very confused and very sparse but i have a very close friend who grew we grew up together in

327
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,380
texas and like a lot of texas families our family connection probably goes back to before the civil

328
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:38,220
war family friendships and the south are quite common and we're still closest friends he's my

329
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:44,620
closest friend in the world he is very high up in this world in a completely different area from

330
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:51,980
anything remotely connected is it science or is it no it's it's another another area

331
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:59,100
it's something to do with government interesting and but we are you know we we spend every new

332
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,660
years together i'll be with him enough and his wife in a few weeks and every week and a half

333
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:11,340
he was also recruited and when i told him the story he's known all of he's read all my books

334
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:19,340
and manuscripts he knows all the story backwards and forwards and you'd laugh if you saw how very

335
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,780
different his place in the world is from mine and we keep our friendship secret i'm not going to

336
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:30,300
don't bother or probe about it because i won't i won't go there because we have to not because

337
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:37,660
we want to because we have to so in any case he remembers he was nine and i was seven i don't

338
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:44,540
remember anything about that recruiting me he was recruited and he was in the living room when

339
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,500
the air force people came and they knew them we knew a lot of air force but i'm sure my parents

340
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:56,220
knew them too and they said to the parents that it was an accelerated learning program with

341
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,420
for children with very very high iqs and there would only be three or four children in the program

342
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:09,500
in san antonio but the implication was was nationwide and maybe i'm saying a little more

343
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:17,020
than he said but that was this is i think it's logical extrapolation and they asked about the

344
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:23,980
program and he remembers them saying that it involved the use of a skinner box which i would

345
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:31,820
assume my parents had no idea what that was but his parents did know and they said no this was a

346
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:38,220
box that a person was put in so the real for the context for the audience the bf skinner was a

347
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:45,500
mid-century psychologist that worked on kind of behavioral conditioning so you know how do you

348
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,940
honestly often manipulate biological systems to like do certain things over and over you

349
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,980
ring a bell or what it's kind of like avlov's dog sort of thing yeah well it was repetitive learning

350
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,380
is what it was trapped in a room in the little box with a repetitive learning all i remember is

351
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:08,620
a dark place i couldn't get out of and noise horrible noise i don't remember any repetitive

352
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:17,900
learning that's all i remember in any case come october this started in august of 1952

353
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:25,900
come october i began to get sick constant i couldn't i was getting one cold and so my mother

354
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:32,140
takes me to the doctor it turns out i have no immune system it's broken gone it's broken down

355
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:39,420
so they take me out of the program i don't even remember any of this i was told this i didn't i

356
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,060
wasn't told my mother never told me anything about the program but i surmise i was taken out of it

357
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:49,660
because the next thing i do remember very vividly is i end up at brig general hospital a little

358
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:56,220
seven-year-old thin little seven-year-old boys being in an isolated in a room and given gamma

359
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:02,380
globulin shots and by these doctors who you know these huge needles i mean this is the early 50s

360
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:08,700
right needles are like gigantic and these huge needles are coming at me and they would get so

361
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:13,580
nervous the needle would go through my arm and the stuff would drip down my chest

362
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:24,380
it was just awful and then after a few days i'm taken home i can't see anybody i'm fed separately

363
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:35,820
i'm i can't i'm isolated until after christmas i go back to school finally in january my mother

364
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:42,220
kept my report card it said absent due to illness absent due to illness semester

365
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:50,060
month after month all of her life and we found it in their personal effects after she passed

366
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:58,060
and i said to my sister i want that report and she said sure i'll give it to you she destroyed

367
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:05,900
it instead and i said why did you do that i wanted them and she wouldn't say anything

368
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:10,540
about it she said quickly i just did it what does your instinct tell you on

369
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:17,500
what the skinner box and these experiments were for were they to make you a high performer no

370
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:26,140
they were to crack the cosmic egg i think so kind of liberate the soul from the body and

371
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:30,940
light astral travel or no because the visitors showed up a couple of years later

372
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:37,980
or right then maybe right even then and i think that that's the was the purpose to and i think

373
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:44,940
that to make you a receptor yeah i think that this started now i'll tell you what i have surmised and

374
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:54,300
i can't prove this i think it started at dachau i think it started in the camps and i think that

375
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:02,300
children who were being gassed sometimes after the gassing they weren't there anymore everyone

376
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:08,140
you know the people would all rush into the center of the thing and try to go up because the gas was

377
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:14,700
low and they would die in these pyramids of humanity uh all of them clawing for the ceiling

378
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:21,420
and the children would always be at the bottom crushed flat like bugs and um

379
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:29,580
um sometimes you know the the nazis kept extremely careful records and sometimes i suspect

380
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:37,660
some of those children weren't there and that noise i remember from those box that box i think

381
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:45,100
that's the sound a recorded of the screaming from inside the they were trying to duplicate the

382
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:53,100
conditions of the gas chamber to see if they could induce this power in another in in highly

383
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:59,500
intelligent what's the so the kids weren't there after i don't know they disappeared they went into

384
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:05,340
another reality so i know you've worked with peter lavenda yes he wrote a book called unholy alliance

385
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:10,780
right it's getting into really speculative territory that i i don't i don't personally

386
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,100
feel high conviction in but i'm curious to get your take on which is that you know the nazis

387
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:21,020
somehow allied themselves with an unholy force of non-human intelligence i don't even want to go

388
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,980
down that path i don't feel a level of conviction about it either i think the nazis were just shits

389
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:31,980
but lavenda also helped you uncover that some of these experiments might have been post operation

390
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:38,140
paperclip secret nazi experiments of some of these germans coming over a lot of the operation paperclip

391
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:44,780
people apparently lived in my neighborhood yep and my father was on a big house on the hill and

392
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:50,300
then across the street a couple houses down is an fbi agent and his wife and then the street over

393
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:58,220
there's these scientists so god knows what that's all about right no idea and then i'm going out to

394
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:08,460
randolph every thursday night for um for these things and uh and then that ends and you know i

395
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,340
sort of go back to living a normal kid life i have a wonderful childhood it's almost that made me

396
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:19,340
think is there something about inducing such a high state of human suffering that opens a crack

397
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:25,980
in the same way that an immense amount of love and like focused intention can also open you know

398
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:31,900
cracks open something and in our fields that allows you know someone who's thinking of you

399
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,780
with a lot of love allows you to maybe feel that yeah i think you might be on the right track

400
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,980
i think that's exactly what it was about and even when i think about idea of angels and demons

401
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:49,340
for one force is like exploiting human potential and humanity to like them the most that they can

402
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:54,940
and then the other forces there's like a levitate like a they're trying to levitate levitate or

403
00:42:54,940 --> 00:43:02,620
or elevate the the the just the way we think and the way we act and uh maybe the extremes do

404
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:07,980
do something to our reality that then brings in things today i want to share something that's

405
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:13,980

to mando for sponsoring today's episode of american algorithm well i started to have

436
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:21,820
weird experiences in my childhood after this and uh i had a normal childhood and the weird

437
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:28,540
experiences were very compartmentalized i remember an incident two incidents i remember an incident

438
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:34,620
of my father taking me out to the country house and in the middle of the night it was cold so

439
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:43,660
it must have been the winter and um this strange car showed up with these glowing lights that

440
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:49,580
didn't shine and came rushing down the road and stopped in front of the house very abruptly like

441
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:56,380
it was not a normal car and then the next thing i knew this object that was squared off came tumbling

442
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:02,620
across the sky and went into the back pasture behind the house and it was back there glowing

443
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:09,500
and i tried to talk to my dad and he was just standing there he wouldn't he couldn't move or

444
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:16,860
didn't move her and then i felt like i needed to go find out what was going on and i went out toward

445
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:22,140
the back pasture and that's all i remember and then the other incident was very weird

446
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:30,060
suddenly one afternoon my mother and father gathered up my then baby brother and my sister

447
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:35,980
and they all went to the country house leaving me at home with my dog alone at an age of 11

448
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,460
without ex you know mother said well just call us if you need anything

449
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:47,980
you know yeah i needed a lot of things like a dinner and you know a life and

450
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:56,540
you know not being left in the house alone in a scary night by myself yeah so after a while i

451
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:01,500
eventually i mean i made a dinner probably peanut butter sandwich or something

452
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:08,460
and i went to watch the little tv and then went up to bed to find i had an air conditioner this is

453
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,660
house was too old to have been centrally air-conditioned and there was a window

454
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:19,340
air conditioner that looked out on a window and there was a lower roof behind that beyond that

455
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:29,420
window and the window above the sash above the air conditioner was sealed and it had been pulled

456
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:36,780
down and the seal was all hanging loose and i could see it was obvious that it was just

457
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:44,620
little past dusk there was someone on the roof and so i went down and called the country house

458
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,620
and my mother answered and she said well if there's someone on the roof telephone the police

459
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:56,780
does you see how strange this all is yeah she didn't come rushing home exactly or why did they

460
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:03,420
go in the first place so your dad must have had some involvement and i mean he must have so we do

461
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:08,540
you must have speculated you know if he was this high ranking army officer who he probably had

462
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:15,340
clearances right i don't know i know he listen he would tell you mother said well he found

463
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:28,620
apartments for uh or uh gi uh uh the wives of gis who were abroad and then he if you asked him

464
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:34,060
what he did during the war he said well i just used to pick up cigarette butts at fort sam used

465
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:40,780
to keep the keep the place clean and so you know i have no idea what he did you're pretty sure

466
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:45,980
that's not true i have a feeling somehow i didn't pick up cigarette butts yeah yeah

467
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:51,820
and and what was his name his first is carl streber k a r l okay and um

468
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:59,740
so but getting back to this uh the the um

469
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:08,860
i went downstairs to call the police but i you know there's no 9-eleven in those days i didn't

470
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:15,100
know how i called so i'm got the phone book there's a man in the house upstairs get coming

471
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:19,900
to the house in any moment and i'm looking in the front of the phone book for the local the

472
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:28,700
tarot hills the local police i finally find the number i call and the lady answers and you know

473
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:34,380
we only had like three cops it was a small community a bedroom suburb of san antonio but

474
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:43,580
an independent city save on taxes and uh a cop comes i know the cop i know all the cops

475
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:50,780
all the kids do it's not you know it's a very small scale deal he he parks it down at the front of

476
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:58,380
the half it's a half acre front lawn with big huge hedge like 60 feet tall augustum hedge

477
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:05,820
and a bower kind of it and he comes through and i see him coming out coming up out of the shadows

478
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:10,700
and he's got his gun out like this he's coming to the house with his gun in his hands

479
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,420
and it scared the hell out of me you know what did he know that i didn't know

480
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:23,420
and so he comes in the house and i say he's up on the roof and he goes running upstairs

481
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,820
seconds later he comes running down just yelling there's no one there

482
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,980
there's no one there he runs down into his car gets in it and drives off

483
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:43,900
that was it then what happens to me i actually don't know the rest of the night i don't remember

484
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:50,060
a thing about it i remember my parents and my sister coming home the next morning it was a

485
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:55,420
beautiful morning i came home about 11 o'clock 12 o'clock before noon because i had a lunch with

486
00:51:55,420 --> 00:52:02,540
them i'd made my own breakfast i remember that that's the story and you're still in communication

487
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:11,180
with the nhi is that right as of today yes it's part of my it's a it's my life non-human

488
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:18,620
intelligence i am in communication with something do they manifest themselves as grays for you or

489
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:29,740
still no not often once in a coon's age i about a year ago i'm pleading i want you to a come in

490
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:34,940
front of the cameras i've got two different camera systems in the house i've been i've

491
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:41,260
been trying to get pictures of them since the 80s do you have any no i do i have very little stuff

492
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:50,300
a few things they got pissed off at me a couple of years ago and they all these

493
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:58,220
explosions strange explosions got picked up as a result of that and on the cameras and i've got

494
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:05,820
that and they like me to wake up at three o'clock in the morning to immune i guess yeah and uh

495
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:13,500
i know is it at a specific time well it's an hour according if it's if i'm right about what it is

496
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:19,900
there's a an ancient yogic tradition of brahman muhurtha time the time you're looking at in your

497
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:25,020
head yeah yeah because in islam it's also you there's like a in a lot of religions that time

498
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:32,780
is is is like very sacred you do commune with god like the highest the the highest um yeah in

499
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:37,580
islam the prayer that you do around that time is the one where where you're supposedly closest

500
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:43,180
to god and i think it has something to do with actually like uh having done to joe dispense a

501
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:48,540
retreat he there's a whole thing around like a melatonin being uh there's something mystical

502
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:55,180
about that we still don't understand about how melatonin makes the uh makes the brand makes the

503
00:53:55,180 --> 00:54:00,940
brain act when we're asleep and that's why some of his meditation you'd make you wake up during

504
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:07,580
that time well i wake up during that time every night every every single night and in fact for

505
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:14,540
years after my wife passed away back in the 90s well what is between three and four or well it's

506
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:20,300
supposed you know the interesting thing was that it is supposed to be an hour and a half or an hour

507
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:27,980
and 30 minutes before dawn and so that's why i you know at first they would wake me up physically

508
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:34,700
they would blow in my face i would get a little kiss um i wrote a poem i have a book of poems

509
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:41,900
out called the hidden garden which uh has been read by i think 12 people and another 14 people

510
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:47,180
listen to the audiobook but you know poetry is not go out and check out whitley's poetry come on

511
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:53,100
yeah do it folks they do check out it's nice anyway i wrote a poem about this experience and

512
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:59,580
and uh and it was not an unpleasant experience you know you get to the point where you have to

513
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:06,060
learn something about sleep healthy sleep you're going to go crazy getting waked up at that hour

514
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:16,380
every night and you know they do not they do not stop uh so after she passes back in the 90s

515
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:20,380
there was a period of time where they're waking me up at that hour

516
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:30,300
then we lost the cabin we leave the cabin uh and that doesn't happen then she gets ill

517
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:37,900
and she passes on and a few days after she passes on it starts again they start waking me up at

518
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:47,260
three o'clock around that time and it becomes a very big part of my life very important because

519
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:53,660
i can feel the communing going on i can feel it really intensely and part of it is involved

520
00:55:53,660 --> 00:56:00,780
seems to be involved with my wife and other dead people and the dead and the aliens it kind of all

521
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:05,020
do you think you know we talk about the communion of the saints in christianity

522
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:11,500
do you think that it's somewhat similar where where you're commuting with feels incredibly

523
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:19,100
sacred it's something i would not every once in a while i don't do it because what happened

524
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:27,660
at first for the first five years from 19 2015 until 2020 they woke me up religiously every

525
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:33,020
night then they began to not necessarily wake me up every night but i was expected to wake myself

526
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:38,300
up and i found that out the hard way as i decided well they're not waking me up so i can sleep all

527
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:46,620
night that wasn't the idea do you get any messages from them oh god i've written all my books since

528
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:53,340
2015 have been written based on this what are some what are some big recurring themes as far as

529
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:59,020
messages you're supposed to get out to humanity from them

530
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:09,100
well if you look across the books what you see are two things one is we are more than physical

531
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:20,300
creatures and two is we have value more value than we ourselves recognize we are very very valuable

532
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:30,700
very very valuable and extraordinary beings we're not the lesser we are our own in our own way we

533
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:36,540
are another masterpiece of the universe and you can see that that's the arc if there's any arc

534
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:41,500
and that in those books that's the arc and it comes up very strongly in the new book which

535
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:48,540
is basically about empowerment do you because i've read your book on jesus actually it did

536
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:52,780
yeah yeah yeah oh thank you yeah of course i thought it was great and it definitely has like

537
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:59,420
gnostic underpinnings around your view of jesus that he uh ascended to you know in traditional

538
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:07,100
christianity he he was the son of god he was also godlike but i think you view him as possibly one

539
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:14,220
of many and so going to your point about humans generically speaking being more special or more

540
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:20,700
godlike is that would that be your sort of worldview that we're capable of coming to deity

541
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:30,460
that because we are we're not like the angels and the perhaps the demons uh we don't have to be

542
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:41,020
anything we can take a journey we have that freedom to take a journey and the grays do not

543
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:49,180
have that freedom they know too much to have that kind of freedom but we they see too far ahead in

544
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:55,260
time and too far back in time too clearly to really have free will they don't have free will

545
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:01,260
that's interesting so you're like if they're because i remember one part of communion it's

546
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:07,820
like this kind of joke but it's twisted and it's so visceral and and the the the being says uh soon

547
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:13,740
my dear you'll you'll be one of us or something just like us yeah and so it's like they're they're

548
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:19,660
almost they've moved so far down this path that they've hit this sort of cul-de-sac and so they

549
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:25,100
know too much and they're trying to come back to warn us to inflect in some sort of more godly way

550
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:32,700
or something and to also enjoy communing with us because when they are in communion with you they

551
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:38,140
are experiencing time the same way you do everything is new how do you discern between

552
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:44,380
good and bad in that scenario where if you do think that this is some sort of parallel or alternate

553
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:51,020
timeline what if it's bad entities and they're trying to ensure that their own sustenance and

554
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:57,260
through trickery and deception you have to you have to be your own best best

555
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:06,140
counsel your own wisest counsel you have to live a good life a kindness and not lying are two very

556
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:12,620
important things of course we all lie and we're all unkind and everyone sees says that he's we say

557
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:17,740
that and they immediately go to all the things they did all the unkind things they did and all

558
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:24,780
the lies they've told and so do i the same thing but we have these choices if human beings can make

559
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:31,340
choices that they can't make it's too late for the grace they know too much they can't make choices

560
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:36,300
do you think they do exist on some sort of timeline or something happen like the classic

561
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:41,900
speculation about the grace would be like they are the victims of some sort of nuclear holocaust or

562
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:47,020
cataclysm cataclysm they've lost the melanin in their skin because the atmosphere is sort of you

563
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:53,420
know blocking the sun you know due to due to nuclear debris or whatever do you believe that

564
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:57,260
or or any sort of specific version of who they are where they're coming from

565
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:10,220
well i know now that we have bodies here that we have biologists have studied here and that those

566
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:15,580
studies are ended i don't know if they i hope they still have the bodies because you know they those

567
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:20,540
studies were never released and they're done in secret and there's probably a lot of biology still

568
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:27,020
to be done on those bodies if they would ever be brought out into the public space in science which

569
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:35,980
would be wonderful but so we have bodies but but i'll tell you a few things about these bodies one

570
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:47,180
is they are a mix of biology and not exactly machinery that's too putting it too far but they

571
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:56,380
they they um like biological replicas of some sort they're like something somebody built

572
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:06,540
somebody with a certain amount of skill in in in genetics built these but not not unlimited skill

573
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:13,100
because they're not uh all that you know there's things about them that don't work very well yeah

574
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:19,500
i mean and then i also thought that like if you're gonna if you're gonna engineer a being

575
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:26,300
that kind of looks like like it's very grail small like well you you you get back to the hybrids

576
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:36,460
which are they are they are engineered and they are very fluently telepathic but they are also

577
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:45,340
unvoiced and they are extremely autistic and if you go online and spotify or apple

578
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:51,740
podcasts or somewhere you can find a a podcast called the telepathy tapes thinking over by storm

579
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:56,860
right now yeah it's amazing i just interviewed kai and dr powell actually oh you did i'm going

580
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:04,220
to interview kai in a few a few days actually amazing i discovered this in the second i discovered

581
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:11,740
it i realized how important it was i'm glad it's come up but these people are unvoiced and autistic

582
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:23,420
yes now i have friends who are telepathic and are not unvoiced and i think there may be some people in

583
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:30,620
working with the in the ic and probably other intelligent communities around the world who are

584
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:37,820
telepathic and not un and not and voiced yeah but in any case uh one of the my friends who's

585
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:46,060
telepathic recently had a contact with an unvoiced person who was shocked because she

586
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:53,420
she he wasn't used to having a you know another telepath around and he and she had to really calm

587
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:59,100
him down they were but uh and said don't worry about it i'm i'm not going to do anything i'm

588
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:05,580
just here you know i can't help it either so um but i kai is a lovely person yeah she's awesome

589
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:10,380
yeah and i think really in this for the right reasons and uh for context for the audience

590
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:15,900
the number four podcast in the country right now which is absolutely wild kai dickens is this

591
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,060
amazing filmmaker she was rejected by all these you know production houses as far as making this

592
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:25,660
into a you know larger documentary and just kind of diy style recorded this it's she's found all

593
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:30,300
these non-verbal autistic children who were formally being studied by this harvard

594
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:38,300
neuroscientist a woman named dr diane powell and it's really remarkable you have these kids being

595
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:44,460
put in you know their parents are put in one room kid is put in the other room the parent sees a

596
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:50,380
random image generated on ipad or tv or whatever out of you know a thousand or ten thousand images

597
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:58,540
and the kid guesses what their parent is looking at with almost 100 accuracy 95 plus accuracy

598
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:03,740
and so it's it moves because all of these studies in the parapsychology world of mind never matter

599
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:08,860
or whatever have traditionally been super weak you need extremely large amounts of data and cohorts

600
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:12,940
and you end up in these endless arguments because people are too lazy to actually look at the data

601
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:19,580
right and in this case you have conclusive data and all these kids are spiritually while

602
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:24,460
physically they're you know non-verbal they're seen as totally maladjusted you know whatever

603
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:30,140
spiritually they seem far more evolved than all of us they meet up on the hill together

604
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:34,220
and they hang out and they talk about god constantly in the kingdom of heaven

605
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:39,980
and they seem to have faith in some sort of higher world that that we all just they do

606
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:46,300
have limited access to and kindness and truth-telling are essential in that

607
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:50,300
and they're savants they know everything they know languages better than the Spanish teacher

608
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:55,500
without having learned it it's a it's absolutely amazing sorry they yeah they are and it's you know

609
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:02,940
it gets me to the hybrids who are i don't know i know a few of them and i are there some that

610
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:07,420
are functional are there aliens walking among us well okay here's the functionality issue

611
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:17,340
you the ones i know are not voiced which immediately makes them essentially profoundly

612
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:22,780
crippled in this society also they're non-verbal that's what i'm saying they're not they're non-voiced

613
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:28,700
they can't talk and they often have to use techniques this one called rpm to type right

614
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:33,020
what they feel but they they know they live in an article they don't do that i mean they're not

615
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:37,020
they're not in they're not interfacing with the world around them which is a huge problem i've

616
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:42,780
talked to kai about it we're going to get together and try to figure out can we help them because

617
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:52,620
they're very they're very autistic and they are fluently telepathic and you know i'm i'm telepathic

618
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:59,660
but passive telepathic another sense in the sense that if i'm around a telepath i can have telepathy

619
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:05,340
with them very easily and i will pick them if i'm near someone who's telepathic i'll pick it up right

620
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:11,660
away should we try to do like uh you think about a color oh no i can't i can't project it in other

621
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:17,580
words i can't read your mind in your mind but if someone who is telepathic was in the room we could

622
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:23,980
converse that's that's that that so i was walking in the grocery store the other day that i'm

623
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,460
lived fairly near some of them i think i don't know where they live exactly but i do see them

624
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:35,020
around and of course i pick it up immediately this woman was walking in in front of me and i hit i'm

625
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:42,220
i realized oh shit it's one of them and she goes oh yeah she runs looks around she's got a skateboard

626
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:49,500
and she starts to come after me with a skateboard and i think holy shit what if i'm going to be

627
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:55,660
beaten to death by one of the hybrids because she's scared of me and so she can't she wants

628
01:07:55,660 --> 01:08:00,620
to leave the store she wants to run out of the store but i'm in the doorway so she turns around

629
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:06,220
and runs off into the store and i think just calm down witty let her go i'm not going to

630
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:12,700
follow anything and so i just go and concentrate on what i'm looking for i do not put my mind on

631
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:18,940
her in any way i get my stuff and i go out and there's often somebody waiting another one will

632
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:24,460
waiting you know they have these old cars they're not having they don't have much money and so the

633
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:29,180
other one that's waiting outside is there and i come out and go into my car and he looks at me

634
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:35,820
and he goes like that and i know i'm good i've passed they're not going to be pissed off

635
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:44,380
but that's reality it's a reality and i'm sorry it's real it's real the telepathy is very real

636
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:50,300
do you think any of the hybrids are functional human beings that are walking around not that i

637
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:56,860
have met uh and and they also all smoke all the time and why do they do that well i i went to

638
01:08:56,860 --> 01:09:02,540
this into this very extensively i spoke to a psychiatrist who specializes in treating

639
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:10,700
schizophrenics and he really solved it for me he said schizophrenics smoke not to suppress the

640
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:23,500
voices in their heads but to smooth out the the nicotine smooths out the the uh emotions it it

641
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:33,500
calms you and the hybrids smoke all the time they never stop all the time and you know in this

642
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:40,220
society you know at santa monica is practically has a no smoking sign on the city on the boundaries

643
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:45,340
of the city i mean this is not a place where you smoke very comfortably anywhere and so you know

644
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:52,220
they're very isolated and they're very unhappy and they're not they're poor and i'm hoping and this

645
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:58,300
seems to me to be completely impossible i'm hoping that we will be able to reach out to them

646
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:06,940
in some way and bring them into society because we've got wonderful people human regular people

647
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:14,620
caring good people who can help them have you ever read the sci-fi novel childhoods end i certainly

648
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:21,820
have so in that book as you know there are the overlords these sort of cosmic hosts if you will

649
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:27,740
that are attempting to make contact with mankind right they do it through this cadre of telepathic

650
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:33,020
children and these telepathic children are sort of the paul reveres if you will of humanity

651
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:38,300
that are starting you know this this communications channel to this higher higher kind

652
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,780
of borg-like being what do you think of that do you think that's that that that's a case of fiction

653
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:49,420
becoming reality or he he was obviously a very extraordinary man he was arthur c clark was

654
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:56,860
fascinating fascinating man he's probably mi6 oh probably yeah he lived in sri lanka he he wrote

655
01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:01,420
a book about a portal in sri lanka on the top of a mountain and now it's you have to speculate that

656
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:05,980
he actually thought that there was one or something well of course he did i'm sure he did yeah i had

657
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:13,740
this strangest experience with him um i had a friend uh mike smith when i was living in london

658
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:19,820
he was also an american he was a very good artist and in those days the english were easily fooled

659
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:25,660
by fake credentials so he made some fake credentials for a paper called the chicago

660
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:31,100
citizen which didn't even exist and we used to use these credentials to get into places we

661
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:40,620
didn't belong like ask at opening day and the premiere of of uh which what is 2001 was space

662
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:47,580
odyssey yeah yeah arthur c clark's the movie the earth okay yeah arthur c clark sanly cubrick based

663
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:53,340
on actually a novel by arthur c clark called the sentinel right so arthur c clark is there i end

664
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:58,780
up sitting beside arthur c clark in the in the movie no way i'm telling you the truth that's crazy

665
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:03,740
and so you know i'm very quiet of course because i don't want to i don't want to get thrown out and

666
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:08,220
i don't think it'd be too long before another american's gonna understand realize that i'm

667
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:15,260
there based on complete bullshit and so so i'm sitting there you were meant to be there baby

668
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:20,540
and i asked afterwards he turns to me and he introduces himself as if he didn't know who he

669
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:25,900
was and i tell him my name and he said well why are you here and he said i said well i'm from the

670
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:35,260
chicago citizen the chicago citizen he says i said yeah it's a new paper oh he says well what do you

671
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:39,180
think you're going to write a review he says i said yes i'm going to write a review and i'm

672
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:44,700
in the review i'm going to say that you are a genius and he says well you better say stanley's

673
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:51,020
a genius too wow so that was my contact with arthur c clark both of those guys were truly

674
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:56,140
geniuses they were great geniuses and yeah god i have a feeling there's not too many places in

675
01:12:56,140 --> 01:13:03,020
the universe to create geniuses that are scot-free yeah in the world like we are

676
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:09,020
in moments like this i just often remember a specific interview that dr john mack did with

677
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:16,780
one of the one of the kids from the aerial school and he asks her why she thought the

678
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:24,220
visitors were there and she goes in space there is no love but down here there is and i i remember

679
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:29,980
so viscerally watching that for the first time and that resonating on such a deep soul level

680
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:34,220
that and and of course you can make the case that it's wishful faking of course i want to

681
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:38,220
feel special as a human and i want to feel like we have something here that doesn't exist elsewhere

682
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:43,180
in the universe but there is something so profound that anybody that has experienced like a

683
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:54,380
love and and a sense of yeah it's anyone that that just experienced love you can really

684
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:59,180
feel the transcendence of that i mean the most popular filmed for the past past decade was about

685
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:04,940
like transcendence of love interstellar so like the whole thing is about was it was about that so

686
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:10,780
and and it and you could see how like it's almost like uh it right now is the 10th it's the 10th

687
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:14,700
year anniversary and the people are talking back about the film because we're watching for the

688
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:19,980
first time big fans are watching again and and it and the convergence of even that i was talking

689
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:25,500
to jesse about a couple days ago it feels so every just everything feels like it's making sense for

690
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:32,460
the moment that we're living right now unlike uh in the way people are in the the drones popping

691
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:38,140
up on people's thinking more about space with space x landing you know a tower from coming

692
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:42,540
coming from space background to onto earth i really do think that we have something so

693
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:47,420
profound here that we have to preserve that we have to gather around to like as you said really

694
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:52,300
understand what is it that makes us who we are what it makes it what is it that makes us makes

695
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:58,940
them who they are and uh and so that they are here based on our terms we know that we're not

696
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:02,780
they're not going to be the overlords that we have to like that's exactly what we have to submit our

697
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:08,220
entire sovereignty to just because they're a higher form of intelligence 2025 is about figuring out

698
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:16,860
how to live together and that does not mean we are going to have to accept overlords if that's all

699
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:23,660
we can manage they don't want to be here maybe our current reality is more governed by entities

700
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:29,420
than we realize like where do thoughts even come from and so i do i think there's kind of this

701
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:34,700
perspective of like you know one of my favorite quotes is this eden phil potts uh the universe

702
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:39,740
is full of magical things waiting patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper now and um

703
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:45,420
that's a wonderful quote it's a wonderful quote and there's maybe some strata of beings that are

704
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:51,660
waiting for us to ascend in to their level to truly you know communicate at parity with them

705
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:56,460
and then there may be some other beings that if you're not aware of them probably have more

706
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:02,380
insidious control of your life right now yeah and so like it brings up all these sort of kind of

707
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:07,020
epistemic ontological questions when you're daydreaming why are you thinking what you're

708
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:10,940
thinking you're not consciously constructing those thoughts they're sort of entering your

709
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:16,540
mind as if it's this antenna receptacle and so then then you have to ask what's on the you know

710
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:21,020
sending end of that and you know well on that point i feel like we jumped straight into

711
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:26,540
the communication with dana chai but we're not we we missed we didn't talk about the implant

712
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:32,940
and the fact that there's something in your body that you uh believe is an implant i feel like

713
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:38,220
right here if you yeah can we see it you can touch it you can't i don't think you touch it if you

714
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:43,340
want to i feel like two years i can give you a ct scan of it if you want that is it weird if i

715
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:47,500
touch it is it oh it's fine doesn't matter it might be a little hot because it's been working

716
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:52,860
right here uh two three years ago if you had if you had told someone go ahead and touch it don't

717
01:16:52,860 --> 01:17:03,660
be scared here here it's right under my finger now oh my god yeah that is well can you touch it

718
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:08,460
i'll i'll come to you but i want to finish this point because if you like that's also the normal

719
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:15,260
tissue yeah no no i mean there's the ct scan a video of there's a video of the surgeon trying

720
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:20,700
to remove it and the thing fucking moving at its own like it's going down into my earlobe

721
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:23,900
yeah and it just like goes down and i remember watching that

722
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:26,700
i guess it went under but that's the hard part

723
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:34,300
it's actually moving now it went under uh it's on the run

724
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:41,740
okay yes because i could see it just bright as day and now it's uh i don't see it am i going to

725
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:47,020
have weird effects now that i know not at all listen it's been in this whole it's part of this

726
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:52,700
conversation it you know it's been it years gotten hot and cold hot and cold all through the

727
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:56,700
conversations the implant really yeah it's so you think it's how you communicate with the

728
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:02,140
beans no no it's it's i work with it in other words i can interrogate the implant while i'm

729
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:08,540
talking but you've had it was humans gave you the implements yeah and this is this is something

730
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:14,460
like men in black style we this is something we haven't touched on yet is the human level of

731
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:25,260
this and i can tell you a lot about the implant and a um and and what it does because i've learned

732
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:31,500
about this from i was taught this by a couple of people who came into the house but let me

733
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:38,940
just back up to the time it was put in somewhere in one of my books it says it was 1992 it was

734
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:47,820
put in that's a copy editing error it was may of 1989 and i was in bed in the cabin and and was

735
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:52,860
asleep at about 11 o'clock at night i was still reading it just about to go to sleep

736
01:18:54,780 --> 01:19:02,700
the cabin is looks out on the swimming pool in the back i had so much money then i really wish

737
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:11,180
i hadn't been destroyed what happened uh did you see beyond the mgm thing the part of that is

738
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:17,660
episode three it goes into south park slampooning me and all that oh they eating up i took and

739
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:22,460
eventually people people will buy a book from somebody who's controversial but they're not

740
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:26,860
gonna it's easier now but in those days when you had to go into a bookstore to buy a book

741
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:31,260
you're not gonna buy a book by somebody who's laughing stock and being laughed at

742
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:42,620
and it torpedoed my career wiped me out and i went on this long agonizing decline it ended with the

743
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:50,940
loss of the cabin and eventual bankruptcy and it was just a disaster so i'm sort of sort of knocking

744
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:56,620
along right now i don't have much money but you know i don't need much money and i'm i can't

745
01:19:57,580 --> 01:20:04,380
i don't trust the publishing industry not to get into bed with the defense department and i'm

746
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:08,620
well aware of the fact that there are people in the defense department who do not like me and do

747
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:14,780
not want my work out there why don't they like you ask them ask the collins elite why they're

748
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:19,340
scared of which they really don't like you the collins elites they do not they think i'm in

749
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:24,780
league with demons because they are simple people who are way behind them they're behind the eight

750
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:29,980
bowl and behind the times i want to get back to your implant but really quick with the consulate

751
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:34,780
this is this evangelical christian group that like is cited by luil azondo and other kind of

752
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:41,420
disclosure advocates as being anti-disclosure because they think this is all demonic and so

753
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:45,500
it can't be scientifically studied we shouldn't even look at it and a lot of them were actually

754
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:52,380
looking at the phenomenon and i think is a part of this program called stack five at right airfield

755
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:57,180
and then they came out of that study with the conclusion this is written about by nick redfern

756
01:20:57,180 --> 01:21:02,460
in his book final events that this is all demonic we shouldn't look at it we should look away but i

757
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:09,660
i've never heard the collins elite well characterized by anybody like who are they are they they're

758
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:15,580
still operational and like what do they what do they want to do i well they were early in the cia

759
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:21,660
right they were sort of no it was air force air force i know yeah okay and um i i don't want to

760
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:29,580
go down that path because um if you look at beyond and episode three and you see what happened to me

761
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:35,020
and what it did to my life and it's got something to do with them i'm convinced

762
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:42,540
and uh because they they there's a lot those intelligence community does way more social

763
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:48,300
engineering in this country than you can then it should or should even be legally allowed to do

764
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:54,140
the cia stays out of that because it's not allowed to propagandize the american people but i think

765
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:59,980
there's lots of workarounds with other alphabet agencies air force office special investigations

766
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:07,660
right and yeah and the connection between some important aspects of the of the old media and

767
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:14,060
those uh organizations is very profound absolutely very dangerous so it's 1989

768
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:18,860
okay yeah let's get back to the fun stuff i don't like to talk about that other stuff because

769
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:25,900
there's not a lot i can do about it and i have been beaten to death by them so and maybe i'll

770
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:30,860
just finish the point when you were touching the empire now people can accept that stories given

771
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:36,860
you know lou's uh lou alessandro's uh testimony and him even bringing it on on news nation and

772
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:41,100
talking about it but i feel like uh yeah probably the time you were telling people they have an

773
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:47,500
implant people probably thought you were just not because like well not really because actually

774
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:54,220
you had a video yeah well no initially anybody can if they were in this room and feel your ear

775
01:22:55,260 --> 01:23:01,100
i don't know what that is man i mean that is like not you can look at the video and uh it's in a

776
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:06,060
number of documentaries and somewhere on my website too my website's too big and i can't

777
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:13,500
honestly say where very easily but uh you see the doctor try to remove it you see says my wife sees

778
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:23,420
it she's right there she says it's a white disc because one like a little tiny white disc

779
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:32,380
that's it i mean i got i got a little piece of and the doctor doctor was such a cute sweet guy

780
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:43,740
but he didn't know anything about any of the implants and i i and it said to me from the

781
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:49,420
beginning you're not getting it removed you're not getting it removed then it's 1994 or six i

782
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:54,380
believe it was and we lost the cabin we're living in a little condo in san jose and we meet this guy

783
01:23:55,180 --> 01:24:01,980
and we talk and you know he's interested in community and stuff and i decide i'm going to

784
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:06,860
see if i can get around and and see because i'm very curious about i'd love to see this implant

785
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:14,300
it's not really working at that time it's not essential to me at all so i say to him by the way

786
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:21,740
i've got this little cyst and she bristles i said on my ear would you feel that he feels it says

787
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:26,060
yeah it's just a little cyst you want me to pull it off pop it off i said yeah i would

788
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:31,900
said sure come over to my office tomorrow morning at saturday morning at 10 and i'll do it

789
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:39,740
at home and says you know i'm sick and tired you you this is your chance we're going to have a big

790
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:49,980
fight unless you promise me absolutely on your honor never to try again i say okay i figured

791
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:54,860
i've got her i'm going to get the implant out take it to la and we're going to study it with

792
01:24:54,860 --> 01:25:00,060
roger lear and you know we finally figured out what this thing is so we go into the doctor's

793
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:06,940
office and he's got his nurse there and he's opens up the slit and he and there and there

794
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:14,540
ann's videotaping it she says it's a white disc and the doctor touches it with a scalpel or

795
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:22,140
something a probe of some kind and it goes down into my earlobe at that point and if you look

796
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:28,940
carefully at the video you can see it gets sort of still and it's real he's realizing he said later

797
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:37,740
that i realized i was trying to take out an alien implant and he says um well i gotta have

798
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:45,500
to take your whole ear off i'm pulling out whoa it was been two days past and the ear burns like

799
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:51,820
hell i think and my ears caught on fire and it goes up back under the skin to this place

800
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,820
do you have any sense of what it's made out of

801
01:25:56,060 --> 01:26:08,380
they got a sliver at the doctor's office he sent it to the lab in under ordinary circumstances

802
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:16,620
i receive a telephone call from dr william mallow the head of material science

803
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:23,580
at southwest research in san antonio which was founded by a family friend is that that's texas

804
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:28,940
a and m or now that's no it's not a and m no this is different okay this is a private foundation

805
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:37,740
founded by tom slick san antonio plan in back in the 50s and bill is his head of material science

806
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:44,300
and has been since the beginning of the foundation at that point and somehow or another it went to a

807
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:50,860
lab to a regular ordinary lab the doctor just sent it to a lab but i don't get he doesn't get a

808
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:57,100
report from the lab i get a call from bill mallow about it so that's gone from the lab

809
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:07,180
to southwest research which is 50 50 or 45 funded by the cia bill says i've got your

810
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:13,020
piece of your sliver of the implant and he says

811
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:30,300
it is a metal metallic base with febrile motion moving uh cilia coming off of it

812
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:37,660
and then the doctor calls me all excited because it's the uh lab tech has seen it and told him the

813
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:42,940
same thing and i guess the lab tech sent it to southwest for that reason because it was so

814
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:48,380
unusual a lot of these things are reported as moving under their own metabolism or containing

815
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:53,420
some sort of cilia i studied a lot of them with bill i mean bill and i became close friends and

816
01:27:53,500 --> 01:28:00,460
we studied lots of the ones that roger lear was producing from here in la from the surgeries he

817
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:07,260
did and we found one that was remarkable when it was in situ in the person's neck it was emitting

818
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:12,700
an a radio signal and i'll get to the radio signal in this in a minute you think that so yours it

819
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:17,420
doesn't know i can tell you about it can you measure the radio signal because i just interviewed bob

820
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:24,220
mcguire his girlfriend uh has an implant and he put like an rf detector over her head and can like

821
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:30,540
measure the frequency coming out and so do you do do you ever do things like that okay let's not

822
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:38,540
forget uh what i was just gonna say yeah uh but yeah here's what happened at one point it used

823
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:44,300
to in the old days when it turned on my ear would turn bright red it was very noticeable i'm gonna

824
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:51,900
hear a noise in my head it was trying to to reach to to communicate with me and failing and that's

825
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:57,260
why it was like that but i didn't know that at the time so i'm in bill's office we're talking

826
01:28:57,260 --> 01:29:03,260
about and suddenly he says your ear is turning bright red i said i hear it bill it's on he said

827
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:09,660
let's go we run across the campus to a signals acquisition lab we get in the lab i sit on a

828
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:17,740
stool in the middle in there got all this stuff going on and after about 10 minutes it's cold

829
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:25,660
now it turns off and the lab guys say we've got a signal but we can't tell you anything about it

830
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:35,980
because the lab's classified so i think shit i you know i say to bill i want to know the signal he

831
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:41,260
said well we'll send you some information of course they never do um then the piece of the

832
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:48,140
implant disappears from his office or is sent off to some other lab i mean i don't they were they

833
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:56,220
were about 60 they were not totally reliable let me put it that way for me they were not telling

834
01:29:56,220 --> 01:30:04,060
me everything by any means 20 plus years pass i'm doing a book signing in san antonio all of a

835
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:12,140
sudden two guys walk up they say we want you to know whitley i one of them says i was one of the

836
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:17,740
technicians who was who acquired the signal and it is the strangest signal we've ever acquired

837
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:25,260
and it's still under study and they turn around and walk out gone i never see them again i have

838
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:32,460
tried every kind of rf meter there is to get that pick up that signal i've had ham operators and

839
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:37,500
all kinds of people try to we can't pick up a signal you know what you should do use a quantum

840
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:43,500
interferometer i wonder if that's what they used at that lab i i don't know what they have in a

841
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:49,180
classified signals acquisition well the reason i say that is yeah maybe i don't know if i'm allowed

842
01:30:49,180 --> 01:31:01,020
to say this i don't know maybe we should change the subject so in 1989 in 1989 um this implant is

843
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:08,780
is put in your ear okay here's what happens i'm lying in bed i'm breathing the windows are open

844
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:14,060
it's a may night it's a very pleasant night so there's no air conditioning is on the windows

845
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:20,540
are open and just going to sleep and suddenly i hear the crunching of gravel in the driveway

846
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:27,500
okay i do not see any lights there's a big gate the place is pretty secure it's a shale driveway

847
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:35,020
so crunching grab tie that means tires and nothing else i think oh my god i have a shotgun

848
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:39,740
under the bed and a pistol in the side table i'm from texas and i'm going to be gunned up

849
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:49,340
at all times i mean just face it uh so uh i start to go for the i have a bank of switches on the

850
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:55,020
on the bedside that i can turn them all on at once and completely flood the whole area with

851
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:59,820
floodlights they're still on the cabin by the way that's all still there all i don't own the

852
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:05,020
cabin is owned by a wonderful family thank god and they let me come up so and bring friends

853
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:12,220
occasionally anyway i go for the switches but as i'm turning i see a woman standing at near the

854
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:17,020
foot of the bed she's already in the room and a man beside her and i hear a voice in the backyard

855
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:25,020
male voice go condition red and then they run forward and instead of going for the lights i

856
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:30,220
don't care about the lights anymore i'm going for the shotgun the next thing i know i'm lying on my

857
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:40,220
right side in the bed i cannot see i cannot move and powerful hand is pushing my head down into the

858
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:47,900
pillow in kind of wave motion and the woman's voice is speaking very gently and softly like

859
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:57,260
you know it's okay it's okay just relax and etc and so forth a moment after this happens the

860
01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:06,780
pressure is off i start to turn get out of the bed as i do that there's a big flash of light

861
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:14,300
crashing in the woods and i end up sitting on the bedside there's nobody in the room anymore

862
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:24,620
the leds on the arm system are still armed red so i grab the pistol i go around the whole house

863
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:29,420
even up in the attic in the basement everywhere looking for a point of entry and there isn't

864
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:33,660
i end up sitting on the bedside what the shit

865
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:41,900
and i knew all about lucid dreams and i could hardly believe that was a lucid dream it was too

866
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:48,380
lucid so finally i sort of lie in bed all night kind of like this you know waiting for the dawn

867
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:54,780
and i tell him the story and i said i just don't know what to make of it because there's no evidence

868
01:33:54,860 --> 01:34:01,660
whatsoever of this then i go out to get the paper which entails going out opening the door into the

869
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:08,620
garage turning off the alarm system which is still on and getting in the car opening the garage door

870
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:14,140
and driving down about a mile away to get the paper i love the paper i still i still read actual

871
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:22,300
physical papers in fact the times in the new york times and when i open the door into the garage

872
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:30,220
the garage door is wide open but it's alarmed it's part of the system and the switch is obviously

873
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:39,980
completely tripped and the leds are right there bright red and so i disarm it and i keep going

874
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:47,020
i get into the car and i'm starting to go down anyway to get them sort of on semi-automatic

875
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:53,260
pilot i'm just getting out of bed i haven't slept the car is full of static it's like you know

876
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:58,700
shocking my hands when i tried it as a steering wheel i think holy god the cars are kind of blow

877
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:04,860
up i jump out of the car and i go in i said and there's something's going on it was real

878
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:09,820
they someone came into the house and they didn't trip the alarm system and she says well

879
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:15,580
that i'd explain about the garage she said well call the guy i forgot his name the alarm guy so

880
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:24,140
i call him he comes over and he says there was a very strong magnetic field there and it's not my

881
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:30,060
equipment all i can do is it the field was still there he could he measured i saw him measuring

882
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:35,900
with a gauss meter it would gauss meter would go all just the needle would disappear he said all

883
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:42,220
i can do is replace my switches which he did and we tried to get some information off of the alarm

884
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:51,260
system's records but they were all garbled so a couple days later it hurt starts to hurt and i

885
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:56,700
realized i have this implant ann's fascinated she says listen let's see what it's there for i said

886
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:02,540
i want to get it taken out i'm going out to la to roger she says forget it you're not getting it

887
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:10,060
taken out i want to find out what it is what it does i said well it's tracking me she says nobody

888
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:16,140
cares that you go down to the get the newspaper nobody cares about anything you do you're

889
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:22,380
uninteresting i said well yeah i'm true i mean i don't i mean i'm not a criminal or anything so

890
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:30,620
i leave it in and it turns on every once in a while i was with a why do you think it turns on

891
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:34,300
what is it trying to communicate oh at the time i didn't know there was no connection what do you

892
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:42,780
think now now it turns on when at the 3 a.m. meeting and i go into this semi-meditative state

893
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:55,740
and um i um and it i can feel it turns on i and and i i interrogate it i say i'm writing on this

894
01:36:55,740 --> 01:37:02,620
i'm working on that it doesn't answer me in words but it answers me in all kinds of different ways

895
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:08,620
including synchronicities where i will ask it for something you know when it first started

896
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:14,620
sounds kind of awesome you know it's fabulous i would i i have to tell you it's like an upgraded

897
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:23,820
human exactly i that my wife was a very wise woman and i thank god she did not let me get that

898
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:29,980
taken out it's the best thing i have in my life right now but anyway and who do you have any

899
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:35,500
speculation on who the two people were that let me let me finish and i don't know who they were

900
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:39,820
but i do know some other people that are involved with this implant this is a very surprising and

901
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:50,620
fascinating story uh i'm um uh i have obviously got people in my life who are on the inside

902
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:57,100
and i'm going to respect their privacy i don't agree with their secrecy but i respect their

903
01:37:57,100 --> 01:38:01,420
privacy and you think they take a special interest in you they do definitely absolutely

904
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:05,980
they have for a long but a lot of them have known for a long time i'm getting back to all the way

905
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:12,460
back to dr web yeah they knew what was going on they know some of them still do anyway i think

906
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:17,340
sarbacher had interest in what you went was it was it was sarbacher i mean it was like it goes so

907
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:22,700
that organic or was that did you have an interest specifically in you oh specifically that's why you

908
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:29,660
asked sarbacher wanted me to write it all out oh wow yeah yeah something fascinating so yeah

909
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:36,620
so anyway this gentleman it's a wonderful gentleman you both know his name and i'm

910
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:42,700
not going to say it because he also has a horrible temper and now you know exactly you're thinking

911
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:48,700
you know who it is and i'm if you say his name i'm going to deny it plausible deniability okay

912
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:57,580
anyway i can look at your facial gestures anyway he wants me to get a ct scan of the implant

913
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:07,900
and i'm eager to do this of course i said well how am i going to do it he says i say because i

914
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:14,380
can't go to my doctor and say i want a ct scan of my ear for no apparent reason and he says well i'll

915
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:21,820
call him so i call the doc the doctor i he says and then he calls me back just make an appointment

916
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:27,660
with him i make an appointment with him and he's all excited he says it's all set up you just have

917
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:35,020
to go over the blood go to the get and they'll do a ct scan of your ear and i go over to the power

918
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:44,060
medical lab or wherever it was and they they're very confused a ct scan of your ear and then there's

919
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:50,060
a person who comes there who they don't know who wants to be there and there's a little confusion

920
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:58,620
and that's resolved finally and so they do it and i get it back and it's a wonderful i've got images

921
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:05,500
of it it's a wonderfully clear perfect scan and you see the thing clearly however two days before

922
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:14,860
this after i have agreed to do it someone somewhere got the idea apparently that i might

923
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:21,580
get it agreed to have it taken out because i'm sure that's where from the ct scan the next step

924
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:30,940
was going to be well we've got a ct scan we want to look at it now there is a certain knock on my

925
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:39,340
door which i am not going to duplicate it's immediately recognizable and it's unusual

926
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:46,460
i know this knock and it's come to me a few times both here in california and in other places

927
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:51,500
i know that when that happens i'm going to open the door and i'm going to have a conversation

928
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:59,260
with human beings with some people it happens i open the door two men are there one of whom i

929
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:05,980
have met a number of times one of whom i did not know who i suppose i always there's always a second

930
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:12,780
one there and i always think to myself he needs a guard for some reason is it because he's being

931
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:19,020
watched or because they're scared i'll go crazy or what is it but anyway they come in he proceeds

932
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:30,540
to explain to me how the implant works very nice man he explains that it that it can can pick up

933
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:39,180
and needed information and find it and draw me to it i said it's like synchronicities he says it's

934
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:44,780
not a synchronicity it's actually guiding you to where you need to go to get the information

935
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:50,060
and it's wonderful in that respect all i have to do is think of something i need what information

936
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:54,860
is anything anything i need anything you want anything i need when you read the new book you're

937
01:41:54,860 --> 01:42:00,380
going to see a lot of stuff about genetics and stuff in it that i have no idea about before i

938
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:04,220
started writing the book but it's all there now do you think the two people who implanted it were

939
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:10,300
human or non-human they looked like people that's all i know i cannot tell you anything else about

940
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:17,020
i don't know clearly there was no there was no surgery it was just like no there was no

941
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:22,620
yeah there was no surgery there it just went through the skin so if they were people they were

942
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:28,140
and end this business with this super high intensity free-floating magnetic field we

943
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:33,020
can't do that we can now but we couldn't then you know i wonder if these are the

944
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:38,300
the agents that tim taylor was talking about in that in his high dry beings or that if you

945
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:42,380
talk to like people like richard dolan you know he'll say like they're the men in black

946
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:49,100
phenomena is actually very real and that's like counterintelligence for the nhi for the aliens or

947
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:54,060
something there's something there's some kind of there's some kind of bleeding off there between

948
01:42:54,060 --> 01:43:00,860
the the presence yeah and the and us and it it's got something to do with the dod i'm sure

949
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:11,900
i'm sure it does but let's go back now to the incident to the two men coming into the apartment

950
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:17,500
this was a just a few years ago so they explained to me the man explains to me

951
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:26,300
that part of it and a few other things about how it works and then he says it was invented by a

952
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:31,660
man named constantin rodive and they leave and of course i immediately google the name

953
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:39,900
and i realize as i'm googling the name it's not rodive he mispronounces it's rhodovay

954
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:47,260
constantin rhodovay was an expert in electronic voice phenomena and electronic voice communication

955
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:55,420
with the dead no way with the dead with the dead so like it's a technological version of mediumship

956
01:43:55,420 --> 01:44:03,900
exactly it's technological mediumship and it's he said that he designed it am i wearing something

957
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:10,860
that was designed by someone who was dead and on the other side when he designed it or he did he

958
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:17,900
design it before he died i don't know when did he live he died in the 70s i think but there's

959
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:23,580
lots of on the internet about it but actually it's r-a-u-d-i-v-e have you tried to match up

960
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:28,940
his patents or pictures from his work too and does it look similar no i didn't i couldn't

961
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:34,460
find anything didn't find anything no but i did find this but that's fascinating that you describe

962
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:40,940
your your you know this heating up at night at this specific hour that's known historically

963
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:46,060
to be when you commune yeah and it's it's communion for you you're seeing that there's a there's a

964
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:51,820
there's a there's a structure here it's not random also the other thing the implant does

965
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:57,580
is opens up a slit in this eye really it's more in this eye now but it opens up a slit and you

966
01:44:57,580 --> 01:45:05,660
can see words racing through the slit too fast for you to read except occasionally and they all seem

967
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:11,020
to be kind of nonsense words i mean they're words they're english words for the most part but they're

968
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:17,980
not relevant to anything and i asked him about that and he said the man he said that's drawing

969
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:26,860
up material from your unconscious that's relevant to what you're doing what you're working on and

970
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:35,900
this is why when i'm writing i can remember incredible detail about all kinds of stuff

971
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:41,820
you've written 40 books yeah but this is this is recent this is after 2015 and i'm only written

972
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:48,700
about six books since then so the thing came on starting 2015 in 20 no it came on in 1989 and it

973
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:53,900
started working in oh it started activating in 2015 but there's let's keep going here but how

974
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:57,900
does this guy know this about how it works though how does the guy who knocks on your door come in

975
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:04,860
because he is obviously part of the same world we're sort of talking about that i think richard

976
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:11,100
dolan who is a lovely brilliant guy has got something i think there is a breakaway civilization

977
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:17,100
and we're talking about it right now interesting so breakaway human civilization that is systematically

978
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:24,220
in touch sure look human to me it's fascinating now then what happens is i start telling my

979
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:30,700
friends this story and i'm talking about it i tell one friend and he's asked me not to use his name

980
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:36,700
i've specifically asked him if i could who says well yeah oddly enough i've had a slit like that

981
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:44,060
in my eye uh for years i've often wondered and the words go through and you can't quite read them

982
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:51,900
i said you know i know what that is now and i explain it to him i said and he says well that's

983
01:46:51,900 --> 01:47:00,060
extraordinary because you know i he's written some books also but here's the weirdest thing he's one

984
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:07,260
of the world's leading experts on constantine rotevei no way yeah what yes what are the chances

985
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:14,300
that gave me no there's not chances it's an experiment it was been in him for longer than

986
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:23,500
mine has been in me yeah where's rotevei what where is he from he was from uh rumania or okay

987
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:30,620
lithuania or somewhere like that i don't recall off the off hand but there's a lot and this did

988
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:37,100
this guy live in your vicinity at all or is there you know any through line between you and him as

989
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:42,860
to like why he received this as well outside of i guess being connected to rotevei there might be

990
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:48,380
some kind of a through line i can't see it he lives up in uh up in marin county why do you think yours

991
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:55,660
activated in 2015 why the delay i'll tell you why i can tell you precisely and this was this is

992
01:47:55,660 --> 01:48:02,380
just stunning but it's all part of this and i'm you know we're dealing here with something that

993
01:48:02,380 --> 01:48:12,140
causes on a logical shock okay so let's just suck it up uh after annie passed away it began

994
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:17,820
is when it began to work and i began to notice the slit and i was walking across the street one day

995
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:25,180
and in bright sunlight the slit's very obvious you can see it and i'm i think to myself who are

996
01:48:25,180 --> 01:48:36,940
you and the words slow down and it says very clearly coming across it's me and whoa wow so your

997
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:43,820
wife when she passed on you think she activated this she activated it and i think that woman may

998
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:52,940
be new all along i do not and is a mystery wrapped in an enigma she is she is so yeah

999
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:57,020
let's go into that you know can i just say something on since i came up like i remember

1000
01:48:57,020 --> 01:49:03,660
the first thing i ever watched on you and communion i remember like after i prayed for her

1001
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:09,980
because i just i could feel how incredible of a soul she was and i prayed that i promised you this

1002
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:16,220
happened i prayed that one day i find love like like whitley's oh man you know when one of the

1003
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:20,460
visitors when i was in the abduction experience said to me you're the luckiest of the lucky i

1004
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:27,020
thought what crap and and then later i thought well i must be i written communion and now i'm

1005
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:33,740
a big name but that wasn't it it was her it was finding ann why and i'll tell you how i found

1006
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:40,700
how'd you find her well i was living in london and i like england i spent a lot of time there

1007
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:47,820
i came back to the states daddy got mad at me because i was supposed to go to the london school

1008
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:53,660
of economics and instead matriculated the london film school and a year later he found this out

1009
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:59,180
figured this out and got all pissed off and made me come home and so i'm back in the states and

1010
01:49:59,180 --> 01:50:07,180
i'm in new york and i'm trying to i want girls i mean i'm here on 23 or something

1011
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:11,420
and i want a girlfriend and i had girls in you in london now i don't have any girls

1012
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:17,020
so i go to singles bars and i've gotten a job dad said well if you're on your own now you've

1013
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:24,380
got to find your work do your thing and don't come back to san antonio do your thing and so

1014
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:30,780
uh i um got a job as a media planner in an advertising bentman bowls advertising

1015
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:37,900
and i'm looking for girls i'm going to singles bars and stuff and all the guys in the singles

1016
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:43,020
bars they're airline pilots lawyers doctors they're all media planners probably too it's

1017
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:46,460
the lowest of the low in the advertising business at least it was in those days

1018
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:56,140
so i come from a father who's never lie never lie it's basic it's in your my blood

1019
01:50:56,780 --> 01:51:02,300
so i'm not going to say i'm a doctor or a lawyer i said i'm a media planner i was getting nowhere

1020
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:09,580
because i'm not the prettiest thing that ever walked yours come on whitley and no no i mean

1021
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:13,100
you know don't sell yourself you've been this you've been this you guys have been you might

1022
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:19,580
do better in singles bars than i did i did not do what so i see in the village voices now amara

1023
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:31,580
and i just bring up aliens because you know we met it's actually alien yeah sorry um so you had

1024
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:37,500
to go into the single bars in new york so i i i give up on that because i'm wasting my money clearly

1025
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:47,100
and um i see this thing in the village voice for something called mind mates and i think great my

1026
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:54,380
main problem has always been i want really smart girls because i want a girl i want someone who's

1027
01:51:54,380 --> 01:52:01,580
really really really smart preferably smarter than me i figure i'll try this so i try mind mates i

1028
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:07,420
they send this packet with i spend like two or three hours writing essays and filling out

1029
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:13,580
forms it's a very serious deal i mean they're really into this and then my stuff in a couple

1030
01:52:13,580 --> 01:52:20,700
weeks later a list comes back and it's got like five names on it all of the names are the last

1031
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:30,700
names of fish are close to it like salmon uh salomon and there's a trout and all is

1032
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:38,700
what the hell is this and there's one name on it maddox which is not a fish and i think is it

1033
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:42,940
the fish are all fake and i actually was only sent one name when i was supposed to be sent five

1034
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:49,340
so i call one of the fish and she's real she is a fish i mean she is trout or whatever it was

1035
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:57,420
so i can't just hang up on her so i we have a date doesn't work i figure no more fish i'm going to

1036
01:52:57,420 --> 01:53:04,780
call the one that's not a fish so i call maddox she's the receptionist or she's at she says she

1037
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:10,540
works at a certain place and as an avenue not far from where i was advertising so i go there

1038
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:19,420
and this receptionist is sitting there with excellent various things about her

1039
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:27,260
and she looks up at me with these big brown eyes and i think oh god if only ann maddox looks like

1040
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:40,220
this girl and i say i'm here to meet ann maddox she says i'm ann we were not part again

1041
01:53:40,860 --> 01:53:48,700
um for more than two weeks for the next 45 years wow my best friend who i talked about earlier the

1042
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:55,020
first thing i did was take her down to washington to meet him and his wife and he says to me quit

1043
01:53:55,660 --> 01:54:02,940
don't let this one go and ann always said i got the informant when he said that when i told her

1044
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:09,500
he had said it and i said she said when i heard that i knew i was in and i said you were in before

1045
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:16,700
that baby i was no way i was ever going to let you go she became my wife and ann went back to

1046
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:24,620
school and got a degree in english literature to be my editor and you know i wrote seven novels

1047
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:32,700
before i published the wolf and and i got close with some of them one of them was so annoying that

1048
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:37,820
this agent calls me and says i'd like you to come over i'd like to talk about your book

1049
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:46,300
and i thought i said to ann it's a big agent candida nanadia or something jeff brown i think

1050
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:51,500
his name was he was a big agent so i'm very excited i think finally i've got an agent

1051
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:57,180
he go over to his office sits down across from me at his desk and he says i just want to tell you

1052
01:54:57,900 --> 01:55:05,820
that book was the most annoying thing i've ever read in my life it was called the searchlight horror

1053
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:13,100
and it's about this town where nobody can leave and everybody gets killed and everything in these

1054
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:18,300
bizarre accidents and every time you get into a character they get killed and that's what

1055
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:24,140
makes the book so annoying and ann read it and she said yeah whitley he's right this is infuriating

1056
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:27,740
in fact i'm not going to finish it because i'm going to beat you up if i finish it wow so and

1057
01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:33,340
but you're almost implying before getting into describing her that uh there's something very

1058
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:38,460
special about ann as far as her role in your life above and beyond a romantic one

1059
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:45,180
weird stuff started to happen as soon as we were together like what well the first i'm not sure

1060
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:50,380
this was the first thing that happened uh hey here i'll give you a couple of examples

1061
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:59,100
there was a we lived on west 55th street in manhattan on between eighth and ninth you cross

1062
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:03,340
eighth and then you get to seventh avenue and there's a little distance between

1063
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:10,460
seventh avenue and broadway and in that little area there was a place we laughingly would call

1064
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:19,100
the whore store it was a little uh storefront it's probably not there anymore and um you would see

1065
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:25,420
every once in a while a attractive looking young woman sitting in the storefront in a skimpy dress

1066
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:32,220
with her legs crossed and a green curtain behind her and we would pass it back and forth because

1067
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:37,740
we haunted the bookstores that were then lined madison avenue and we would laugh and say the

1068
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:45,580
whore store is open tonight one night we're we're going home and the chair is on its side the

1069
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:53,180
curtains flying back and forth in there and there's a guy trying in a brown suit trying to get out and

1070
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:59,980
he's being pulled back by these blue dwarfs and we watched this for a second what the hell

1071
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:06,940
and i say to ann we've got to call the police and you know there's no cell phones so we're not far

1072
01:57:06,940 --> 01:57:14,060
from home so we run home we're going to call the police and she says what do we tell them

1073
01:57:15,740 --> 01:57:20,060
and i think to myself we're going to tell them that there's this place where these blue dwarfs

1074
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:26,140
are trying to kidnap some guy and drag him behind a curtain then that is not going to work i mean

1075
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:32,540
this is new york city i thought i thought to myself the police will come here they're not going there

1076
01:57:33,260 --> 01:57:38,220
so we don't call the police we also didn't go by the whore store at night again

1077
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:44,700
that's one of the many things that happened many some of them were hilarious it's almost like uh

1078
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:50,780
your local shared reality with ann was sort of divergent from the consensus reality that we

1079
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:56,380
all precisely precisely because you know later these blue figures which played a i didn't remember

1080
01:57:56,380 --> 01:58:01,260
at the time they played a role in my childhood they've played a role in the whole experience

1081
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:09,340
in my life i'll tell you something else about lori barnes was our secretary and was reading

1082
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:14,220
she was getting heaps and heaps of letters and i was saying you know we can't throw them out

1083
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:17,980
because they're very private many of them they got people's names and addresses what are we going

1084
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:22,860
to do yeah and just for context after community came out tens of thousands if not hundreds of

1085
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:27,820
thousands of people were sending letters to whaley's home because he left he left his address

1086
01:58:27,820 --> 01:58:33,580
being like expecting you know maybe 10 20 people to send ends up shutting down the whole the the

1087
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:39,340
post office in there in his town the abduction researcher the pioneering abduction researcher

1088
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:46,620
bud hopkins who i pissed off unfortunately um but you know that's the story of my life a good man

1089
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:52,140
was the one who said i should do that and it was very important very important so i want to just

1090
01:58:52,140 --> 01:59:00,620
honor bud for that uh anyway uh we've got these heaps of letters coming in and and i said i can't

1091
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:04,460
what are we going to do i mean they're literally pouring them on the on the living room floor in

1092
01:59:04,460 --> 01:59:13,900
heaps and um uh she's i said i can't read these she said well i can read them and she gets a she

1093
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:18,380
gets her letter when she starts she was a speed reader she could sit down and she could literally

1094
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:24,860
read a big complex novel in two hours easily she was really smart she was smarter than me and that's

1095
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:32,060
exactly what i was looking for as i wanted to marry a genius and i did so uh anyway she's reading

1096
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:37,020
these letters she hires a secretary and they'll come back into it and say we're gonna get him

1097
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:42,300
back to the blue guys at or burns and they're working on the letters and they're all

1098
01:59:43,740 --> 01:59:49,660
four or five thousand of them are now at rice university in a in an archive called the archives

1099
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:57,820
of the impossible founded by jeff kreipel and uh so they're beautifully beautifully uh uh uh

1100
01:59:58,780 --> 02:00:02,380
uh curated now they're so it's wonderful that they're there

1101
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:09,340
so she comes out of her office one day he says whitley this has something to do with what we call

1102
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:18,540
death and the letters again and again will mention the dead in connection with the visitors

1103
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:24,620
and when we would have she would choose people to come up to the cabin don't worry i haven't

1104
02:00:24,620 --> 02:00:30,220
forgotten the blue guys yet uh and she would say this letter should this person we're gonna

1105
02:00:30,220 --> 02:00:34,700
have them up to the cabin and when she would get these groups up at the cabin the visitors

1106
02:00:34,700 --> 02:00:42,780
would show up wow she knew who to get sounds like ann was and did this and named the book communion

1107
02:00:42,780 --> 02:00:52,380
wow and ann ann said things like i asked ann what is enlightened she says enlightenment is what

1108
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:58,540
happens when there's nothing left of you but love kind of the opposite of today's day well

1109
02:00:58,540 --> 02:01:03,980
nowadays we think of it very intellectually yes you know it's it's informational that's so wild

1110
02:01:05,180 --> 02:01:10,940
like one of my favorite quotes that drive this quest is the highest form of knowledge is empathy

1111
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:17,980
segues back to the telepaths you're not going to the hill unless you are kind and you do not lie

1112
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:25,420
that that's the those are essential criteria so um she hires the secretary lori barnes and

1113
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:32,620
they're working on the letters here is lori's story and now we're getting back to the blue guys

1114
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:41,580
in this long complicated segue uh lori's story is this is back in the 50s 54 i think it was

1115
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:48,780
she's lying in bed at night alone her husband's they were they were show people and he was on a

1116
02:01:48,780 --> 02:01:56,060
gig and she notices movement out of the corner of her eye she's reading it's about 11 o'clock

1117
02:01:56,060 --> 02:02:00,860
12 o'clock at night she's waiting for her husband to come home she's pregnant and

1118
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:09,580
she looks up and there standing beside the bed is this horrible looking blue dwarf

1119
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:16,460
and behind it are the line of others just like it and of course she recoils

1120
02:02:18,220 --> 02:02:23,660
and it says to her do not be afraid we're not here for you

1121
02:02:25,740 --> 02:02:33,900
we're interested in the girl child you're carrying and of course she's not not made any

1122
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:41,340
more calm by that and of course it's the 50s so we don't know what the boy or girl turned out to

1123
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:49,100
be a girl she i know her we've talked she's a very nice person she has a lovely career there's

1124
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:55,260
nothing about her it would say she's in any way an unusual human being except she's a very good

1125
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:57,820
sweet person and it does a lot of good in the world

1126
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:10,220
okay so this happens and she recoils from the creature at that point and it says to her

1127
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:18,460
why do you fear us so and she says you're so ugly and it says something now

1128
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:28,300
it gets to the way deep into the heart of this whole thing says one day my dear you will look

1129
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:38,860
just like us oof lori has passed on i have wondered if the little blue guy is going to show up in my

1130
02:03:38,860 --> 02:03:45,580
life with but so far i haven't heard any scent any sense of her presence at all i do get the

1131
02:03:45,580 --> 02:03:51,260
presence of a lot of dead people but i haven't heard from lori what were john mac stanton

1132
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:56,380
friedman these sort of legendary figures in the ufo world what were they like because you knew

1133
02:03:56,380 --> 02:04:04,780
both personally yeah uh well stanton was stanton died basically running through an airport i mean

1134
02:04:04,780 --> 02:04:10,700
stanton was the most driven human being i've ever known he would go anywhere he would do anything

1135
02:04:10,700 --> 02:04:17,260
he would not stop and he was very coy about whether or not he had been activated by activated i

1136
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:21,980
mean you see a ufo up close or you have a close encounter experience you're activated

1137
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:28,300
most people who that happens to they a lot of people don't remember it a lot of people can blow

1138
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:35,180
it off but there are certain people who just will not stop they will not stop and so the ufo almost

1139
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:40,380
installs in them some sort of drive or mission to for disclosure or like an

1140
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:47,980
insatiable curiosity or it installs within them a burning question and they can't let that go

1141
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:54,620
it's a wonderful a lot of the people in this field are much more wonderful than the outside world

1142
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:59,180
realizes that you like you get a room full of close encounter witnesses together they're all

1143
02:04:59,180 --> 02:05:04,620
incredibly sweet and mild you think to yourself well agrees they're little and they're fragile

1144
02:05:05,180 --> 02:05:11,820
of course they abduct people who are mild-mannered right and children and children and i'm very mild

1145
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:17,500
i should be i'm be as mild-mannered as i am but i am very mild-mannered um and was the one with

1146
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:23,180
the temper she could blow up in your face very easily and but stan friedman's to me always stood

1147
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:28,380
out along with john mack is these guys who are extremely rigorous smart and accomplished in

1148
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:33,180
their sort of day job roles you know john mack was obviously head of the harvard psychiatry

1149
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:38,380
department and stan friedman was like this westinghouse nuclear engineer right you know

1150
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:45,100
laurence rockefeller who was passed on sadly and was very interested in as much the annoyance of

1151
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:55,180
other members of his family not all but some um invited me and uh john mack and edgar mitchell

1152
02:05:55,820 --> 02:06:07,180
and uh joe rules who's a ufo investigator from el paso to his medway plantation in uh south carolina

1153
02:06:07,820 --> 02:06:15,180
to just sit together and have a you know with our wives and significant others and just spend a

1154
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:21,740
weekend together and it was wonderful time and i got to know jack john better than than i had before

1155
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:29,180
what was that group like and what was laurence rockefeller like and john was a laurence was a

1156
02:06:29,180 --> 02:06:39,340
very he was a good man he had a good heart and he was very curious and for whatever reason

1157
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:45,100
he knew this was real yeah i find that so fascinating that some of these elite families

1158
02:06:45,100 --> 02:06:51,500
have such a deep interest in laurence rockefeller specifically in the 90s was trying to get hillary

1159
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:57,420
interested in this like right yeah the photo of her holding are we alone by paul davies right and

1160
02:06:57,420 --> 02:07:02,300
it's a gift from laurence rockefeller who was trying to get her more into disclosure and

1161
02:07:02,300 --> 02:07:07,340
understand kind of the reality of of non-human intelligence so so you got the sense that he

1162
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:13,660
he knew like it's like he didn't use something laurence knew something and uh uh bootsie galbraith

1163
02:07:13,660 --> 02:07:20,380
uh was also a friend of laurence's and you know i tried to warm out a bootsie of what uh laurence

1164
02:07:20,380 --> 02:07:26,140
knew and what they knew but she was quite coy about it she'd been turned on in an interesting

1165
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:34,220
way she was in mexico with steven greer and he called in the ufo and they all saw it so didn't

1166
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:40,940
didn't the rockefellers both on john mack and steven greer as well in the 90s i believe yeah

1167
02:07:40,940 --> 02:07:45,820
and they funded the princeton parapsychology lab which was studying mind over matter so

1168
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:51,500
okay so what was john mack like was he he was well first of all we were both cut ups when we were

1169
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:56,860
kids and played a lot of practical jokes and made bombs and did all kinds of crazy things you can't

1170
02:07:56,860 --> 02:08:03,020
do anymore and uh so we had a lot to talk about we had loads of fun talking about our childhoods

1171
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:13,900
and uh he was a very very smart man he was too smart to be deceived by assumptions

1172
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:19,100
that defines his mind better in fewer words than any i can think of

1173
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:24,780
he was too smart to be deceived by assumptions i will never forget the day

1174
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:34,540
i got a call and he is practically in tears he just had the ambush and he said they're going to

1175
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:40,700
try a harvard take at harvard yeah he was invited to a meeting it was actually an ambush

1176
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:45,340
and they're going to try to take away my license to practice psychiatry

1177
02:08:46,140 --> 02:08:51,100
and they're going to try to take away my tenure and i said john what are you going to do

1178
02:08:52,460 --> 02:09:00,060
there was a silence on i never would forget that was hard

1179
02:09:02,620 --> 02:09:07,820
it was broody what they did to him they went after him roger leer had the same thing happen

1180
02:09:07,820 --> 02:09:12,380
they get went after him they tried to get get rid of him get take away his license practice

1181
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:17,820
it's these show trials and dr diane powell of the telepathy tapes i was just gonna mention

1182
02:09:17,820 --> 02:09:21,820
new john mack when they were at harvard together they had offices down the hall from one another

1183
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:28,380
her medical license got revoked for studying his telepathic children well you know there's two

1184
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:36,940
sides here the side of Galileo and the side of the inquisition and let's face it it's very obvious

1185
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:46,940
that dr powell dr mack the others dr leer are on the side of Galileo and these other

1186
02:09:46,940 --> 02:09:55,260
creeps are on the side of the inquisition and they function like inquisitors yeah i always wonder

1187
02:09:55,260 --> 02:10:03,260
it's 100 amar and i were at the dc hearings you know a few weeks ago and this just straight up

1188
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:09,580
spook came up to us and in the hotel that we were staying at yells at us from across the hall

1189
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:15,980
our friend chris ramsey who's an amazing magician from canada who's gotten super interested in the

1190
02:10:15,980 --> 02:10:20,780
ufo thing he's actually a world famous magician kind of knows when people have tricks up their

1191
02:10:20,780 --> 02:10:24,780
sleeves because a lot of you know the name he's made as a magician is actually debunking other

1192
02:10:24,780 --> 02:10:30,380
magician's tricks or elucidating them and showing how they work and so this guy is provoking us

1193
02:10:30,380 --> 02:10:34,700
trying to get basically get us to say that we're cynical about disclosure and like don't believe

1194
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:39,180
in ufos and aliens by saying asking these leading questions saying you know it's all

1195
02:10:39,180 --> 02:10:43,660
bullshit right you know you guys are just doing for content right you want clicks you want likes

1196
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:49,340
whatever and then chris after he leaves it's like that guy had his hand in his right pocket

1197
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:53,500
the whole time and was definitely trying to record you and anyways going back to this kind of

1198
02:10:53,500 --> 02:11:00,140
establishment you know scapegoater role versus the truth seeker innocent truth seeker

1199
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:07,020
i think about people on that side like that guy like what's your psychology like do you do you

1200
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:12,060
have any historical context for what you're doing like if you if you're if you're just persecuting

1201
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:17,820
people earnestly looking into you know truth like how do you live with yourself and do you have zero

1202
02:11:17,820 --> 02:11:22,380
like metaphysical understanding like you don't think any of your earthly actions have any

1203
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:26,700
implications for what you do in the futures all just you're expedient expediently aligning

1204
02:11:26,700 --> 02:11:30,780
yourself with establishment forces you just want a promotion like like what do you think is going

1205
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:38,460
to happen to you you know you don't want to do that because you don't want we have souls

1206
02:11:39,660 --> 02:11:46,380
and we're anesthetized to our souls for a reason so that we can live free but

1207
02:11:47,260 --> 02:11:52,460
no you definitely don't want to live a lie in lies and you don't want to hurt other people

1208
02:11:53,420 --> 02:12:02,380
you have to um like and another thing ann said it's so powerful i asked her what compassion was

1209
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:08,300
because i'm really interested in compassion i want to be a compassionate man i want to be a good man

1210
02:12:09,180 --> 02:12:17,020
and she says to me she didn't answer the question directly she says each of us is all we have

1211
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:25,100
and that really went through me because you know when i'm on the street and i'm

1212
02:12:25,900 --> 02:12:33,580
someone's pissing me off or i'm i'm i'm a driver in la and there are there's the odd three-minute

1213
02:12:33,580 --> 02:12:42,380
period when i'm not pissed off uh and i always think of this these words and i'm face to face

1214
02:12:42,380 --> 02:12:47,740
with someone i really don't like and don't want to be with this person is all they have

1215
02:12:49,420 --> 02:12:56,060
it changes everything it's incredibly powerful it makes you into a better person just by knowing

1216
02:12:56,060 --> 02:13:02,860
those few words and keeping them in your it's amazing you know that's power that's word power

1217
02:13:02,860 --> 02:13:09,260
of the first order yeah and we are all on a journey and i think it's some you know there's

1218
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:16,460
evil is typically depicted as being consciously tyrannical evil you know sort of like mastermind

1219
02:13:16,460 --> 02:13:21,340
evil often it's just being unconscious it's just you know acting on sort of these primitive

1220
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:26,460
instincts that are is often the default and and emerges if you don't kind of consciously override

1221
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:33,980
it or seek virtue and uh yeah i think uh y'all just need to look at ourselves and she would always

1222
02:13:33,980 --> 02:13:40,060
engage with homeless people and stuff and and and what yeah and i i would say you know uh

1223
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:47,740
how can you know whether or not you know i always would she said just don't judge them

1224
02:13:49,020 --> 02:13:55,980
you'll feel which ones can use your help and which ones can't just don't judge them don't

1225
02:13:55,980 --> 02:14:00,380
don't go there witley don't go to that part of your head you don't know why they're there out

1226
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:06,860
in the street and you never will it's not your business speaking of which given that you wrote

1227
02:14:06,860 --> 02:14:14,220
a book on jesus jesus has been sort of rewritten by the likes of thomas jefferson steven mitchell

1228
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:19,820
all sorts of writers yourself now what do you think most people misunderstand about him

1229
02:14:19,820 --> 02:14:24,060
and they misunderstand

1230
02:14:26,300 --> 02:14:32,380
well a lot of things but the most misunderstood thing is in modern times is the resurrection

1231
02:14:32,860 --> 02:14:42,060
of a jefferson bible takes it out it should not be taken out in jesus in new vision i go into exactly

1232
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:46,780
why it actually happened and this gets way back to the beginning of our conversation when you

1233
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:56,460
mentioned that suffering has something to do with these extraordinarily powerful states it

1234
02:14:56,460 --> 02:15:04,060
activates something that happened to jesus what happened in the tomb was a real thing and the

1235
02:15:04,060 --> 02:15:09,580
book lays out exactly what happened because there's been magnificent research done on it that's

1236
02:15:09,580 --> 02:15:17,020
ignored because it doesn't fit the paradigm but in fact he did come out of the tomb the tomb was

1237
02:15:17,020 --> 02:15:26,220
empty when mary came back yeah as a light being and and the shroud remember he said if you do not

1238
02:15:26,220 --> 02:15:33,180
follow me i will return as a thief in the night and then and in jesus a new vision i point out

1239
02:15:33,180 --> 02:15:39,340
the time of that return it was 1898 when the first photograph was taken of the shroud

1240
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:46,700
that was the moment he returned and we saw him on the shroud the shroud is amazing and i think it

1241
02:15:46,700 --> 02:15:53,100
was studied by like nasa yeah well it was studied by a group of group of air force guys air force

1242
02:15:53,100 --> 02:15:57,900
yeah yeah and they claimed to debunk it but they only took a little piece of it or something oh no

1243
02:15:57,900 --> 02:16:03,260
i'll tell you the story i'm very close to this story yeah uh father peter rinaldi was a friend

1244
02:16:03,260 --> 02:16:09,500
of ann's she had you know if you ever go to new york when you go to new york go down to laguardia

1245
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:19,980
place and between laguardia and uh right off of right uh immediately north of uh of uh howston

1246
02:16:19,980 --> 02:16:25,980
street and rather at bleaker street is 520 laguardia on one side and there's this beautiful

1247
02:16:25,980 --> 02:16:31,660
park on the other side called laguardia park if you go you'll see a statue of laguardia in there

1248
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:36,300
and you look down at the bottom of the statue and there's a plaque and all these famous

1249
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:43,580
social people are on the plaque and so are the names ann and whitley streiber and one day we

1250
02:16:43,580 --> 02:16:47,740
lived in the building 520 laguardia place she was looking down there and she said you know i'm going

1251
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:54,140
to turn that into a park it was just a place you know it was a druggie hangout and stuff

1252
02:16:54,140 --> 02:16:58,300
and she said i said how can you do that i visualized her going down there with a shovel

1253
02:16:58,300 --> 02:17:03,900
she said well i'm gonna do it and she called got all her friends going and got them networking

1254
02:17:04,460 --> 02:17:09,340
and soon they had millions of dollars to build this park and to create the statue and permission

1255
02:17:09,340 --> 02:17:15,020
from the city and there's the plaque there's the statue it's a wonderful statue of laguardia the

1256
02:17:15,020 --> 02:17:22,460
park is so verdant and full of birds and that's ann i'll go i will go there don't miss it it's

1257
02:17:22,460 --> 02:17:28,860
like it's a pilgrimage place next time i'll definitely be too yeah yeah i love to meditate

1258
02:17:28,860 --> 02:17:37,820
in that park now so what happens to jesus is this in at least i understand it he goes to egypt

1259
02:17:38,940 --> 02:17:49,260
he understands the resurrection technique there and he sets out to do this

1260
02:17:49,980 --> 02:17:59,500
in i retranslated the sayings gospel of thomas it's easy i mean it's very simple

1261
02:18:00,140 --> 02:18:05,260
the gospel of thomas is remarkable it's absolutely extraordinary but what do you say to the people

1262
02:18:05,260 --> 02:18:08,860
because i'll argue all day with like conventional christians where i'm like

1263
02:18:09,500 --> 02:18:13,900
i think that book is really special and then they say oh it was found you know it was first of all

1264
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:19,260
it was written 150 years later after his death and it was found you know 1948 in this sort of

1265
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:24,140
you know pile of the you know the nakamati or whatever the sayings gospel of thomas according

1266
02:18:24,140 --> 02:18:29,180
to the the q scholars is the oldest gospel and they're probably right okay so it's the oldest

1267
02:18:29,180 --> 02:18:33,900
gospel right it was the beginning of the of the story let's go to the thread of you saying that

1268
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:40,780
jesus went to egypt he learned this technique in egypt and the technique is sort of the mystery

1269
02:18:40,780 --> 02:18:48,780
ritual resurrection total ego death and we're going to get back to the part about the the

1270
02:18:48,780 --> 02:18:52,460
discovery of the shroud and the work that was done on it in a minute i don't want to forget that and

1271
02:18:52,460 --> 02:19:01,020
we could quit yeah uh he then in effect becomes a magician at a time where in the roman empire

1272
02:19:01,020 --> 02:19:07,420
the cornelian laws are in effect and they will kill you in all kinds of very very depressing ways

1273
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:11,980
if they catch you being a magician so he's very careful that's why he tells people don't tell

1274
02:19:11,980 --> 02:19:18,860
anyone that i'm doing this he understands something about the mind and my new book is

1275
02:19:18,860 --> 02:19:25,100
all about this it's about recovering this power yeah because we can all do this i believe that

1276
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:33,580
and this is where i differ from the conventional christians jesus is in all of us that power is in

1277
02:19:33,580 --> 02:19:41,580
all of us he wasn't here to put himself on a peasant pedestal he was here to say i am the son

1278
02:19:41,580 --> 02:19:47,980
of man i am a human being well in the in the gospel of thomas doesn't he take thomas who's

1279
02:19:47,980 --> 02:19:55,100
typically depicted as you know this judas judas says this like betrayer he takes thomas aside

1280
02:19:55,100 --> 02:19:59,340
and he whispers secret words to him yes and so what are those what are those secret words

1281
02:19:59,340 --> 02:20:06,700
well he doesn't tell but they the other disciples ask him what did he say and he says

1282
02:20:07,340 --> 02:20:15,340
they say thomas says if i told you you would stone him to death in the sayings gospel he says

1283
02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:23,580
don't believe me i'm not a teacher he says go out among the gentiles and eat the food you're given

1284
02:20:24,460 --> 02:20:31,820
violate the law to a total revolutionary what he's saying is leave your ego behind

1285
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:41,180
and be you your real self and it doesn't matter everything depends on this do anything to find

1286
02:20:41,180 --> 02:20:49,900
yourself it goes all the way back to the delphic oracle know thyself and this is also the word the

1287
02:20:49,900 --> 02:20:56,860
core word of jesus know thyself and the kingdom of heaven is within you and all around you

1288
02:20:56,860 --> 02:21:03,660
and all around you but find it be as little children what's the other gospel thomas quote

1289
02:21:03,660 --> 02:21:09,420
it's um if you look up the birds will precede you if you look to the sea the fish will precede you

1290
02:21:09,420 --> 02:21:15,260
the kingdom of heaven is within you right and the great poetry of being is there yes it's a

1291
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:20,380
poetry of being it's so it's fascinating and and we you know i just interviewed doc uh colonel

1292
02:21:20,380 --> 02:21:27,260
carl now who he kind of traces back the origins of these sort of esoteric versions of religion

1293
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:32,300
that he thinks all kind of bounds together in this kind of hermetic lineage and he talks about the

1294
02:21:32,300 --> 02:21:37,820
festival of said and the egyptian magical papyri where you have these sort of you know secret

1295
02:21:37,820 --> 02:21:41,580
brotherhoods in egypt that's very interesting i did not know that i want to talk to curl about

1296
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:45,740
that i know don't know him well i sent him an arc of my new book and that's an advanced reading

1297
02:21:45,740 --> 02:21:51,100
copy of my new book i haven't heard back yet from anyone i sent all my friends that arc i sent it

1298
02:21:51,100 --> 02:21:57,980
i even sent it to robert bigelow who i don't i know but not well and uh uh i sent it to jacques

1299
02:21:57,980 --> 02:22:04,860
valet and leslie cain who is a close friend and of course jeff kreipel and hal puthoff has been a

1300
02:22:04,860 --> 02:22:11,100
friend since forever i mean we've been friends since i was a since i was up we've been friends

1301
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:15,740
for over 30 years since how old were you well since the communion experience since community

1302
02:22:15,740 --> 02:22:21,580
okay so so um let's go to the shroud of turenne because i have a friend named randall carlson

1303
02:22:21,580 --> 02:22:27,340
works a lot with graham hankock incredibly smart just super rigorous i would not do justice to his

1304
02:22:28,060 --> 02:22:33,100
work on this topic but he has all sorts of prince first principles arguments as to why

1305
02:22:33,100 --> 02:22:39,020
the shroud of turenne is absolutely real it is he's probably right okay here's what happened

1306
02:22:39,740 --> 02:22:47,580
a father peter rinaldi who and knew uh calls us up one day calls her up one day and says i want

1307
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:52,220
you to come to a meeting we're having a meeting about the shroud of turenne would you be interested

1308
02:22:53,020 --> 02:22:56,940
and she of course says yes we'll come and i said what is the shroud of turenne

1309
02:22:57,580 --> 02:23:01,980
she said well let's go to the meeting we'll find out we go to the meeting and it's with

1310
02:23:02,060 --> 02:23:07,900
jackson and jumper the two guys who were they're fundraising for the initial studies

1311
02:23:08,860 --> 02:23:16,620
and um i never meet them i mean i talk like you know in a fundraiser context but i never

1312
02:23:16,620 --> 02:23:22,460
like become friends or anything with them so we contributed as much money as we could afford to

1313
02:23:22,460 --> 02:23:30,220
it a few thousand dollars and we follow it and they do their stuff and it's all in the papers

1314
02:23:30,220 --> 02:23:37,020
and then i hear that material has been taken from the shroud and it's going to be sent to

1315
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:49,260
oxford and i write father rinaldi a letter do not do this they have to defend their paradigm

1316
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:58,620
they will lie without knowing it and they do very that very thing they say the shroud is from the

1317
02:23:58,620 --> 02:24:07,660
middle ages they destroy the research but it doesn't end because this is humanity and there

1318
02:24:07,660 --> 02:24:16,380
are other people in the world who have a better grasp of the truth here they can feel the energy

1319
02:24:16,940 --> 02:24:24,060
and other scientists and now jesus in new vision sums up where they are and where they are as you

1320
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:31,820
can't deny it anymore if you're a real scientist the shroud is the single strangest thing on planet

1321
02:24:31,820 --> 02:24:40,620
earth and it is that way because it records the moment a human being whose body had expired

1322
02:24:40,620 --> 02:24:44,140
transformed into a being of light what makes you think it's real

1323
02:24:45,820 --> 02:24:53,100
uh the weave of the cloth the pollens found on it all place it in exactly that place yeah and time

1324
02:24:53,660 --> 02:25:03,100
the uh uh image itself could not have been produced by almost anything except a sudden

1325
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:09,900
burst of neurons and remember the rending of the of the curtain in the temple in the earthquake

1326
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:17,020
that was the moment of the resurrection it's a tremendously powerful event a burst of neurons

1327
02:25:17,020 --> 02:25:25,180
burst of of energy that involves uh a neutron neutrons involves a it involves an expression

1328
02:25:25,180 --> 02:25:31,020
of a burst of neutrons and that's what burned the image into the shroud and that's the whole

1329
02:25:31,020 --> 02:25:38,140
thing of like maybe that intense suffering it cracked all the way back to the in that

1330
02:25:38,140 --> 02:25:43,340
kind of electromagnetic the neutron burst and then you're in there are all these ancient art

1331
02:25:43,340 --> 02:25:49,340
depictions of like saints and holy figures traveling up in this kind of cobalistic like

1332
02:25:49,340 --> 02:25:54,700
bubble envelope thing like this yes celestial ascents vehicle maricaba vehicle or what a wheel

1333
02:25:54,700 --> 02:26:00,220
of ezekiel you know the whole theme of this conversation it goes back to what you just said

1334
02:26:00,860 --> 02:26:06,460
we've been talking about the power of suffering in all kinds of different ways over the course of

1335
02:26:06,460 --> 02:26:11,740
this conversation and now here we are coming to the end of it and we're talking about the ultimate

1336
02:26:11,740 --> 02:26:16,620
moment that the power of human suffering was expressed into the world by jesus

1337
02:26:17,180 --> 02:26:23,020
in his resurrection and this is where we have to go we have to go back to an understanding of that

1338
02:26:23,020 --> 02:26:31,020
which is also an understanding of ourselves and face the hardest thing of all which is this place

1339
02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:36,140
is a miracle it is a whole this whole planet is a miracle and that's why all of these

1340
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:43,660
un-miraculous but fascinated creatures are going around here and why they do not want us to kill

1341
02:26:43,660 --> 02:26:50,140
ourselves off on that note i just makes me want to go pray on it like that's definitely what i'm

1342
02:26:50,140 --> 02:26:56,060
gonna go do but like yeah oh we should do a prayer session after that yeah for sure i can't think of

1343
02:26:56,060 --> 02:27:00,940
