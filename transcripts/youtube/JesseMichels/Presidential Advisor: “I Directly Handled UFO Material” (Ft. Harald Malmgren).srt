1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's not enough for anyone to understand the world and how the world works, it just is.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,120
It's October of 1962, the heart of the Cold War. Images from an American U-2 revealed that the

3
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,720
Soviet Union had secretly begun building missile bases in Cuba, just 90 miles off the coast of

4
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:58,920
Florida. Strategic Air Command was placed in DEFCON 2, the only time that's ever happened in the history

5
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,720
of the United States. Khrushchev and Kennedy both had top military strategists pushing them to draw

6
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,600
first blood. We are asking tonight that an emergency meeting of the Security Council be

7
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,720
convoked without delay. Curtis LeMay, head of the Strategic Air Command of the Air Force, wanted to

8
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,920
deal a death blow to the Soviets. Amidst this tense backdrop, Secretary of Defense Robert

9
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,320
McNamara called one of his top aides, a 27-year-old whiz kid named Harold Malmgren,

10
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:39,000
into the Situation Room. Don't tell them what you think should happen. Ask them a lot of questions.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,440
Your job is to slow them down, reduce the heat in the room, and give us time to work something out.

12
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:53,800
Miraculously, the Hail Mary worked. Harold, the youngest man in the Situation Room, ran circles

13
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,920
around one of the most aggressive four-star generals in American history. And if I remember

14
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,640
correctly, you kind of rhetorically back them into a corner where you say, what would be your prime

15
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,120
target first? Yeah, I said, it's madness. If you hit Moscow, there's no one to talk to. And then

16
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:18,600
at that point, LeMay storms out. Yeah, he literally got up and slammed his papers down. I'm not going,

17
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,240
I refuse to run with this. Malmgren went on to become a top presidential advisor for JFK,

18
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,400
LBJ, Nixon, and Ford. And the fact that he neutralized LeMay and saved the world is the

19
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,120
least interesting thing I'll be discussing with him. You've been dropping bombs on the internet,

20
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:45,640
saying some amazing things. JFK fully knew all about UFOs long before he became president.

21
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,520
Harold had been tweeting things that have taken it all seriously alongside his credentials and

22
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,520
background would wholesale overturn your worldview. No, instead of handling them, these are things

23
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,480
that have come down. So you're looking at like material, anomalous material. Yeah. Debris. Yeah.

24
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,160
This interview changed my life forever and will hopefully do the same for you. In it,

25
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,680
Harold admits to directly handling UFO material that fell out of the plume of a

26
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,600
Marshall Islands nuclear test. This is world history. It's the first time anybody of this

27
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,480
caliber has ever admitted to handling UFO material directly. What did it feel like?

28
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,800
It felt weird because it didn't feel anything like that.

29
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,480
He discusses getting briefed on other world technologies by deputy director of plans for

30
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,520
the CIA and chief architect of Area 51, Richard Bissell. Malmgren tells me that Bissell confirmed

31
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:58,760
to him the existence of the magenta UFO crash of 1933 in Italy recently reported on by UFO whistleblower

32
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:07,000
David Grush. He did. Richard Bissell mentioned the 1933 magenta crash. That's amazing. If that's not

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,480
enough, Malmgren also implies that he was being tracked by the majestic 12 from a young age.

34
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:37,000
The majestic 12 is an elite group of military science and government advisors

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,520
governing the UFO issue that were described in document leaks in the 80s and 90s. But this

36
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,760
is the first time anybody of this caliber has ever mentioned that name. You have uncovered

37
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:55,080
collaboration between Nikola Tesla and Thomas Townsend Brown. What source did you get it from?

38
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,920
Intelligence. We get into the Chinese science fiction novel, The Three Body Problem, which

39
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,160
Harold believes may be the best model we have for the UFO story. It's not just the atomic connection.

40
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,680
They're generically attracted to the tip of the spear as far as tech development. That's at the

41
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,880
heart of it. Yeah. Harold's daughter Pippa would know that. She was special assistant to President

42
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,120
Bush and on his national economic council. It's now public knowledge through how put off that

43
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,680
George W. Bush contemplated UFO disclosure with his national security advisor, Stephen Hadley.

44
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,520
As Pippa relayed to me, a lot of these high level disclosure discussions revolved around one

45
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,280
particular book, a Chinese science fiction novel called The Three Body Problem, which became

46
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,040
mandatory reading among many high level national security advisors in the United States. And to

47
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:54,840
fast forward spending time with my own father and discovering that he's been involved with this from

48
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,560
the earliest days. Finally, we discuss secret science going on at sensitive department of

49
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,240
energy sites across the country. Alan Dulles, the director of the CIA, the Italian mob,

50
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,920
secret societies, the JFK assassination, and how all of these might relate to UFOs.

51
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,520
The relationship needs to be uncovered between Angleton's father, Angleton, and the Knights of

52
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:29,160
Walter. Wow. Do you think that UFOs played any sort of part in JFK's death? Do I think so? Yes.

53
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,800
I think it was probably the number one issue.

54
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,960
In many ways, Malmgren was sort of a forest gump of global elite politics.

55
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,360
Pippa called, looked for me, found me in the crowd, brought me over, and he introduced me to

56
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:57,000
Putin. Now I knew enough to realize that that was not an accidental meeting. It became clear to me

57
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,560
in the midst of this interview that Harold was part of a much deeper intelligence network that

58
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,960
we barely scratched the surface on. You are now part of a network of people. It will be known

59
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,480
that you've been blessed. If I had a choice, I would have spent weeks with Harold going deep

60
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,440
on his vast knowledge of UFOs, deep politics, and global power structures.

61
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,880
Unfortunately, a day after our interview, we had to rush him to the hospital.

62
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,160
That hospital visit ended up lasting a few weeks, culminating in his tragic passing.

63
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,440
But when I was back in Austin, Harold insisted on speaking to me on the phone to follow up.

64
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,800
His vitals on the cusp of failure, just three days before his death, he revealed even more to me,

65
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,760
things that will make you further question your reality.

66
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,920
In this final courageous interview, Harold Malmgren transcends his earthly oaths and adheres

67
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:59,480
to a higher godly principle in one final act of service to humanity, one that may end up being

68
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:05,320
just as consequential as saving the earth from nuclear catastrophe with the help of the

69
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,320
world's most powerful nuclear weapons. In this final, courageous interview,

70
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,440
end up being just as consequential as saving the earth from nuclear catastrophe.

71
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,120
Without further ado, please welcome this week's American Alchemist, may he rest in peace,

72
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,560
presidential advisor and international peacekeeper, the honorable Harold Malmgren.

73
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:55,720
Hello? Harold, it's Jesse. Oh, hi Jesse, how are you?

74
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,880
Good, man. How are you is the more important question. You scared me last week.

75
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:11,160
I'm having to explain step by step who I am, how I happen to be here,

76
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,720
and each person says, oh, I didn't know that.

77
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,040
Well, I'm flanked by greatness and just honored to be here. I'm here with Dr. Harold Malmgren,

78
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:33,880
who was a presidential advisor to four different presidents, JFK, LBJ, Nixon, and Ford, among

79
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:40,280
various other amazing accolades. You helped stop a couple of global crises, if we're going to get

80
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:46,520
into that. But I think for the purposes of this conversation, you've been dropping bombs on the

81
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:54,040
internet and really saying some amazing things that deal with the nature of reality, non-human

82
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,520
intelligence, UFOs, or as they're commonly referred to now, UAPs, and informal briefs that

83
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,560
you've gotten on the subject. And so I couldn't be more excited to be speaking with you now about

84
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,720
all of this. And we also have Dr. Pippa Malmgren, who is equally amazing. And she was a special

85
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,160
assistant to George W. Bush on his national economic council. She's written a few great books. I

86
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,960
recommend you all check them out. And she's going to be joining us for this conversation as well.

87
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,840
So I'm honored to be here with both of you guys. Thank you so much for having us. Absolutely.

88
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:36,040
Well, I'm honored because I've watched your work with several people. And you've done an amazing

89
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:44,600
job. The most stuck in my mind is your interview with Matthew Pines. Well, that means so much.

90
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,840
Matthew Pines makes it easy. He's one of the smartest people I've met and has a really

91
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,960
interdisciplinary understanding. He can go from physics. I'm not a practicing physicist. It's not

92
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,280
my job. But I'm trying to familiarize myself with Garrett Lisey's stuff, with Sabina's stuff,

93
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,000
Wolfram and Jonathan Garrard. But he can also understand the minutiae of Washington and how

94
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,400
it works. Yeah, that's why I like him. He's unusual. He is very unusual. So you ended up

95
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,600
known as one of Robert McNamara's whiz kids, quote unquote. And just this kind of child prodigy,

96
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,720
but you grew up on the other side of the tracks. And so I'd love to hear just a little bit about

97
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:34,120
your childhood. Well, I was born in the middle of the Great Depression. And my mother and father

98
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:41,800
were immigrants from Sweden. We lived right by Narragansett Bay, just off the Atlantic.

99
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,320
When I was just turning seven, my mother said, well, this is the day you have to start working.

100
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,720
So when you come home from school, I'm going to take you down to the water and bring home dinner.

101
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:03,560
Because we were on rationing at that time, meat rationing. So I learned to use a boat,

102
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:11,400
learned to fish, learned to get crab traps, even had lobster traps,

103
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,120
dig up shellfish. So every day I brought home something. It became second nation. Sometimes

104
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,640
I had to stop and pick up a big piece of ice because we didn't have refrigerators. It was

105
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:35,560
really heavy. I was still little. Anyway, when I was 13 going on 14, just before my 14th birthday,

106
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:45,400
my father had found work as a restoration specialist. We restored old mansions

107
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:54,520
in Newport, around Boston, particularly near Cambridge. We were working on this big house.

108
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:04,920
He said, can you help me? It's the summer. And so I was working with steel wool and some kind of

109
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:15,720
and some kind of solution to clear walnut panels. And this big gentleman came in the room and said,

110
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:24,600
hello young man, what are you doing? I'm helping my dad. He said sit down and talk to me.

111
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,960
And that was a little bit unusual. Why does he want to talk to me? Anyway, we talked.

112
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,920
And he said, I want to take this boy out of your school. I want him to come in September

113
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:58,920
and matriculate at MIT. And we'll give him a full scholarship. I'm not sure he needs the full four

114
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,680
years. We'll give him all the years he needs. We'll give him an internship. You don't have to worry

115
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:12,520
about summers. And if all goes well, we'll take him all the way to the right of his school.

116
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:22,520
And I said, well bring him in. I'm not ready to leave home. And he said, listen to me. I'm really

117
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:31,960
offering a whole new life. He said, yeah, but I like my life. But he said he was president of MIT.

118
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:41,000
And I didn't know then the whole history of the large role he played in the Second World War.

119
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,720
I think he was in charge of the War Production Board at some point.

120
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,800
So this was Carl Compton, who was the sitting president of MIT, which allowed him,

121
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,720
he had the power to offer you a full ride. He had the power to do that.

122
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:06,040
We ended up friendly. But he said, you've talked about things that are very frontier of things.

123
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,960
At 13 or 14. Yeah, he said, you stunned me because you brought up what is a photon.

124
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,160
Why don't we understand it? Why don't we have a picture of it? We have a picture of everything

125
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:27,320
else. No proton. I said I thought about it and thought about it. I didn't know Einstein's

126
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:36,760
dilemma. So I said it's something that operates in interaction with something else, probably another

127
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:45,320
proton. And probably it's in pulses. And probably there doesn't matter how far apart. It's just that

128
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,120
interaction. But you can't get a picture of it because those pulses are so too fast.

129
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,880
And besides, it's two different things. Probably it's more than two. Probably it's many.

130
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,480
And that's the problem, that you're trying to get at something specific when it's not specific.

131
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,560
And he said, no, it's not that thing. So you don't understand. You have an invented mind.

132
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:18,600
You see beyond. But the biggest minds, I said yes, but I'm not ready to go home and leave home.

133
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,160
Malmgren displayed knowledge of physics concepts with Compton that he wasn't supposed to.

134
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,840
Not only because he was too young to know these concepts, but because they hadn't even been proven

135
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:44,280
experimentally yet. Entangled photons are considered a single system in quantum mechanics,

136
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,880
meaning that even when separated by large distances, they instantly affect each other's states,

137
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,400
essentially acting as a single unit. They also conserve quantum properties with respect to one

138
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:02,040
another. This is now commonplace knowledge, but Malmgren was saying this at the age of 14 in 1950.

139
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,880
And while entanglement as a concept was predicted by Einstein and his colleagues in 1935,

140
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,200
the treatment of entangled photons as a system was only made explicit in the 60s and 70s,

141
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,440
with Bell's Inequality Theorem and with the measurements of physicist John Clauser.

142
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,520
So how did young Malmgren understand this concept at 14 as a poor painter's son?

143
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,920
There's a bit of a back story, and part of my job in the interview is just to pull out some of this

144
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:37,960
background that led to my father's extraordinary career. But the key was before you met Carl

145
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:46,440
Compton, you'd written to the Atomic Energy Agency asking for background on nuclear physics.

146
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,680
So you'd at that age already read an immense amount.

147
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,560
At that age already read an immense amount.

148
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Can we show some of that correspondence?

149
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:05,400
This is amazing. This here, the control of atomic energy. So this is what they sent back to you.

150
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,480
Genetic effects of atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

151
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,840
See, that's really interesting. They were really interested in the genetic stuff. And you have

152
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,440
Detlev Brank is written about here. Detlev Brank was the president of the Rockefeller Foundation,

153
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:27,240
but he was also president of Johns Hopkins, who's rumored to be on this quote unquote majestic 12th

154
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,080
and do autopsies on non-human intelligence bodies. And so, and then you had all these studies going

155
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,960
on at the time, like the Cambridge labs, where you had the Polaroid founder, and a bunch of

156
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,520
these guys studying human genetics with respect to radiation. And Annie Jacobson has uncovered a lot

157
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,480
about Area 51, where they were doing a lot of, you know, human genetic experimentation

158
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,080
vis-a-vis radiation as well. And again, some of these photographs are quite extraordinary.

159
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,000
And when I came across them in dad's old files, I'm like, what the heck are these?

160
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,040
Wow. And they're from the Atomic Energy Commission and they're photographs of

161
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,120
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These are Geiger counters? Is that right? You were telling me last night.

162
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:18,680
This is Hiroshima. Credit, U.S. Air Force. Wow. This is amazing.

163
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:26,760
So that's why he knew a lot at that age. And Carl Compton starts to register the president of MIT

164
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,120
that he's got this kid who's basically holding the paint bucket for his dad. And he knows a lot

165
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:39,960
about photons. And so I think that's where this began. He was identified at a very early age.

166
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:48,120
As someone with a very particular proclivity. And then fast forward, because, you know,

167
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:55,240
I looked at my dad's career. I look back and I'm like, how the heck did you end up at age 27

168
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:02,760
being the joint liaison between the Joint Chiefs and the President of the United States National

169
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,520
Security Council under Bob McNamara and JFK, just as the Cuban Missile Crisis at the beginning?

170
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:15,480
And, you know, dad has an amazing story to tell about what it was like to be in that room

171
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:23,400
as the decisions were being made. And he played a really critical part in preventing a nuclear

172
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,720
catastrophe. That's so amazing. Which is a story I think you should tell. Yeah, I can't wait to

173
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,560
hear. But clearly you had been tracked at a young age. I mean, this is a letter that you're receiving

174
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:40,440
from Oak Ridge National Labs, and it's atomic bomb engineering. So it's clear that they are like,

175
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,720
okay, here's this whiz kid. Let's give him a limited information set, see what he can do with it,

176
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:52,200
and maybe have some sort of initiation path. How you almost, you know, serendipitously and

177
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,840
miraculously wind up at Carl Compton's house holding a paint bucket. I don't quite know. I

178
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:06,120
don't can't explain that. Who is this Carl Compton? Well, he served as the president of MIT

179
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:13,160
from 1930 to 1948. During that time, he also served on Franklin Delano Roosevelt's National

180
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,760
Defense Research Council and worked closely with Vannevar Bush on federally funded scientific

181
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,160
research for the promotion of American military supremacy. At MIT, Compton was heavily involved

182
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:31,160
in the famous Rad Lab and its development of American radar. His top technical aide was John

183
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:37,000
Trump. If you recognize that name, it's because John Trump is the late uncle of our current sitting

184
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,600
president, Donald Trump. And John Trump was charged with investigating Tesla's files that were

185
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:49,240
confiscated by the FBI to see if they'd confer any tactical warfare advantages to the United States.

186
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,360
One of Trump's last interviews was also featured in a documentary on Thomas Townsend Brown's

187
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:00,280
Philadelphia experiment. And I was particularly looking for something which would just be evidence

188
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,760
of a secret weapon, which was a matter of concern to the United States.

189
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,560
But I digress. For the purposes of this conversation with Harold,

190
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:17,480
Carl Compton pops up in UFO history twice. First, you have Robert Sarbach,

191
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,400
former head of Washington National Labs, also one of America's premier nuclear scientists.

192
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:29,480
Sarbach is famously on record saying that UFO secrecy is classified at two levels higher than

193
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:36,600
the hydrogen bomb. But Sarbach also told nuclear engineer and UFO researcher Stanton Friedman

194
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:43,400
that none other than MIT president Carl Compton was briefed on UFO technology at Wright Airfield

195
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:51,000
in 1950. But there are more UFO touch points for Compton. Another researcher in California

196
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,840
named William Steinman had been corresponding with Fred Darwin, the former executive director

197
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:05,400
of the Guided Missile Committee for the DOD's R&D Board from 1949 to 1954. Darwin listed these names

198
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,720
as involved in a special committee on flying saucers at the highest level. Dr. Vannevar Bush,

199
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:19,480
Dr. Lloyd Berkner, Dr. Robert F. Reinhart, Dr. Eric A. Walker, Dr. John von Neumann, and one,

200
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:28,840
Dr. Carl T. Compton. Finally, when government transparency researcher John Greenwald used the

201
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,600
Freedom of Information Act to retrieve Compton's records, he received a reply back in April of

202
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:40,920
2014. Quote-unquote, records which may have been responsive to your request were destroyed

203
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,400
August 30th, 2006.

204
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:51,400
Why would the FBI destroy a file on an innocent university professor? And why would they have a

205
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,200
file on him in the first place? Those are good questions. And how did little Harold Malmgren

206
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,640
somehow end up holding a paint bucket at Carl Compton's house a couple of years after Harold

207
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,760
had written to the Atomic Energy Commission wanting to learn more about the American nuclear

208
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:15,240
program? That might be an even better question. Well, and he had gone on to work with Tom Schelling,

209
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:22,920
who was father of game theory, the application to conflict resolution across many different things,

210
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:30,760
but nuclear, and working with many Nobel Prize winners, including Sir John Hicks at Oxford.

211
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:38,520
And so I think when Kennedy came in, he knew some of the Nobel Prize winners and he asked them,

212
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,760
who's your brightest kid? And dad's name just kept showing up on the list.

213
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,240
It's fascinating. So then, okay, what happens? So you're recognized by Carl Compton,

214
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,080
you have this correspondence with the Atomic Energy Commission. How do you end up from that

215
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,640
situation to the Situation Room during the Cuban Missile Crisis as the youngest person in the room?

216
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:09,480
I'm still finding a reason to trust how that happened. At Yale, I was still a huge athlete

217
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:20,120
and a really top student. I was ranked first along with another person who later became

218
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:28,040
Chief Justice of the Arkansas State Supreme Court. I had moved from physics to economics

219
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,800
because I thought, my parents need help and I get older and I need to do something that makes money.

220
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:43,800
Economics sounds like money. So I got a grant from Yale to go somewhere and I wanted to go to Oxford.

221
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,120
It was a dream. And I went there and really fell in love with it.

222
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:59,960
I didn't really study anything specifically. I went to everything. And then I met a lady there

223
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:09,560
who was American and those things happened. I got pretty attached. And I came back from

224
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:19,640
after my one year grant to Harvard. And after I was partly going through the first term,

225
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,320
Mr. George Bundy, who was then Dean, had me in and he said,

226
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:34,440
we hear you're taking the leave again to go back to Oxford, but we want to offer you something

227
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:45,160
special. We'll give you three years, all expenses, including summer, and all you have to do is write

228
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:51,800
a book. You don't have to attend any classes. If you write the book, we'll almost certainly publish

229
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:59,880
it and that will be your PhD. And this is at Harvard? Yeah. That's a great deal. He said it's

230
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:07,880
a great deal. And I said, yeah, but my brain was somewhat flattered by this girl.

231
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:16,360
But also Oxford offered me, they said, just come here, but we'll take care of you. You can do your

232
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:29,000
PhD here. And so I did that. Married that girl. My mom. And there's always an element of

233
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:43,080
frailty in unexpected ways, in particularly my males. But at Oxford, Sir John Hurt decided,

234
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:51,080
well, he and his wife invited me to dinner. And she explained, she was a public finance expert.

235
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:58,840
So she decided, explained to me, her husband felt I was an original thinker and that they only

236
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:09,240
come along once every 25, 30, 40 years. She said, at Yale, you went deep into mathematical

237
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:21,720
economics. So I told my husband that you got to convince this young man to just dump all that

238
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:32,120
mathematics in a storage shed and start working more fundamentally at behavioral economics.

239
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:44,680
I remember the first paper I gave him was really a moment of insight. I gave him this paper, nine

240
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:52,600
pages roughly, full of math. And he said, this looks very interesting. Come back next week after

241
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:59,800
I read it. Come back next week. He said, don't sit here in the student reception room. Come into my

242
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:10,840
inner chambers. Sit down here by the fire. I thought, is this bad or good? And I began to inflate.

243
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,680
He really thinks I'm good. He said, but you know, it took me an entire week to find it out.

244
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,880
How many people of my caliber do you think in your lifetime are going to spend three or four days

245
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:31,400
of their time trying to understand you? He said, I think this is not the way to make progress.

246
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:42,520
So he said, it's near the end of term. I want you to go in a hole with a big amount of Gibbon's

247
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:50,840
Decline and Fall, which is in several volumes, and read everything you can before the vacation

248
00:29:50,840 --> 00:30:00,840
period is over. So I came back and said, what have you learned? I said, I only got to something.

249
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:08,840
Chapter and whatever. And he said, that's not bad. The reason I want you to read that at a dead run

250
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:16,840
is because you have to know how it was written. Gibbons didn't do it

251
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:26,200
brick by brick. He wrote it at a dead run from his mind and said, you got to learn to do that.

252
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:36,520
You have plenty to say. You know how to say it. So write it that way. Don't stop to see if you can

253
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:46,280
fit it to some model. And so we had a marvelous experience. And then soon afterwards,

254
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,040
he said, there are people you should meet. So some of the best people at

255
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:58,040
Cambridge came to see me. Famous names. And then he said,

256
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:07,240
Hayek, Friedrich von Hayek. I persuaded him to come to Oxford and meet you.

257
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,720
So he came. I spent time with him. For me, I knew who he was. It was very impressive.

258
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:31,240
And then on another occasion, there had been a big debate in the 1920s, going to the 30s,

259
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:41,640
between Ludwig von Mises on behalf of the Austrian capitalism economists and the communist central

260
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:54,040
planet. The opposite was Oscar Langer. Oscar Langer came to Oxford to have dinner with me.

261
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:04,040
We had a fight. Centralization automatically degrades itself because you restrict everybody

262
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:09,080
from innovation, adaptation. Once you do that, there's no change.

263
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,440
So you would be more on the Austrian school side?

264
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,240
Yeah, yes.

265
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:19,960
Okay. I am too. Although I'm far inferior in economics.

266
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:26,440
I'm still the same. I'm totally convinced that China will collapse because of over-centralization.

267
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:36,840
Anyway, by the way, in the 1980s, I was in China with some kind of an SRI

268
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,400
meeting.

269
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,160
The Stanford Research Institute?

270
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:47,480
Yeah. They invited me along. And the senior Chinese, very interesting,

271
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:54,840
years later, said, can we have dinner with you alone? No. Okay. Why not?

272
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:06,360
So three of the most senior economic officials, we had a long dinner. We knew about your work on

273
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:15,960
centralization. Really, how do you know about it? We had your thesis translated, and we talked to

274
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:25,080
Oscar Langer and some other people. We had an argument. I said, over-centralization would

275
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:35,320
bring you destruction. It's impossible. It's too big to manage. Anyway, so going back to

276
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:47,720
Oxford, I finished up there, and there was a bidding war like an NBA or national football,

277
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:58,280
they're bidding graduates. So MIT and Stanford and Harvard and some others, Princeton, offered me a

278
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:09,640
post, and Cornell said, we'll trump the others. We'll offer you a new chair just endowed now,

279
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:17,800
so you can bypass the normal process of seven years from your assistant professor and

280
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,360
associate professor eventually. You can start at the top. So I said, okay, I'll accept.

281
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:41,000
And I came to Cornell with Pippa's mother. Pippa was born in May of that year, and we were living

282
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:49,240
in the house of Nabokov, the Russian author. Wow. He was on leave, and I leased from him.

283
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,680
In Ithaca, New York. Wow.

284
00:34:52,680 --> 00:35:00,600
Yeah, it was an adventure, and he was something impressive. All these fortunate developments

285
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:08,680
happened in my life, anyway. By the way, these also became clues for me later, because I realized

286
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:15,560
Nabokov was said to be a CIA asset. Really?

287
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:25,720
And was used to help use literature as a means of propaganda, and there are lots of stories about

288
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:36,280
the intelligence agencies using Dr. Zhivago as a medium for fomenting opposition within the

289
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,400
Soviet Union. And so I was kind of like, how the heck do we end up in Nabokov's house?

290
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,120
Oh, wow.

291
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:51,400
And maybe the answer was that there was already at that time an intelligence world that in later

292
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,880
years, because of Dad's work in nuclear negotiations, that again, maybe he'd been

293
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:05,000
kind of identified early on. But I would love for you, Dad, to just dive into you are in the

294
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:12,600
situation room. You are down to the last three hours before you all think that you're hitting

295
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:20,040
the nuclear go button. And can you just describe what was it like in that moment,

296
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,080
and how did you avert the nuclear crisis?

297
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,800
A strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment,

298
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,040
on the shipment to Cuba, is being initiated.

299
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:45,000
I was appointed liaison between McNamara and McGrode Bundy and JFK. I mean, pretty critical job.

300
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,560
McNamara's secretary of defense at the time.

301
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:55,880
Yeah. And so, all right, I'm there, and I'm wondering what I'm going to work on. And suddenly

302
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:05,720
the Cuban Missile Crisis unfolds, and I get a call. And Bob wants you to work directly

303
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:15,320
with a small group in the war room. I said, what's the war room? It's where the generals meet and

304
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,840
decide, no, no, no, because they have the weapons, but my house doesn't have them.

305
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,200
So this is Bob McNamara. He wants you to meet.

306
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,600
He brought me to be there in that room as his guy. They would know I'm his guy.

307
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:41,960
And I said, yeah, then that can be easier to hear from this young sport. He said, don't

308
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:49,720
tell them what you think should happen. Ask them a lot of questions. Your job is to slow them down.

309
00:37:51,320 --> 00:38:01,000
Reduce the heat in the room. Everybody can go calm. And if you just keep asking questions and

310
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:11,320
make them think, you'll be surprised how far that goes. And it buys us time. It takes the pressure

311
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:18,200
off from them, because there are some people in that group. I didn't realize it was Curtis LeMay

312
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:28,200
that worried about who wants to go ahead and punish Russia for even trying. So I get started

313
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,640
in that. And after a few days, I got used to the group. They get used to me. They didn't ask me to

314
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:40,280
get the coffee. They treated me like, OK, I belong there. And I didn't say anything to them.

315
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:50,680
I didn't talk down to them. I asked them, how's your wife today? And we got to the

316
00:38:52,280 --> 00:39:01,640
last hours, roughly four hours, when JFK told Khrushchev, we put a quarantine around

317
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:12,600
Cuba. If one of your ships breaks through the quarantine, that will be an act of war,

318
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:23,480
and we will take action, being specified. And among the generals, there were arguments. What

319
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:31,560
should we do? Do we take out the missiles that are in Cuba? Well, we don't know whether some are armed

320
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:42,760
or not. Do we know that they have the ability to do more than we see? Might they start World War III

321
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:51,000
in order to get a step ahead? This was a time of mutually assured destruction. It was really

322
00:39:51,160 --> 00:40:00,120
terrifying, in some sense. And so we end that final hour waiting to see if they were going to stop

323
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:07,960
or not. And there was communication going on. None of us were privy to it between Khrushchev

324
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:17,800
and JFK. And there was one additional element the history books have omitted, the Russian ambassador.

325
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:31,720
The Russian ambassador, Dobrygin, he arrived that year in Washington. He was unique. He wasn't a

326
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:38,360
typical diplomat. He was a member of the Central Committee in Moscow. They sent him to Washington

327
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:50,360
as the highest ranking politician in Moscow. And in that position, he was able to himself talk

328
00:40:51,640 --> 00:41:03,080
with the top people in the Central Committee. Anyway, in those final hours,

329
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:11,240
the agitation level was high. We all sat down after somebody had a coffee break.

330
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:22,920
And one of the senior generals sent a signal that we didn't have cell phones. An aide came in,

331
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:32,600
said, I want you to call Mary, tell her to load the car, get everything ready to go,

332
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:39,640
and drive as fast as you can to Maine to our country place. And then he said, let's resume now,

333
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:45,480
gentlemen. Yeah, it's like literally, Mary, take the kids and get out of here. Like we're about

334
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:52,680
to be at the end. And this is the bit, dad, where it's so important that it's Curtis LeMay

335
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:00,360
who wants to drop Anuk. So maybe Dr. Strangelove wasn't so... It was based on him.

336
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:08,920
Yeah, but let me finish the story. So in the group, I said, gentlemen,

337
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:17,000
all the thinking of the last... ever since the bombers dropped in Japan,

338
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,800
all the thinking is about mutually assured destruction. If we go, we both get obliterated.

339
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:32,520
Does this make any sense to any of us in this room? There must be some degree of action less

340
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:37,960
than that. And they all said, yeah, but we haven't explored that. I said, yeah, we don't have any

341
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,800
calibration, any idea of small steps or ways to convince that we're serious. If we attack Russia,

342
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:56,120
what are we really ready for then? No. Now, if we attack Cuba and Russia thinks

343
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:02,600
it's the first step, that they want to get one step ahead of us by being first actor,

344
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:11,560
well, that would be bad. We can't know what they're thinking, but we have to kind of think

345
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:18,840
about that. Or we may take some step back and say, well, we don't know what they're thinking.

346
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:28,120
But we have to kind of think about that. Or we may take some step and they fire a little bit

347
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:34,760
at us, but a little bit makes us pissed off. And then we decide to unload everything.

348
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,240
First, LeMay is in this group saying, my strategic bombers are ready.

349
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:48,280
You know, we had all these missiles, but- His nickname is Bombs Away, LeMay.

350
00:43:48,280 --> 00:44:00,360
Bombs Away. No, I had no idea what a miserable, mean, arrogant guy this was. I mean, there was

351
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:08,680
nothing written a lot about him other than he was super aggressive. Is he chief of staff of the

352
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,600
Air Force at this time? Strategic Air Command.

353
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,600
Strategic Air Command. Okay.

354
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:22,120
And it's important that you mention how he says, my guys, we keep setting them up to the

355
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,600
point of no return. Yeah, that's what I meant to say.

356
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,720
He said in the room to all these other generals and admirals,

357
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:42,520
you can't imagine the morale problem I have. Every day I send my boys out there, they reach

358
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:50,520
the point of no return. If they keep going, they'll run out of fuel. And he said I have to order

359
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:58,280
them back. He said the morale is really, they're ready. He's playing with millions of people's

360
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:03,800
lives to make sure that the morale of his units are okay.

361
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,960
Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair must, but I do say no more than 10 to

362
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:17,960
20 million kill tops, depending on the breaks. He said that and every man in the room looked

363
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:25,880
down and laughed. They didn't want to eyeball it. I didn't hear that.

364
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,880
It's like if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all. I mean, he's also, for the

365
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:35,160
context for the audience, he was in charge of the 509th Atomic Bomber Squadron in Roswell,

366
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,840
New Mexico that was responsible for the bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

367
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:50,840
And he was in charge of all the firebombing in Germany. His idea of enemy is obliterate them.

368
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,840
Anyway, I didn't know what I was up against, but you know, it might have scared me, but it

369
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:04,280
didn't. So I said, well, let's, all the rest of us, let's contemplate the options. We slowly

370
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:13,320
thought. And then it turned out that we got word that the Russians stopped the boats

371
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:25,880
at the point of quarantine. And I said, can we agree that we should back off?

372
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:33,080
We should back off. And Hiroshima, they said, no way. We've got to teach them a lesson that

373
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:39,640
they're messing with us. They have to have something to remember. We need some surgical

374
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:47,400
strikes on Russia. It doesn't have to be population-oriented, but we need to make it

375
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:57,960
painful. And I said, but that leads us back into, will they think that this is just the beginning

376
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:05,320
of Armageddon? We simply haven't had a discussion. We have no communication channel to deal with that.

377
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:15,720
It doesn't make sense. It seems to me backing off for now and letting the discussions continue.

378
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:25,080
How do we avoid this being the preference? And all the generals agreed, and the one that had

379
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:31,080
called his wife, pushed the button, his aide came in and said, call Mary back. Tell her, I know this

380
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:42,760
for sure. But you also made a suggestion that if you hit Moscow, there wouldn't be anybody to

381
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:50,520
negotiate with. And further, if you let it leak to the Russians that you wouldn't hit Moscow,

382
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,800
maybe they wouldn't hit Washington. And everybody in the room just loved that.

383
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,520
And if I remember correctly, you kind of rhetorically back them into a corner

384
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,720
where you say, what would be your prime target first? And then they say, Moscow. And then you

385
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,720
say, oh, if it's Moscow, then you can't talk to anybody in Moscow. There's nobody to negotiate

386
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:17,080
with. That's been through them. I said, it's madness. If you're going to start something and

387
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:24,120
you need to stop, in that system, there's only one point of decision. If you hit Moscow, there's no

388
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:31,640
one to talk to. And then that's at that point, right, LeMay storms out and gets all angry,

389
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:43,400
is that right? He literally got up, slammed his papers down. I refuse to run with this.

390
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:50,280
That man was really maniac, but I have to tell you, I did not buckle.

391
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,560
No, I know you didn't.

392
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:03,240
Now, he had, by the way, just before that, raised the voting level to DEF CON 2.

393
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,680
It was not approved by the president.

394
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,160
Really?

395
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:07,960
He did it.

396
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,040
Unapproved. He raised the warning level of DEF CON 2.

397
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:16,520
He seemed to have that power. I mean, we were surprised, but anyway, he may have had that power.

398
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,160
Interesting.

399
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:24,280
Anyway, I mean, when I look back and think, Jesus, I stood in the way of this

400
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:34,440
historic big Obama. I mean, he could have stood up and tried to beat me up. I mean,

401
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,920
that kind of person. When he stormed out, what a relief to the whole group.

402
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:49,080
But it was the first in a series of evident clashes between him and JFK.

403
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:58,200
It was personal. Somehow, it all radiated. This is not about Russians only. Something

404
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,920
was going on in his head. We learned later about some of the other things.

405
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,000
And you had the Bay of Pigs before that as well,

406
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:17,640
which is this crucial juncture where I think, actually, Eisenhower left his second term

407
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,440
slightly skeptical of Dulles. I think, initially, he was willing to go along with his plans.

408
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:29,000
JFK didn't quite know what to think. After the Bay of Pigs, it was really this clear

409
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:37,880
rupture where you had the CIA, quote unquote, deep state. They had their own plans and they

410
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:45,160
really wanted to oust Castro and Guevara. And then you had JFK, and he felt like this whole

411
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,480
thing was just botched. And they send these Cuban exiles in there to kind of create this

412
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,600
revolution. But it's kind of half done, and the exiles are actually left kind of isolated.

413
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,440
Doesn't quite work out. And then you have this rift where you have people like Curtis LeMay

414
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:05,000
and Alan Dulles in complete loggerheads with JFK. JFK gets angry. He says, I want to scatter the CIA

415
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,880
to the winds. The president's saying, he's going to bring the CIA into a thousand pieces.

416
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:17,400
Is that roughly right? Yeah, that's right. So this was the prelude, this Victorian,

417
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:28,120
to what became a flash over how do we respond when we have an excuse. And Curtis LeMay said,

418
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:35,960
at least let me send my bombers after some strategic facilities of the Russians.

419
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:46,040
But how do you sort out, for the Russians' point of view, bombers coming at us? We don't know

420
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:53,080
their trajectory. We can't study that. It's not like a missile. Once it's fired, you know where

421
00:51:53,080 --> 00:52:02,280
it's going. So high risk. And I said, this doesn't make sense. So everybody agreed except

422
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:10,520
Curtis LeMay, and he blew up when he thought he was going to dominate. Well, I mean, I didn't know

423
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:21,960
that this was a moment of history and that somehow my arguments won. But on the other hand, I thought,

424
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:28,920
this is why McNamara sent me down here. Well, that seems, it's such an act of genius to him

425
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:35,560
on his part to call you in as a 27-year-old to stagnate these sort of more aggressive,

426
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:41,320
you know, guys like Curtis LeMay. And you think of the way Robert McNamara is depicted in like,

427
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:46,520
you know, Errol Morris's Fog of War, just as an example. And he's seen as this sort of warmonger.

428
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,880
And this, you know, cuts completely against that. McNamara, do you mean to say

429
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:55,880
that instead of killing 100,000, burning 100,000 Japanese civilians in that one night,

430
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:01,400
we should have burned a lesser number or none? And then had our soldiers across the beaches in

431
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,600
Tokyo and been slaughtered in the tens of thousands? Is that what you're proposing?

432
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:12,840
Yeah, yeah. No, his instruction. He said, these guys are coming in that room.

433
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:17,880
There's several of them have sidearms that are fully loaded with the safety off.

434
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,280
Oh, my God.

435
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:27,400
They're hot to go. He said, your task is to lower the temperature.

436
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,160
Yeah, wow.

437
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:34,840
And see if you can't stretch it out. Give us time to burn something out.

438
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,840
What foresight on his part.

439
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:51,480
Johnston Island was the center of launch and experimental activity for the 1962

440
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,640
High Altitude Weapon Effects testing termed Operation Fishbowl.

441
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:07,240
Running from April to October of 1962, Operation Dominic was a classified American program

442
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:14,280
conducting 31 nuclear test explosions in the Marshall Islands. These tests were designed

443
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,640
to study the effects of nuclear detonations in high altitudes in space and near space.

444
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:26,840
One of these tests, Starfish Prime, created an electromagnetic pulse that extended over 1,400

445
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:32,760
kilometers, knocked out streetlights, triggered burglar alarms, and caused electrical surges in

446
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:38,680
nearby Hawaii. It also produced an artificial aurora visible from Hawaii to New Zealand,

447
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:43,880
and it even created a man-made radiation belt similar to the Van Allen belt that destroyed

448
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,200
similar to the Van Allen belt that destroyed multiple satellites.

449
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:57,000
The last few tests of this series were the Bluegill tests, which involved a unique X-ray-based

450
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,440
missile defense system, and Harold was put in charge of doing all of the cost assessments

451
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:07,000
for this test. Tell us about the Bluegill Triple Prime test.

452
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:16,680
Well, I arrived in Washington summer of 62. In 61, there were two high-level

453
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:27,720
tests, an incoming missile and an interceptor fired up to see if they could stop it.

454
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:35,640
Those two tests failed. Summer of 62, I arrived, and first I'm in the middle of this

455
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:42,040
missile crisis, and then before it's barely over,

456
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:51,960
hell, would you set up a small group that will give you the people to devise

457
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:59,320
the outlines of an anti-missile system so that we can start anticipating for the future.

458
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,080
I said, yeah, that's something that DARPA should do with a

459
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:14,440
bastard. They said, no, no, what we want is a concise top and back of the envelope calculation.

460
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:24,520
What should be the elements of it? What would it cost, and how much would it cost for the enemy to

461
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:32,120
offset it? I said, okay, I'll take it on, and I got that assignment. I'm thinking, holy cow,

462
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:39,880
this is huge, and they gave me these people in the Joint Chiefs of Staff

463
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,440
in the Reconciliation Valuation Group. Who am I talking to, these guys?

464
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,720
Missile defense was a major priority for the United States in the heart of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

465
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:57,720
While American offensive nuclear capabilities were ahead of the Soviets, the U.S. still

466
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:04,280
didn't have precise ways of defending against a nuclear attack. But there were some novel ideas

467
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:10,760
in missile defense at the time. In 1961, the RAND Corporation wrote a report called

468
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:16,120
Some New Considerations Concerning the Nuclear Test Ban, which highlighted the susceptibility

469
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:25,720
of the U.S. ICBM reentry vehicles to high-energy x-rays. To say this is a piece of steel and it's

470
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:32,440
in outer space. If you impinge high-energy x-rays on this side, so what that does is

471
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:39,480
blows chunks off the inside at hypersonic speeds. This novel insight made its way into the Operation

472
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:45,560
Dominic Marshall Islands tests. Here's where it gets interesting. These x-ray emissions could

473
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,040
also take out surrounding UFOs.

474
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:24,840
This new project, the same report that went to JFK. Now you can assume JFK, it was read by

475
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:34,600
McGeorge Bundy at his job. I knew it must have been read by McNamara and John McNaughton,

476
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:43,560
the general counsel, if they were all interactive. And almost certainly LBJ, because vice president

477
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:55,720
anybody. Lo and behold, they dashed down. I said, wait a minute, I'm puzzled here.

478
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:07,960
In the report you've given me, you have videos of taking down this incoming missile with

479
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:18,840
an especially enhanced x-ray projection system. But when you did that, you noticed that there

480
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:28,920
had been some object that had appeared on the screen and joined and tagged along following

481
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,600
the incoming missile down.

482
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:38,200
By the way, can I just interject? Because for me, I kind of got my dad a little up to speed on

483
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:44,760
the whole, why is Congress pursuing non-human intelligence? Why are they passing whistleblower

484
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:51,720
legislation? And so when we started talking about this, so he says there's this orb around

485
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:59,080
the missile. And I'm like, so didn't you think that was weird? And I realized that actually,

486
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:05,880
I think that the people of that generation were so accustomed to seeing them that they

487
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,680
didn't, they knew it wasn't Russian. They knew it wasn't, in those days, it was never going to be

488
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:17,960
Chinese. They knew it wasn't a threat. So dad said, yeah, we called it a tag along, a tag along.

489
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:24,920
Like, didn't you ask what it was? And, and he's sort of replied in such a way that I realized

490
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:33,080
nobody asked any questions at that time. And they were probably encouraged not to ask any questions.

491
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:46,760
That's what you would call them tag alongs. Wow. What else? So that it's so casual that you just

492
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:51,640
call them tag alongs. I think they were so inured to seeing them. They were like tag along.

493
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:59,080
The UFO nuclear connection was a complete open secret among top military brass in the 50s and

494
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:05,960
60s. In a 1952 Look Magazine article titled The Hunt for the Flying Saucer, Chief UFO

495
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:11,240
Investigator for the Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt is quoted saying that many of the sightings

496
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:17,320
reported had originated at one atomic weapons related site or another all around the country.

497
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:25,640
In fact, while the Operation Dominic tests were going on in 1962, an Avco Mark IV reentry vehicle

498
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:31,480
attached to an Atlas 8F missile was being tested at Cape Canaveral in the Atlantic missile range

499
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:37,800
in September. This is the footage that was taken from that test.

500
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:43,400
At the 4 minute and 40 second mark in the video, an object appears to phase itself into existence

501
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:50,440
alongside the reentry vehicle, which is traveling at 20,000 feet per second or Mach 18. The official

502
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:56,680
U.S. Air Force NASA post flight report even states that the object's quote unquote origin or

503
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:03,320
identification could not be determined. The object appears to be in the middle of the

504
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:19,720
The very next month, after this Atlas test at Cape Canaveral, the Atomic Energy Commission

505
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:25,480
conducted the Bluegill Triple Prime test in October of 1962 in the Marshall Islands.

506
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:31,880
The point is, this was the backdrop for the Bluegill tests. One in which the military,

507
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:37,320
scientific, and political elite in America were well aware of the connection between

508
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:45,480
UFOs and nuclear weapons. Anyway, when the incoming missile

509
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:57,240
reacted to this blast of x-ray, at that moment the report said this appeared to knock down

510
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:15,000
the attack alarm. I didn't react with shock. I thought, let's find out what that was.

511
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:26,360
Was there a recovery? Yes, the Navy had recovered but fell. Tell me about it. Oh, we can't do that.

512
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:35,320
You have need to know about the incoming missile and the test, but not about the attack alarm.

513
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:41,880
Why not? Just to be clear, you've got all the cue clearances, right? Not some of them. You've got

514
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:47,240
all the cue clearances. And they say, no, you don't need to know. Why? Well, I had a blanket

515
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:56,520
cue clearance. Besides top secret and all that stuff, I had presidential clearance for the highest

516
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:03,400
level stuff that comes to the president. I mean, I had been given everything, but especially that

517
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:10,520
they gave me a blanket cue clearance. Cue was for anything nuclear weapons. Why was that separate?

518
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:19,800
Because that was managed by the Atomic Energy Commission. That was in law separate. But it's

519
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:25,640
so interesting because you hear that UFO secrecy was sort of bound up in atomic secrecy and the

520
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:30,760
Atomic Energy Commission. The guys that were involved in Manhattan were overlaying the same

521
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:36,680
ecosystem of secrecy in some of the same ways to protect stuff that they were protecting our nuclear

522
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:42,840
secret. And you don't even have access to the UFO stuff with all of your cue clearances.

523
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:54,200
Two KC-135 aircrafts in proximity of the test were gathering footage. Australian intelligence

524
01:04:54,200 --> 01:05:00,200
analyst Geoffrey Cruikshank, who's done the most in-depth analysis of this test, calls these two

525
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:06,920
pieces of footage Kettle 1 and Kettle 2. A bright fiery object tumbles out from within

526
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:13,720
the nuclear fireball. You believe that that is some kind of craft?

527
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:22,200
Just like the one that was following the Atlas 8F test, but this time it was a real warhead.

528
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:28,440
You can see clearly from the Kettle 1 footage of the nuclear blast, an unidentified flying object

529
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:35,800
tumble out of the nuclear fireball. The official report written about this test at the time was

530
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:40,680
written by the Flight Dynamics Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The report

531
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:45,160
tries to explain the presence of this second thermal source in the footage. Quote-unquote,

532
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:50,280
there is no evidence to indicate that even the closest pod was ever immersed in the fireball,

533
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,800
so it definitely wasn't one of the instrumentation pods on the missile.

534
01:05:53,800 --> 01:06:01,880
If that's not weird enough, these videos were declassified to the public in 1998.

535
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:06,200
At the declassification review, the Defense Special Weapons Agency,

536
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:13,480
led by Dr. Byron L. Ristvet, applied a large white triangle to the footage, sanitizing it,

537
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:18,120
right where you can see the object tumbling out of the plume in the Kettle 1 footage.

538
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:24,280
There's well-known animosity between Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore Labs. Lawrence Livermore

539
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:32,360
ran one aircraft, Los Alamos ran the other. The reason why the Kettle 1 footage was declassified

540
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:38,840
and Kettle 2 wasn't was simply a personal difference in what should remain classified

541
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:45,240
and what shouldn't. Then on October 21, 2023, when Jeffrey Cruikshank sent a mandatory

542
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:51,880
declassification review request to the Department of Energy asking them to declassify this Kettle 2

543
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:56,840
footage which had been sanitized, the Department of Energy responded saying that they were unable

544
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:01,640
to locate the footage. They were literally saying they lost the footage of one of their most important

545
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:07,720
high-altitude nuclear tests. And maybe all you need to know is that Bluegill Triple Prime is the only

546
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:13,480
one of the Operation Fishbowl nuclear tests where any portion of the released video is still

547
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:20,040
sanitized and classified to this day. And tellingly, look at what happened when a Freedom

548
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:25,000
of Information Act request was sent to the National Nuclear Security Administration

549
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:31,480
generally around these 1962 Operation Dominic tests. The exact request was for all records

550
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:39,880
that quote-unquote mention or relate to Starfish Prime and any of the following UFO, AP, UAV, AAV,

551
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:45,480
any acronym used by the Atomic Energy Commission at the time for unidentified flying objects.

552
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:51,720
The National Nuclear Security Administration responded. The letter back in June of 2022 reads,

553
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:56,680
it was determined that an additional review of your case by the subject matter expert with

554
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:05,400
jurisdiction regarding responsive records was required. First of all, who are the subject

555
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:10,760
matter experts on UFOs? Second of all, this seems like a tacit admission that there are

556
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:16,680
responsive records that apply to this Freedom of Information Act request that specifically ask for

557
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:23,320
information on UFOs. Finally, we have an eyewitness of the Bluegill Triple Prime test who is alive

558
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:29,720
today, a former Navy sailor named David Noble Whitecrow. He's spoken to UFO investigator Richard

559
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:36,120
and look at what he told Dolan. The witness was a man named David. He was part of what was called

560
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:45,080
Operation Dominic. He was aboard a ship called the USS Finch 19 miles south southwest of Johnson

561
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:52,280
Island or Johnson Atoll. The date is October 26, 1962. At 9.59 a.m. they launched this missile.

562
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:55,800
Suddenly he hears on the loudspeaker the voice of the ship's captain saying,

563
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:04,360
everyone below deck other than a few essential personnel and they're preparing for damage control.

564
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:09,160
After 15 minutes, an officer goes down in there and he selects about a dozen of these guys,

565
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:14,920
including David, and they're ordered to look directly forward toward the horizon

566
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:22,600
and they were not allowed to have any conversation. So after some time, I don't know how long,

567
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:31,480
the officer in charge orders them to look 10 degrees off the starboard bow. So at this point,

568
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:36,360
this is a direct quote from David. I wrote this entire thing down. He said to me, lo and behold,

569
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:43,000
what appeared in the sky, what I saw was a huge cigar shaped object coming toward us

570
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,800
at 10 degrees and about 15 to 20 degrees off the horizon.

571
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:57,240
And what about the most senior official present at Operation Bluegill Triple Prime?

572
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:02,360
If you're a head honcho and you see a UFO tumble out of the sky, surely you can't just engage in

573
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:10,200
business as usual. Well, the logs of a nearby Navy ship, the USS Summit County on 26 October 1961,

574
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:17,480
refer to a SOPA or a senior officer present afloat being on board the ship. That officer was General

575
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:23,000
Alfred Starbird, the Joint Task Force Eight commander of Operation Dominic. He was positioned

576
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,520
around 15 nautical miles from surface zero of Bluegill Triple Prime, which is the closest

577
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:34,120
allowable distance by the range safety officer. William Ogle, the Los Alamos J Division weapons

578
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:39,720
design chief was General Starbird's deputy for Operation Dominic. Ogle writes that General Starbird

579
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:45,640
left Johnston Island at 4 a.m. the night of Operation Bluegill Triple Prime. Starbird went

580
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:51,320
from the deck of the Summit County ship to taking off on a jet from Johnston Island in under four

581
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:55,880
hours. There were still very important tests to go, but Starbird apparently needed to leave

582
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:00,360
immediately, maybe because of this successful UFO tag-along shoot down.

583
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:10,200
What they said is that your project designation was this, you know, anti-ballistic mishap,

584
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:21,480
but you, we didn't anticipate this unidentified object, but it's not part of your designation,

585
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:32,600
so I said that's bullshit. So I said I need to know what you learned. Now I'm sure in different

586
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:38,120
words that's what came out of the White House to the people running the test who were

587
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:47,880
under the jurisdiction of the Atomic Energy Commission, under Lawrence Gies, who was in

588
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:54,600
charge of all this stuff. He was head of the Albuquerque Division of the Atomic Energy

589
01:11:54,600 --> 01:12:00,920
Commission, but he was running everything here beside everything that had to do with Los Alamos

590
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:09,240
and high-level tests. And he's randomly Jeff Bezos' maternal grandfather through adoption.

591
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:09,720
Amazing.

592
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:27,400
It explains a lot. Jeff Bezos talked about in some of his earlier reminiscences

593
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:32,600
to reporters. He spent all his summers with his grandfather.

594
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,480
Interesting. Really?

595
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:35,980
Yes.

596
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:43,240
His grandfather had a farm, so I'm sure he had several summers of space.

597
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:50,520
And now he's got Blue Origin. It's so fine. It's just another point in the direction that

598
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,000
rocketry is not what it seems.

599
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:02,120
Right. So two things happened. I pressed hard. You know, you have to let me know what took place.

600
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:07,400
So they said, well, for that you have to come down to Los Alamos.

601
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,680
You pressed hard with Lawrence Gies, and he said I want to know?

602
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,680
I didn't know him that I was talking to.

603
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,080
Okay, but somebody at the Atomic Energy Commission.

604
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:20,600
I said, you know, I need to know. I'm going to decide what I need to know.

605
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:27,560
Just to back up, so you go out to Los Alamos, you get briefed, you meet Lawrence Gies,

606
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:35,800
and like literally a couple of weeks later, suddenly JFK, LBJ, and their teams are

607
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:42,680
going to Los Alamos. So I asked the question, Dad, how often does a president of the United States

608
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,640
go to Los Alamos? And the answer is never.

609
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:51,800
So what was so extraordinary that they all suddenly rush out there?

610
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,880
And this is what you have great insight into.

611
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:00,040
It was about the tagalong. That's what they wanted to know about.

612
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:04,840
They weren't all fascinated by the tagalong itself.

613
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:10,360
So when you came out two weeks before them, what did you find? What did they tell you?

614
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:19,320
I met Lawrence Gies. He said, I have this letter saying that I can brief you.

615
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:26,600
I said, thank you, because he said, well, the test details are controlled by naval intelligence.

616
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:34,280
It was interesting. He said, they don't share everything with the Navy Department.

617
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:44,360
They are an autonomous entity. They are more secure than any other intelligence agency.

618
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:47,960
It's the oldest intelligence agency in the U.S., in the 1890s.

619
01:14:47,960 --> 01:15:00,040
Yeah, well, he said, just be aware, the mighty CIA is not on their fully approved list to circulate.

620
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:05,480
So I can talk about that on another occasion.

621
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:13,160
But anyway, so I said, well, what am I here to find out?

622
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:17,640
He said, well, he reached for some stuff sitting on his desk.

623
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,680
These are things that have come down.

624
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:32,280
So you're looking at like material, anomalous material?

625
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:32,680
Yeah.

626
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,320
Debris?

627
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:33,880
Yeah.

628
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,040
But debris or images?

629
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:37,320
Debris.

630
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:43,480
Wow, that's amazing.

631
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,760
See what it feels like.

632
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,640
What did it feel like?

633
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,480
What color was it?

634
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:17,880
The color of something in space.

635
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,640
What's the color of something in space?

636
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:30,360
Depends on the light in the room or the light in the camera.

637
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:33,800
Was it heavy?

638
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:44,520
Yeah, the objects were like, I mean, I picked them up.

639
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,680
They didn't, I didn't put them down.

640
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,880
They went through the heavens.

641
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:00,920
If you had been there without knowing how it was retrieved, would you think that it was at all

642
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,480
different than like random rocks or something?

643
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,000
You didn't know how it was retrieved.

644
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:15,960
But he said, no, this is some of, he said, I have it on my desk just as an example.

645
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:22,840
I mean, he didn't say it for visitors, but whatever reason he had it there.

646
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,400
Was it emitting alpha, beta, gamma radiation, anything like that?

647
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:33,320
I don't know, I don't know if he, he must have known it was safe.

648
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:36,120
I mean, had all this instrumentation around.

649
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:44,120
Anyway, so I, you know, I just, what have we learned?

650
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:51,000
Because it does pertain to designing a missile system.

651
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,400
What kinds of things can interfere with it?

652
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,520
Or might emulate?

653
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,800
We just need to know more.

654
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,280
Who else is studying this?

655
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:11,400
We need to know about knowledge in other, in other quarters, China or wherever, Russia.

656
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,720
We feared Russian science more than China at that time.

657
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:31,880
Anyway, he explained though that this is not the first case of other unidentified

658
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,400
objects or phenomena.

659
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,560
There's a history.

660
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:42,920
Now he didn't go into the history with me, he just said, do your research.

661
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:50,680
And I said, so you're telling me anyway, but the Navy says I can't know, yes.

662
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:57,800
He said yes, but probably you saw the original.

663
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:06,200
My bet is that that part of the test, the video will have been scrubbed.

664
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,320
Which was, but.

665
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:15,960
And he repeated, that's Navy intelligence, they're another, they live in their own world.

666
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:21,240
Sometimes they think they're even more powerful than we are, but.

667
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,640
Do they still live in their own world?

668
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:25,580
Yes.

669
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,560
That's what everybody says.

670
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:32,920
There are a few key details of this story that fill in some gaps

671
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,720
that Harold relayed to Pippa before he passed.

672
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:46,920
Malmgren confirmed that the entire bluegill shootdown was an attempt to down a UFO.

673
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:53,240
Malmgren explicitly told this to Pippa, his daughter, and Jeffrey Cruikshank.

674
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:57,480
He also told this to Senate intelligence staffer Kirk McConnell, who I interviewed.

675
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:05,960
What Malmgren reported that he'd been told directly by Bissell is that we downed a UFO

676
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:10,280
that was monitoring, closely monitoring that test, and it tumbled into the ocean

677
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,200
and that the Navy picked it up.

678
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:15,880
So the American military knew they could bait UFOs with nukes

679
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:19,000
and destabilize their flight paths with EMPs.

680
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,280
See, EMPs disrupt local magnetic fields.

681
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,480
It would even locally disrupt the magnetosphere of the earth.

682
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:35,480
If you're flying at incredible speeds in a UFO, you probably need to use some form of

683
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:36,600
quantum sensing.

684
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:40,600
This would allow you to use the magnetosphere of the earth in order to navigate.

685
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,880
Birds even do this.

686
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:47,720
They use avian cryptochromes to quantum sense the magnetic field of the earth and navigate home.

687
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:52,040
This form of precision sensing would be necessary in order to navigate a UFO.

688
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,880
So when you disrupt the local magnetic field, you could cause a UFO to spin out,

689
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:00,600
lose control, and drop out of the air.

690
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:06,840
Also, UFO propulsion likely requires megavolt range electricity and extremely strong electric

691
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:12,200
field strength over long periods of time, which would require a power source that far

692
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,600
surpasses traditional fuel or batteries.

693
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,320
I think UFOs have a nuclear propulsion source.

694
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:22,120
If the X-ray-induced shockwave from the bluegill payload would disrupt the plutonium pit of an

695
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:27,080
incoming nuclear warhead, it would also probably disrupt the power source of a UFO.

696
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:35,320
The second missing detail here is that when Harold was holding the UFO pieces Lawrence

697
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:39,400
Geiss had given him, they seemed to telepathically communicate with him.

698
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:42,520
He heard words in his head when he felt the pieces.

699
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:48,200
This is a very common trope in UFO world when it comes to people handling material firsthand.

700
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:53,000
Malmgren forgot the exact words, but he felt like they were important and that the material

701
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,960
may have implanted ideas in his subconscious.

702
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:01,480
He also apparently thought that this was a test that Lawrence Geiss had given him.

703
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:05,560
He wanted to see if Harold would have this mental reaction to the pieces.

704
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,480
Harold apparently passed.

705
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:12,600
Once Harold passed Lawrence Geiss' test and realized there was far more to this tag-long

706
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:17,720
UFO phenomenon than met the eye, Malmgren had clearly graduated from his role as the

707
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,720
missile cost assessment guy.

708
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,800
He needed to get fully read in.

709
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:26,920
That's when he received a full briefing on otherworldly technologies by Richard Bissell.

710
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,400
Who is Richard Bissell?

711
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:43,320
Okay, so a few months after this series of episodes, Missile Crisis, Los Alamos,

712
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,880
Richard Bissell called me up and said,

713
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:52,040
I'd like to spend some time talking to you.

714
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:58,280
Maybe Friday afternoons after work would be good.

715
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,680
I said, sure.

716
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,720
I knew who he was.

717
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:12,840
He was Deputy Director of CIA, and he was in the news a lot because he had been

718
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:17,640
the one who helped Kentworth develop the U-2.

719
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:25,240
And Area 51 at the time was an atomic testing site,

720
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:29,240
and he thought it'd be a good idea to test the U-2 basically right next door.

721
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:29,740
Yeah.

722
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:37,560
So Bissell, I knew he was at the center of all the scientific technology stuff.

723
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,920
I didn't know at that time.

724
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:42,440
His ill fortune was that he was in charge of the

725
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,200
Invade Cuba Bay of Pigs operation, too.

726
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:55,160
Anyway, I knew he was somebody with considerable scope of knowledge

727
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:01,880
and obviously strong enough to run a big part of the empire of CIA.

728
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:08,760
So I sat down, brought a bottle of whiskey out and said,

729
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,960
we don't have to drink all of it this year.

730
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,920
He said, I've talked to everyone around you.

731
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:26,200
You were one of the best kids, but I was told you were the youngest

732
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,440
because you came in a little bit after the others

733
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:32,520
and also that most of them are four or five years older.

734
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:41,480
But you were the star in terms of agility and ability to work

735
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,720
with the top level people without friction.

736
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:50,040
And otherwise you were an obnoxious, you know, smart ass.

737
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:55,800
So he said, you're almost certainly on a curve

738
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,040
where you continue to be at that level.

739
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,640
So there are things you need to know.

740
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,760
And then he went into quite a bit.

741
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:15,000
But it was not only about what we still were calling UFOs at that time,

742
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:24,520
but it was about CIA operations worldwide, the complexity.

743
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:36,040
Some times when the president and CIA were not working in concert.

744
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:41,720
But it happens when you have a big system like that.

745
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,560
It develops a life of its own.

746
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:50,200
What did he say about UFOs and other world technology?

747
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:55,080
And then what did he say about CIA's global nature of their operation?

748
01:25:55,160 --> 01:26:02,120
Well, it all went down simply to they were opposed to anything

749
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,600
which threatened their control.

750
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:13,560
And these unidentified UFOs, we didn't have the UAP word yet.

751
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:20,360
They presented forces that were beyond CIA's knowledge or control.

752
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:28,840
And they interfered perhaps with what CIA was doing with private industry.

753
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:37,160
There was a lot of interaction between Lockheed Martin and CIA where...

754
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:41,320
They would show up around specific atomic testing

755
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,120
or around specific technology development or...

756
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,120
Many types of technology development.

757
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:53,560
So it's almost like the UFOs are more...

758
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,240
It's not just the atomic connection.

759
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:59,640
They're generically attracted to the tip of the spear as far as tech development.

760
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,320
That's at the heart of it.

761
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:04,760
Yeah, which is if you read the three body problem

762
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:09,320
by this amazing Chinese science fiction trilogy.

763
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,400
I saw the movie.

764
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:15,080
Yeah, it seems like something like that is almost the case

765
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,600
according to Richard Bissell.

766
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,400
Wow.

767
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,360
Yeah.

768
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:19,640
And so what does he say?

769
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:22,840
He briefs you on quote unquote other world technologies.

770
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:29,720
That to me belies almost human knowledge of these technologies.

771
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,280
Not just like these things are randomly showing up

772
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,040
when we're making advanced technology.

773
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,920
He said, this is real.

774
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:43,560
We don't know these phenomena.

775
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:51,160
Also, we don't know what the Russians and Chinese and anyone else knows.

776
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,320
That itself is threatening.

777
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:02,600
No, at that time China was not as threatening to us as Russia.

778
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:08,760
We always overrated Russia in my judgment.

779
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:20,440
And we underrated the Chinese obsession to focus in on something very specific,

780
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:23,080
which was the technology race.

781
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:34,840
But anyway, it just bothered me to know that there are all these conflicting

782
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:45,560
forces of power in play, and that they had influence on leadership in many countries,

783
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,080
not just Washington.

784
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:58,680
And it tends to run deep into local politics, depending on where the interests were.

785
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:07,880
Now, he didn't mention Arkansas, but when I reflect back, it probably was on his mind.

786
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,640
Why am I not on the front page of the paper

787
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:21,400
at Ryan Airport or any other airport with a load of dope, with a load of guns?

788
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:33,880
Did Richard Bissell know what was going on all along, that the Bluegill test was actually

789
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:37,880
always intended to be a directed energy-based UFO shoot down?

790
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:45,560
Well, tellingly, Harold told Pippa on his deathbed and off air that the CIA and Atomic

791
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:51,560
Energy Commission got the very idea of shooting down UFOs with directed energy

792
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:56,920
from an extraterrestrial being that survived the Roswell crash in 1947.

793
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:05,800
This being was apparently the sole survivor of that crash.

794
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:14,120
Harold even told Pippa that later in his career, he saw the video of this creature being interviewed.

795
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:19,640
And there's a direct link between the Bluegill Triple Prime tests

796
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:24,600
and Star Wars or the Strategic Defense Initiative that later took place in the 80s.

797
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:30,600
You see, the Bluegill Triple Prime tests inspired Edward Teller's X-ray-based Excalibur designs,

798
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:36,280
which formed the basis of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as Star Wars.

799
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:42,040
Star Wars involved a massive network of directed energy weapons for missile defense.

800
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:47,720
It also involved satellite tracking, an immaculate constellation, if you will,

801
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,200
for UFO shoot downs and tracking.

802
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:56,200
This of course begs the question, was Star Wars always dual use and intended for shooting down

803
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,120
and quarantining UAP?

804
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:03,320
And if these very concepts came from the sole surviving being from the Roswell crash,

805
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:08,040
it begs the very important question, are we involved in some sort of bizarre

806
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,120
extraterrestrial proxy war?

807
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:12,200
Ultimately, one can only speculate.

808
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:16,280
But it is important to note that before he briefed Malmgren,

809
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:19,240
Richard Bissell had to have known about all of this.

810
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:24,840
Remember, at the time he was deputy director of plans for the entire CIA,

811
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:29,240
and he would go on to become deputy director for the entire organization,

812
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,600
it's number two.

813
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:35,320
So he was likely well aware of this interview of the surviving being at Roswell.

814
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:42,360
Bissell also founded Area 51 in 1955, and he'd strategically placed it at the Nevada test site

815
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:45,800
where hundreds of atomic tests were occurring in the early 50s.

816
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:50,520
So he had to have known about the UFO nuclear connection.

817
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:58,440
Bissell likely also understood the secret UFO-related intentions of the bluegill tests all along.

818
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,400
But Harold goes deeper.

819
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:11,320
He implies that Bissell knows about this other layer of reality,

820
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:15,960
a form of sort of extraterrestrial exopolitics that needed to be managed

821
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:18,680
by elements of the U.S. government for decades.

822
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:27,240
Do you think Richard Bissell sort of knew that you were sort of an heir to him

823
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,960
in sort of a more like spiritual sense or something?

824
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:44,360
Very spiritual, and he was looking for someone who was somehow connected.

825
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:57,400
Whatever was happening with other worldly forces.

826
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:12,360
Yeah, I'm reading about them all the time.

827
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:24,280
Yeah, what else did Richard Bissell tell you?

828
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:27,160
He said this didn't start last week.

829
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,440
This has been going on.

830
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:34,040
He mentioned that in 1933 in Magenta.

831
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,000
He did?

832
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:38,440
Richard Bissell mentioned the 1933 Magenta crash.

833
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,120
That's amazing.

834
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:47,000
That is such corroboration because that is a highly conflicted account.

835
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,720
1933 was the first recovery in Europe, in Magenta, Italy.

836
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:56,680
I fully trust David Grush, but that's amazing that there's some corroboration from back then.

837
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:57,720
He mentioned it.

838
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:58,220
Wow.

839
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:03,400
Italian government moved it to a secure air base in Italy

840
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,640
for the rest of kind of the fascist regime until 1944, 1945,

841
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:10,440
and you know the Pope Pius XII backchanneled that.

842
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:11,880
So the Vatican was involved.

843
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,800
Yeah, and told the Americans what the Italians had, and we ended up scooping it.

844
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:24,280
So he said this, yeah, he said this did not begin, and you need to know the background.

845
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:32,760
How did it end up that Truman transferred that object from Italy?

846
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:40,120
The steps getting there was arranged by Alan Dulles,

847
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,640
but that went back to what Pippa mentioned.

848
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:49,800
And he said the steps that Alan Dulles helped with the crash retrieval.

849
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:55,480
And remember, Alan Dulles and so John Foster Dulles and Alan Dulles are twins,

850
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:05,720
and John Foster Dulles is running the OSS, the precursor to U.S. intelligence, out of Switzerland.

851
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:11,240
And then I asked, I said, Dad, why was he running it out of Switzerland?

852
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,080
How does that happen?

853
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:18,760
And he said, well, everybody knew that he did it deliberately

854
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,240
so that he would be beyond the reach of U.S. law.

855
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:23,080
Let me explain.

856
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:30,200
After all of this, all these events a few years back, when I was still an official

857
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:39,320
in the office of the trade representative, well, I was the principal.

858
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:47,080
I was invited by, you know, Switzerland doesn't have a president,

859
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:51,320
the leader revolves around the canton leaders.

860
01:35:52,040 --> 01:36:01,800
But whoever was the leader that year, I visited the government about several matters,

861
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:07,400
and they served a life to see the office of Alan Dulles when he lived here.

862
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:13,800
So I said, oh, it would be fun to name a beautiful apartment overlooking the river.

863
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:21,880
And we got talking, I said, how do you explain why he chose to be here?

864
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:23,080
He said, oh, that's simple.

865
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:29,480
He told us when he got permission to maintain a very active office here

866
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:40,200
that as long as he was in Switzerland, no American law could reach him.

867
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:46,920
That's just something he did that was illegally moral or otherwise in the United States.

868
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:56,600
So he said he was here all the time, and it was to allow him a free hand to do the most

869
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:00,120
terrible things if needed.

870
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,520
Okay, that's understandable.

871
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:05,240
He was a creepy guy.

872
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:05,740
Right.

873
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:16,520
Now, going back to 1933, the relationship needs to be uncovered between

874
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:23,560
Angleton's father, Angleton, and the Knights of Malta.

875
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:25,020
Wow.

876
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:32,600
Because the Knights of Malta said there's long historical connection with the Vatican.

877
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:38,360
And indeed have this special diplomatic status.

878
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:45,000
You know, you can be, you can have an international passport for the Knight.

879
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,240
I forget how much it's a something.

880
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:51,000
It's a sovereign state for a handful of people.

881
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:51,500
Yes.

882
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:53,800
But it's all connected with the Vatican.

883
01:37:53,800 --> 01:38:05,480
According to multiple accounts, including UFO whistleblower David Grush, a disc-like object

884
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:11,080
measuring roughly 10 to 12 meters in diameter came down near Magenta in Lombardy, Italy,

885
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:12,680
in June of 1933.

886
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:15,240
1933 was the first recovery in Europe.

887
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:22,520
Under Benito Mussolini's fascist regime, a total media blackout was imposed throughout the

888
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,120
Stefani news agency.

889
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:29,400
Telegrams threatened severe penalties for any reporters who deviated from a government-ordered

890
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:32,360
cover story attributing the event to a meteor.

891
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:39,240
Despite the censorship, a special investigative body known as Gabinetto, or RS-33, formed to study

892
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:44,840
the craft, with high-level figures such as Mussolini, Air Marshal Italo Balbo, and Nobel

893
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:48,920
Laureate and radio pioneer Mark Coney believed to have been involved.

894
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:53,720
Testimonies suggest that the downed craft and possibly two recovered bodies were taken

895
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:58,520
to the SIAI Marchetti private aerospace hangars for intensive analysis.

896
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:04,680
This secret research group reportedly drew up a nine-step protocol to manage the Magenta crash

897
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,760
and any similar future incidents.

898
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:11,240
The instructions included immediate site containment, arrests of all witnesses,

899
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:14,840
and thorough disinformation campaigns to quell public attention.

900
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:18,360
Sounds very similar to what happened in the United States after Roswell.

901
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:23,560
Mark Coney, long fascinated by extraterrestrial possibilities, clashed with Mussolini's

902
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:27,160
insistence that the subject must be of terrestrial origin.

903
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:32,200
Some documents and later family confirmations indicate Mark Coney genuinely believed the craft

904
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,480
could be non-human.

905
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:39,640
In the late 1930s, Pope Pius XII became aware of the Magenta retrieval, reportedly fearing

906
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:45,080
that any recovered technology might fall into Nazi hands once Italy allied with Germany.

907
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:50,120
Through discreet channels, the pope quietly informed the allies about the craft's existence

908
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:51,560
and storage location.

909
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:56,120
This backchannel intelligence set the stage for the Office of Strategic Services,

910
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:01,720
America's premier wartime intelligence gathering program, and the predecessor to the CIA in World

911
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:06,120
War II, to intervene in northern Italy as the war approached its end.

912
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:12,520
Working under a secret project called McGregor, OSS operatives targeted advanced access technology,

913
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:15,160
including the rumored crashed UFO.

914
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:21,720
By 1945, the Americans had reportedly transferred the Italian UFO to Wright-Patterson Air Force

915
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:23,880
Base in Ohio for further study.

916
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:35,640
Many of the top Nazi scientists as a part of Operation Paperclip that the allies had

917
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:40,440
exfiltrated also made their way to Wright-Patterson to work on the Magenta craft.

918
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:46,040
Malta, as a sovereign territory with diplomatic immunity,

919
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:49,880
would be the perfect international guardians of UFO secrecy.

920
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:57,160
Initially, when Harold said the Knights of Malta were deeply embedded in the UFO story,

921
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:58,920
I had no idea what to think.

922
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:03,160
It sounded like a plot line from a Dan Brown or Umberto Eco novel.

923
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:08,840
Secret society associated with the Vatican and the sovereign state of Malta governs UFO secrecy.

924
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:09,480
Go figure.

925
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:15,320
But not only were Hugh Angleton and James Jesus Angleton Knights of Malta, and remember,

926
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:20,360
James Jesus Angleton seemed to be responsible for a lot of counterintelligence around UFOs

927
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:25,960
that came out from the 50s to the 80s, but the bizarre Knights of Malta-UFO connection runs even

928
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,880
deeper after further research.

929
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:32,760
Colonel Philip J. Corso, later famous for his claims regarding reverse engineering alien

930
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:38,280
materials at the Pentagon in his book The Day After Roswell, served as a high ranking intelligence

931
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:41,320
officer in Italy during the post-war period.

932
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:44,600
In fact, he was the personal liaison to the future pope.

933
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,680
He was also a Knight of Malta.

934
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:51,320
He was also a main figure in Operation Paperclip and helped create the quote-unquote

935
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:55,240
rat lines, exfiltrating Nazi scientists and technology.

936
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:59,320
In fact, many Nazi scientists specifically specializing in exotic

937
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:03,400
propulsion made their way to write Patterson Air Force Base after World War II.

938
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:07,240
Perhaps the most powerful general at the time, General Douglas MacArthur and his whole

939
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:09,800
intelligence staff, Knights of Malta.

940
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:14,600
Many of his staff displayed an unusual interest in the possibility of a quote-unquote

941
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:21,320
interplanetary war, and they framed alien-related eschatology in the exact same terms Corso did.

942
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:26,840
During a 1955 speech at West Point, General MacArthur told assembled cadets,

943
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:29,480
the next war will be an interplanetary war.

944
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:39,160
The nations of the earth must someday make a common front against attack by people from other planets.

945
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:44,600
Chief OSS member and another CIA founder, Wild Bill Donovan, who journalist Chris Sharpe notes

946
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:49,720
was likely not only involved in the Magenta crash retrieval, but in setting up original protocols

947
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:53,160
for UFO crash retrievals, was also a Knight of Malta.

948
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:58,520
Atomic energy director turned CIA director John McCone, later CIA director Bill Casey,

949
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:02,680
Knights of Malta. Remember that FDR was responsible for the communications with

950
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:05,640
the Vatican about the crashed Magenta craft.

951
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:11,000
Well, President Roosevelt's Vatican envoy, Myron Taylor, also a Knight of Malta.

952
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,240
Maybe religious studies professor Diana Walsh-Pasulka, who has visited the Vatican

953
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:20,280
archives and speaks with conviction that the Catholic Church knows more than meets the eye

954
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:24,840
about UFOs, isn't so crazy after all. Maybe she's spot on.

955
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:29,640
And look at the group that are supposedly engaging in UFO crash retrievals today,

956
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:34,520
JSOC or the Joint Special Operations Command. According to journalist Seymour Hersh,

957
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:38,520
one of the modern heads of JSOC, General Stanley McChrystal,

958
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:43,160
and many of the members of JSOC themselves are all Knights of Malta.

959
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,240
Does the DEWE currently work with JSOC?

960
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:50,680
We work with all of the security entities around the federal government.

961
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:52,440
Do you guys work with JSOC? Yes or no?

962
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:54,440
Yes, we do.

963
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:59,080
Okay. There are Templars at the Vatican.

964
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:08,440
It's the residue of the truth or the myth, whatever, of Knights of the Templars.

965
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:13,240
But there are rumors that the Knights of Malta have something to do with the UFO story as well.

966
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:18,760
Well, what I'm saying is, yeah, they did because Angleton was there.

967
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:23,880
So for context for the audience, James Jesus Angleton was sort of one of the

968
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:29,400
original founders of the CIA. Dulles was sort of a mentor to him. He was a skull and bones kid

969
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:36,120
and ends up in Italy. And he's kind of this eccentric, debonair, interesting guy

970
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:40,200
who was also really just good at conniving and lying.

971
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:45,640
And so Angleton's father, Hugh Angleton, was involved with the Knights of Malta?

972
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:48,280
He was a member.

973
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:56,280
He was a member. And then so he's involved in the Vatican, which makes it more likely

974
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:01,400
that James Jesus Angleton probably had something to do with the retrieval of that UFO,

975
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,640
the Magenta Crash, which was kept at the Vatican.

976
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:10,680
You're speculating, but there's so many connections. There's even a guy named John

977
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:17,080
Warner IV, who is the grandson of Paul Mellon and the son of Senator John Warner.

978
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:23,720
And he tells the story where he's three martinis into, you know, a dinner or whatever with Paul

979
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:27,080
Mellon. And Paul Mellon recalls the story. Paul Mellon is one of the founders of the CIA,

980
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:31,480
and he's with Alan Dulles doing tech retrieval. And specifically, he says,

981
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:37,080
I'm in Czechoslovakia and I'm standing on top of a saucer with Alan Dulles.

982
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:42,440
And my grandfather said, look, you know, we were in a facility, a hangar, and we saw, you know,

983
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:48,760
a German flying disc. And I said, you know, oh, is that the one that was cobbled together

984
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:54,280
with six BMW jet engines? And he laughed and he said, no.

985
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:59,080
Basically implying that it was like this anomalous object. And right there in Czechoslovakia and

986
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:04,840
modern day Poland is this thing called Komlerstab, where Hans Komler, the most ruthless Nazi who was

987
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:09,800
doing the most kind of black world technology projects, was rumored to be working on flying

988
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:14,280
saucers. And there's this rumor of this thing called Deglaca. And so you have the Hugh Angleton

989
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:21,640
connection, but you also have Dulles and Paul Mellon standing on top of this saucer. And when

990
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:29,240
the magenta object crashed, supposedly there was this partnership where Mussolini went to Hitler

991
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:33,160
and was like, I don't really know what to do with this. Is this yours? And then he said, no,

992
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:36,040
it's not ours, but we should work on it together. We should collaborate.

993
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:40,760
So there's, there is, there are actually a lot of data points around this. You start to build this,

994
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:45,800
this picture up. So Mussol said that too. That's amazing. And the Italians, even to this day,

995
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:51,960
are amongst the most innovative in defense technology in the world.

996
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:58,920
That's so interesting. So maybe that either some inherited technology or something. Let me tell

997
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:08,840
you one fact point that is not well known in America. When we look at the world, we say the

998
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:16,680
second most important military force is the UK and their, and especially the RAF, but they have

999
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:24,440
really dwindled in importance. And I didn't know this until recently, but I'm somewhat

1000
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:32,840
rather actively connected with the military world. I have a book coming up with essays on

1001
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:46,120
geosecurity of the last 25 years that's coming up soon. Laser. And anyway, no UAVs in it, but

1002
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:50,920
one of the people introducing the book was the

1003
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:59,560
chief of the Italian air force. And I said, that's a little bit odd. And the editor said, no,

1004
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:07,800
in Europe today, the most important air force besides the US is the Italian air force.

1005
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:14,280
I have no idea. Really? So maybe they might be more advanced than meets the eye.

1006
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:19,480
They were more advanced than the rest of them in Europe. Interesting. Yeah, this was news to me,

1007
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:26,440
but you know. I think of Italian, I guess the cars as being fast, but unreliable. And then,

1008
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:35,000
but wow, the air force. Well, northern Italy has world-class engineering, German level

1009
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:42,120
engineering, and they have it in many fields. And I always thought it was very interesting that

1010
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:49,000
after the second world war, the Germans were prohibited from going into aircraft because

1011
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:56,040
the Luftwaffe had been such a threat. And as a result, the Germans specialized in drones.

1012
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:04,040
And I got into drone technology about not quite 10 years ago, and the Germans are very strong in

1013
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:11,080
that. And I started to also realize how strong Italian engineering. But I think this episode in

1014
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:19,080
history is, it's not well, as well understood as it could be. And I just wonder, was this part

1015
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:27,080
of what drove the decision to create what we now call the Axis? That because the Italians assumed

1016
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:33,640
that this super high tech thing must be German. And that began their dialogue. And as they aligned,

1017
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:42,120
that became the Axis. Wow. And then again, back to George C. Marshall and the team

1018
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:49,160
that is basically cleaning up after the end of World War II and the recognition

1019
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:54,840
that many people have knowledge of very advanced technologies, they must be brought to the United

1020
01:49:54,840 --> 01:50:04,440
States. And that operation paperclip, period. And again, who's already there? It's all these

1021
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:10,440
cast of characters. And where have they been based? Italy. That's amazing. That's so fascinating.

1022
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:14,280
Again, there's no proof in that. But there's an interesting line of inquiry.

1023
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:19,080
But there's so much corroboration. Now we have Richard Bissell to add to the dullest Paul

1024
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:23,240
Mellon story, to add to David Grush's recent testimony. So we are building up this

1025
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:30,280
important corroborative narrative. I'm just mentioning in passing, you know,

1026
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:38,840
this washing stick I have, it's from an old shop. It's an old, it's an old car.

1027
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:45,560
But I was told it was Paul Mellon's washing stick. No way. That's so interesting. What do you,

1028
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:50,360
how did you end up with that? Well, they live in the same part of Virginia. Okay.

1029
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:58,520
I didn't know Paul Mellon, but I knew all the people around him, including his wife.

1030
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:10,360
How? Oh, and his personal, I recall, ran the fox hunt for him and took care of the horses.

1031
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:17,080
And, you know, he had race horses, everything. That guy became a close pal of mine. So I heard

1032
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:22,680
all these stories about Paul Mellon. So I didn't meet Paul Mellon, but I knew more about his life

1033
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:26,520
than you would imagine, including all his girlfriends. Oh gosh.

1034
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:35,800
But I have his washing stick. That's so interesting. That's wild. I kind of,

1035
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,800
I feel like we should put it in the shot or something. It was sent to me as part of my

1036
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:49,960
mission, but I still don't know my purpose. Thanks, Pippa. And so what, do you think the

1037
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:54,840
Knights of Malta play some sort of role in UFOs? And what do you think their role is?

1038
01:51:57,240 --> 01:52:05,480
Now you're getting to the heart of the residue of that organization that still exists.

1039
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:14,280
What form does it take? I have no idea, but they still have the sovereign state identity.

1040
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:18,840
Do you think it goes back to the original Templars? I don't know.

1041
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:25,480
Okay. But how did they get the sovereign state? The Vatican must have organized it.

1042
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:31,320
They seem to have kind of a lot of top level business leaders and politicians

1043
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:35,720
involved in the Knights of Malta. That's right. So something, yes,

1044
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:44,040
it's a secretive society. I mean, there are all these secret societies. So many things

1045
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:49,160
over the years have been attributed to the Council on Foreign Relations.

1046
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:59,320
Yes. I was a member of the Council for, I don't know, 50 years. I dropped out recently

1047
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:05,080
because they wanted me to keep sending them large amounts of money. I thought, yeah, you know,

1048
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:10,120
I've done my, I paid my dues. But when you get back for the Council on Foreign Relations,

1049
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:15,560
then you dig deeper. Well, wait a minute, it wasn't really them. It was some of them,

1050
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:26,040
select group through Brown Brothers Harriman that set up CIA. You know,

1051
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:34,840
they're different groups, did different things. And some of the great financial figures

1052
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:37,720
were involved with some, but not others.

1053
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:47,480
It's not very different from the WEF in Switzerland, a different group.

1054
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:51,560
But there's a Council on Foreign Relations Knights of Malta connection?

1055
01:53:54,360 --> 01:54:02,440
I would say there's some overlapping membership, but no connection. Anyway, the Council on Foreign

1056
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:10,680
Relations has been diluted and changed since the days of the Second World War and the Cold War.

1057
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:15,320
It's now much more diverse and much more

1058
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:22,920
defensive of who's ever in power in the White House. I don't know what they're going to do with

1059
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:33,800
Trump. But they have been, they've been swept along with progressive Democrats.

1060
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:40,440
Right. So this is, you just brought this in, this is Paul Mellon's walking stick that you ended up

1061
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:46,200
with. I can't verify it, but that's what I was told. These are the rumors. Does it represent

1062
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:50,440
anything? It looks very unique. Well, he had a lot of power.

1063
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:59,160
So that was bestowed upon you. What else, what else did Richard Bissell tell you?

1064
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:07,960
Well, I mean, I think I've explained that in essence, there are a multiplicity of powers

1065
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:12,200
in play at any moment. And around presidents,

1066
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:19,720
they have certain powers, but they are constrained by these other powers.

1067
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:28,280
And among them, the intelligence community is very powerful because it has found a way

1068
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:37,000
to fund itself and to multiply itself. So you can't look at the budget and say,

1069
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:44,280
that's what it is. It's, it operates businesses, legitimate and illegitimate.

1070
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:49,720
Right. So it's sort of this gangly octopus. It's impossible to really capture.

1071
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:58,760
And so the Russians do this too. And they even do it in overt ways. They did with the,

1072
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:04,600
this group that the leader was assassinated.

1073
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:07,640
Progosian.

1074
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:09,640
Oh, Wagner. Wagner.

1075
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:12,680
Oh, Wagner group. Yeah. Progosian. Yeah.

1076
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:19,800
I mean, they do, that's overt. They do it not overt. The Chinese are everywhere doing

1077
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:29,800
all kinds of stuff. Even in Manhattan. So when you weigh actions, you have to take into account

1078
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:36,200
what you see and what you don't see, the unseen enemies, the, I should have been aware of that

1079
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:45,320
when I blurted out some of these comments on UAPs and I stumbled into controversy. I had no

1080
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:50,600
intention of, have you gotten any backlash because you've been saying some remarkable

1081
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:56,200
things on Twitter or X rather. Yeah. I usually get it. So the dad dropped something on Twitter

1082
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:02,840
and suddenly my inbox is full, like full. What people say, you know, your dad is breaking the

1083
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:09,240
internet. But that seems positive. It's mostly positive. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She calls

1084
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:16,200
me from some far away place, rakes me up in a room, you know, you see different hours and

1085
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:23,640
dang, you just blew up the internet. I actually, I called up, I said, I leave you alone for five

1086
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:31,400
minutes. Breaking the internet. I love it. I carefully crafted some backing up language

1087
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:34,520
that I was not directly

1088
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:45,000
involved with UAP research. You said read my words carefully. Right. Now if you read them carefully,

1089
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:51,640
I was not, I'm saying it, I was not directed to look at that. It was,

1090
01:57:54,120 --> 01:58:00,760
but I didn't say that I wasn't aware of it. Yeah. And I knew that eventually this stuff

1091
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:07,800
would come out and say, yeah, I knew about that. But I used the words to make it look like I was

1092
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:13,880
backing away speculation, but I didn't do that. The words didn't suggest I was speculating.

1093
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:21,320
I think this is an issue sometimes with people who are high up in government who want to disclose

1094
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:26,600
certain things, but don't want to break any sort of relationships they have or oaths they've sworn

1095
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:32,200
or clearances they have where you'll hear David Grush or something spec, he'll say,

1096
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:36,360
this is open source. This is a personal story and he'll have to caveat constantly with that.

1097
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:40,600
And so if you're an average person, you just immediately, your skeptical trigger goes off.

1098
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:45,560
But in fact, he's trying to do you a service and saying, look at this, this is open source.

1099
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:50,840
I just don't want to end up, you know, under the gun here because I don't want to, I don't want to,

1100
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:55,480
you know, end up in jail. You're giving your enemies fodder. The thing to keep in mind,

1101
01:58:55,480 --> 01:59:00,760
as in the research I've done too, is what you find is a lot of this cast of characters,

1102
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:07,720
including James Jesus Angleton, who went on to become the key person at the CIA.

1103
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:15,160
They all seem to have been part of General George C. Marshall's team at the end of the

1104
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:21,400
second world war. They're all involved with the Marshall plan somehow or another, including

1105
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:32,520
Kennedy and Forrestal for a period are part of that. And so difficult to prove, but strange that

1106
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:39,640
they all seem to be connected to this subject. Well, Forrestal was supposedly on this majestic

1107
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:45,400
12. Who knows how much of the majestic 12 is true, but this sort of, you know, elite military and

1108
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:51,560
intelligence advisory board for Truman and Eisenhower. And then George Marshall also,

1109
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:56,840
there's this thing called the battle of Los Angeles in 1942, where UFO shows up and like

1110
01:59:56,840 --> 02:00:02,600
flies down the coast. And George Marshall was briefed to that. And so they're very interesting.

1111
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:07,080
Okay. So you have, and then the other connections I think that are important to make with the

1112
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:14,760
Marshall plan is that was kind of immediately after these tech retrieval programs in Europe.

1113
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:22,120
So the Nazis had all this advanced technology and you had TICOM and ASOS. One was, you know,

1114
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:26,040
signals intelligence. The other was, you know, atomic intelligence. And it was trying to retrieve

1115
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:31,320
their most exotic technology. And if there was anything, you know, involving UFOs there,

1116
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:37,720
that would sort of be bound up in it. One of my closest friends when I came to Washington

1117
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:46,360
was an attorney named Tom Farmer. And Tom and I played tennis together, you know,

1118
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:51,880
but turned out Tom had been general counsel of CIA.

1119
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:58,840
And he'd been at, again, with the guys during the Marshall plan.

1120
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:06,200
Well, I was going to say, it turned out he was involved in the project called Paperslip,

1121
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:13,000
of picking Germans. And the reason why was he was born in Berlin

1122
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:21,240
of a father who was a U.S. diplomat, but he spoke German fluently. So,

1123
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:28,280
now, it never dawned on me when I thought maybe it was my friend that started asking

1124
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:35,000
you about Paperslip, but I learned later he knew everything. He was one of the people saying yes

1125
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:47,240
for him, no for him, you know. Do you believe that advanced technology has benefited from

1126
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:52,200
retrieved unidentified aerial objects? So, this would be like the Philip Corso,

1127
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:58,200
day after Roswell narrative. The answer I would have to give is yes in two ways.

1128
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:08,760
In one way, we have learned that some types of propulsion, for example,

1129
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:19,960
exists that we never envisage, never conceived. The second way

1130
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:32,440
is that they have revealed a higher level of knowledge than anything we have on Earth,

1131
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:41,400
and we don't control it. Now, we only recently even

1132
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:49,240
confirmed where is it coming from? I mean, you know, we have this new telescope looking up,

1133
02:02:49,240 --> 02:03:00,760
where are they? But then we have one revelation by the oceanographer in the last few days who says

1134
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:10,360
they are not China, they are not U.S., they are not extraterrestrial, meaning they're either here

1135
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:20,360
already under the water or subterranean, that's where they are. And then David Grashe talks about

1136
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:29,400
is it interdimensional? And one sort of wonders, is this semantics? If you ask officially,

1137
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:35,880
are there extraterrestrials? The answer is no, because extraterrestrial means off planet,

1138
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:44,920
but it doesn't include if it's interdimensional, if it's ocean-based. Are we actually all talking

1139
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:51,720
across purposes? Well, it's the reason the All Domain Anomalous Research Office, which is headed

1140
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:56,680
up by Kirk Patrick, who has all these sort of, you know, and we should get into the atomic ties

1141
02:03:56,680 --> 02:04:03,480
to the UFO question, he has all this whole history in atomic research, he was at Oak Ridge, and he

1142
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:09,480
always rests on we have no hard evidence of extraterrestrial life. But of course, you know,

1143
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:13,400
you have these anomalous things, you haven't done a proper analysis on them, you don't know what they

1144
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:18,440
are, you haven't classified them, and so you just, you use, that's like this straw manning way of,

1145
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:21,720
you know, explaining the thing away, and for an average person who's not really into the topic,

1146
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:26,040
you go, oh, this official is saying that there's no extraterrestrials. Yeah, but it's always

1147
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:32,520
extraterrestrial. So is there anything else that Richard Bissell told you? I hate to, you know,

1148
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:37,480
harp on that one interaction, but it just, it's so fascinating, you have this guy who's number two

1149
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:43,560
at the CIA, he set up Area 51, and he's briefing you on other world technologies. Does he say

1150
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:55,160
anything else? Well, he didn't admit to or talk about bad things that had happened. He didn't

1151
02:04:55,160 --> 02:05:05,800
want to get into a discussion about the Bay of Pigs. He didn't raise incidents where we have

1152
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:15,400
overturned governments. Somehow he avoided that stuff. But I think most of it was about if you

1153
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:24,360
work at the leadership level, whether you are a leader or a guide to a leader, you've got to

1154
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:35,720
keep it in play in their minds for conflicting forces, and a lot of these forces are not on any

1155
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:48,600
legal boxes of who has authority over what. You can't do a diagram that is meaningful for the

1156
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:55,800
entire U.S. government because a lot of it is other power networks. Well, there's Michael Turner,

1157
02:05:55,880 --> 02:06:05,400
who's been, I mean, he was a linchpin for three companies at least, and, you know, he blocked

1158
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:11,480
everything. Suddenly he's, that's very unusual. Someone with that much power, usually you have to

1159
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:21,640
buy them off. You give them something else more important. You promote them. Yeah, someone asked

1160
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:28,120
me once, what's the most effective way to get rid of a major enemy? I said, you promote them.

1161
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:37,320
Give them something more visible where their ego can be pacified. I did it more than once.

1162
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:45,080
You don't want them licking their wounds. You'd rather have them happy and

1163
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:51,240
not focused on whatever they were focused on. I've never been publicly cognizant,

1164
02:06:52,680 --> 02:07:01,480
but there were times, well, I think Pippa had breakfast with one member of the Congress at one

1165
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:09,400
time. She told me, Dad, I had breakfast with him, and I asked him, how is it that Dad has so much

1166
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:17,480
power, but he has no enemies? So many enemies. He said the only thing he would say is,

1167
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:26,840
the rumor is none survived. So whether that's true or not, I cultivated that rumor. I told everybody

1168
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:39,320
that's the rumor. Don't ask me. I think the key here is, it's not so much what Richard Bissell

1169
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:45,880
say directly to Dad, although that has immense value. It's important to capture this for posterity,

1170
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:54,440
but it's also an invitation. You are now part of a network of people. It will be known that you've

1171
02:07:54,440 --> 02:08:01,000
been blessed. It will be known not just in our government. It will be known in other governments.

1172
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:07,000
It will be known by the Russians, and that network operates for the whole of your life.

1173
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:21,240
There are different sources of information about how communication between JFK and

1174
02:08:21,320 --> 02:08:29,240
First Drops was established. Now, for the average human in the world in which we live, they pick up

1175
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:39,000
the phone. But number one, First Drops represented the Central Committee. If you were really going

1176
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:47,480
to communicate with the Central Committee, you would use Dobrynin, the ambassador who had a

1177
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:57,880
direct line, so he would know. So if he didn't serve, I think he may have served us, but we

1178
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:04,920
don't know. He didn't disclose. But I know Dobrynin. I can tell you about that later. But

1179
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:08,440
I mean, he came to know me. That's how short that was.

1180
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:15,560
But, um, but- And the American ambassador, was that Walter Stossel or who?

1181
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:21,560
I don't know. It didn't matter. The only thing that mattered was Dobrynin was number one

1182
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:30,680
power in communication with Moscow. But that was the official channels.

1183
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:36,760
But there seems that there were also unofficial channels. Well, there had to be. And one of them

1184
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:47,480
was, it seems, Norman Cousins, who was against nuclear weapons and somehow was able to pass

1185
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:55,240
letters back and forth that reached Khrushchev. I'm trying to think back. I haven't talked about

1186
02:09:55,240 --> 02:10:07,480
this before. My first encounter with Dobrynin, as I said, he arrived in 62, a phenomenon unusual,

1187
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:20,440
the member of the Central Committee. And I was attending some months after this in 63.

1188
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:27,560
And I went to one of these Washington galas, you know, the White House press corps,

1189
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:36,520
roast of the president, or one of those. We have those events. And when you're invited,

1190
02:10:37,640 --> 02:10:45,320
you get a seat with a name card. You don't sit where you want. You sit where your name card is.

1191
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:55,160
So I sat down, this distinguished looking gentleman sat next to me

1192
02:10:57,320 --> 02:11:06,200
and said, Hi, I'm Hal Momkin. He said, Yes, I know you. I am Ambassador Dobrynin.

1193
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:23,400
So all my alarms went off. That's not accidental. He chose to sit there, I'm sure. So I'll have to be careful.

1194
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:38,280
And he just chatted in a friendly way. Your name is well known in Russia. Long before you're at these

1195
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:47,000
heavy levels of decision making, I said, Why is that? He said, You're named after your uncle,

1196
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:54,680
whose name is identical to mine. He said he was really famous as a chess player,

1197
02:11:54,680 --> 02:12:01,080
especially among all the security people who are nuts about in KGB and others about chess,

1198
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:12,760
who was the chess champion. And he played many Russians. So he said, You were identified

1199
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:24,040
as the progeny of that Harold Momkin, which in our way of thinking is good bloodlines.

1200
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:34,840
And so we chatted about that and how coming to Washington was a surprise for me. He said,

1201
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:40,440
Well, you've landed at the center of everything. I said, Yeah, I'm surprised. He said, Yeah,

1202
02:12:40,840 --> 02:12:47,240
I gather you were in there with the generals. I said, How would you know that? He said,

1203
02:12:50,280 --> 02:12:57,160
Our system is far more thorough. You should be aware of that than you might imagine.

1204
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:06,120
I said, Yeah, you didn't ask me about what took place except to say you emerged as someone

1205
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:14,520
who was able to talk down the most belligerent

1206
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:26,360
American military official of all time, or about time anyway. And so he said,

1207
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:30,360
made you of interest. How did you do that?

1208
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:46,680
Well, like a chess player, how did you win? And so later, we had these encounters, I don't know,

1209
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:55,400
once a year or something. Unplanned viewers found me. Let's have a chat. And

1210
02:13:57,880 --> 02:14:02,440
he did ask, I have never talked about this. He did ask at one time,

1211
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:12,200
Why is everyone so excited about these unidentified flying objects?

1212
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:21,560
Really? He just, innocently, he wasn't quite a pumps intelligence out of me about anything

1213
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:30,200
specific. He was very careful. I said, because it's something we don't control. It's very simple.

1214
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:38,600
Whatever it is, we feel threatened because we only feel safe when we are in total control.

1215
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:50,760
Nations are never in total control. There are always unexpected challenges. I said,

1216
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:56,120
Yeah, but tell that to somebody in Washington. I mean, they are not students of history in

1217
02:14:56,120 --> 02:15:10,600
Washington. The emergence of new threats. It's not something we easily absorb. It's not our culture.

1218
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:18,760
We're either triumphant or not. Winning the second world war made us feel really superior.

1219
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:31,640
So he said, there's something there, I remember he said, that is dividing your country,

1220
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:39,160
but maybe could unify our two countries. That's the way he said it.

1221
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:42,360
And this is about the UFO subject.

1222
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:43,720
So extraordinary.

1223
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:44,220
Wow.

1224
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:54,280
I think he was looking for me to say something, but I was not privy to those

1225
02:15:56,600 --> 02:16:01,320
letters between JFK and Khrushchev.

1226
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:07,080
And there are rumors that JFK wanted to do a joint space program with the Soviets

1227
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:12,840
around this and use the UFO thing as kind of a unifying rallying cry or something.

1228
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:27,640
Number one reason, that's not being misguided by these events to think it might be us versus them,

1229
02:16:28,280 --> 02:16:34,280
that this is not Russia or the US. So we need an early warning system.

1230
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:38,360
Those things that you see are not ours.

1231
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:45,560
That makes sense. How it extended beyond that to the other idea.

1232
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:54,040
Maybe we should work together. Put the swords down and let's come up with a way

1233
02:16:55,960 --> 02:17:01,720
to develop our futures without being mortal enemies.

1234
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:09,720
Now, that switch, my understanding was definitely in Kennedy's mind.

1235
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:18,520
And so, did I see any note? No, I didn't. But some people did.

1236
02:17:19,480 --> 02:17:28,680
The fact that he expressed verbally to a number of the senior people his desire to share our

1237
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:43,160
knowledge of UFOs with Russia caused alarm among some officials in Washington. Now,

1238
02:17:44,840 --> 02:17:52,760
Khrushchev may definitely, but that was one of many things that JFK and he were fighting about.

1239
02:17:53,400 --> 02:18:02,680
So, but it seemed to alarm people at CIA, some people, CIA is a big organization.

1240
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:09,240
There is this letter that was foiled, used the Freedom of Information Act to get out of the

1241
02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:15,160
government in 2005. And it's of controversial provenance. So we should caveat that to the

1242
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:22,120
audience. But it's a letter from JFK to acting CIA director John McCone after he had fired Dulles.

1243
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:26,680
And he's basically saying, we need to coordinate. I need all of the data on, quote, unquote,

1244
02:18:26,680 --> 02:18:34,200
unknowns in sensitive airspace from NASA, because we need to coordinate better with the Russians.

1245
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:38,840
So they don't mistake these unknowns as acts of American aggression. And that he's basically

1246
02:18:38,840 --> 02:18:42,520
saying, I need all the UFO data so I can better coordinate with the Russians and we don't end up

1247
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:51,720
in some horrible bomb out scenario due to the UFOs. How do we deconflict? How do we create

1248
02:18:51,720 --> 02:18:56,920
a regime for deconfliction so that we don't inadvertently fire and it's not the Russians,

1249
02:18:56,920 --> 02:19:03,960
or vice versa? And in the 1971 SALT treaty, it's written into it. It's that sort of same

1250
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:09,320
language is written in there. And so do we think that this letter might be real,

1251
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:20,920
this 2005 FOIA letter? That's amazing. Do you think that UFOs played any sort of part in JFK's death?

1252
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:32,680
This is pure speculation until we see. But do I think so? Yes. I think it was probably

1253
02:19:33,480 --> 02:19:36,200
the number one issue. Why do you think that?

1254
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:47,000
Because from what I have read, not what I know, because I don't know anything about the actual

1255
02:19:47,000 --> 02:20:01,000
documents sent by JFK to Russia, but what I've read is that he wanted to talk openly about

1256
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:10,520
the UAP phenomenon and the basis for why don't we stop fighting with each other

1257
02:20:11,160 --> 02:20:20,920
and join forces with and make peace. And he also wanted to reduce the nuclear arsenal on both sides.

1258
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:27,080
Yes. And that was also a threat and challenge to certain part of the community. And Dulles

1259
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:31,560
specifically hated that vis-a-vis China because it was like if we didn't have nukes, they would

1260
02:20:31,560 --> 02:20:39,320
outman us. Yeah, it was really by numbers. So you think maybe in some of that correspondence,

1261
02:20:39,320 --> 02:20:46,040
it was, let's work together on the non-human intelligence or alien issue. It's funny. Douglas

1262
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:52,920
Caddy, who is the lawyer of Howard Hunt, Howard Hunt's this known CIA, longtime spook who shows

1263
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:57,160
up in all sorts of, he's like the janitor in Watergate or whatever. It's incredible.

1264
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:05,160
Douglas Caddy says, I kept asking Howard Hunt, what was the JFK murder actually about?

1265
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:09,000
And he kept giving these kind of deflection answers. And then finally he says,

1266
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:18,280
it was about the alien presence. I think it was. That's fascinating. I think JFK fully knew all

1267
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:24,040
about UFOs long before he became president. What gives you conviction in that? Because

1268
02:21:25,480 --> 02:21:32,360
he was in naval intelligence for a while. He learned most of it from Forrestal.

1269
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:39,240
He was in intelligence. Forrestal was secretary of the Navy before becoming secretary of defense.

1270
02:21:39,240 --> 02:21:46,040
Yeah. And Forrestal fully briefed him and talked about it. And he talked about it. You'll have to

1271
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:52,680
do the history, but he was fully briefed by Forrestal. How do we know Forrestal knew about

1272
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:59,880
UFOs? Because there are tons of rumors. He managed Admiral Byrd, who engaged in Operation High Jump,

1273
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:08,760
bringing probably like 70 or so ships and 33, I think, airplanes and almost 5,000 men down the

1274
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:14,600
coast of Argentina and towards Antarctica. And they reportedly encounter all these flying saucers

1275
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:21,400
that are shooting at them with lasers. But other than that, do we have any real evidence that

1276
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:29,400
Forrestal knew about UFOs? You have to do more research. My research, which tends to be scattered

1277
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:39,240
until recently, I haven't tried to organize it. But I found several references to Forrestal,

1278
02:22:40,600 --> 02:22:46,040
for him going to Forrestal with questions and getting answers. Interesting. Well, you know,

1279
02:22:46,040 --> 02:22:52,200
JFK was also extremely interested in astrophysics at Harvard and was close with Don Menzel, who was

1280
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:57,240
this famous UFO debunker, but who admitted to JFK that he held some of the deepest, you know,

1281
02:22:57,960 --> 02:23:04,040
clearances across the board, CIA, NSA and Navy. And so maybe there's some sort of connection there.

1282
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:14,440
But did you ever speak to JFK about UFOs directly? No, no. My interaction with JFK

1283
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:24,760
and Bobby was very limited. But I was somehow part of the plan because Sarge Schreiber, the

1284
02:23:24,760 --> 02:23:35,640
brethren though, was the go-between. He talked to me all the time. Sarge Schreiber proposed me

1285
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:40,680
several different jobs, and I defined each one.

1286
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:50,120
But I was an accepted inner circle person. But Bobby and Teddy, they were consumed

1287
02:23:50,760 --> 02:24:00,280
with events that seemed to be coming at them faster and faster. If I look back at top management,

1288
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:07,080
I would have to say they were operating without an adequate buffer system.

1289
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:15,640
So my guess is they were overloaded with stuff and didn't have a way. Neither one of them.

1290
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:21,320
When you're a senator, you have a small staff, but you know, you're operating on your own.

1291
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:28,520
You don't know how to run an apparatus. Someone like LBJ came in. He ran the whole damn Senate.

1292
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:41,880
Some multitude of people at lower levels. But JFK came in with a small limited naval experience,

1293
02:24:41,880 --> 02:24:52,520
but seemed to be busy with Forrestal. Do you think Forrestal's death had anything to do with

1294
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:59,400
UFOs? So Forrestal was sort of pushed out of his position as Secretary of Defense,

1295
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:06,280
and he was sort of betting on George Dewey against Truman. And then he ends up in this Navy hospital

1296
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:11,160
in Bethesda, Maryland, and he sort of, you know, gets killed by gravity, quote unquote. So he's

1297
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:17,080
like mid-writing some Sophocles poem. I think his brother, Harry Forrestal, had met with him the

1298
02:25:17,080 --> 02:25:22,920
day before, said he was totally of sound mind. Through a window didn't seem to be openable.

1299
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:28,200
That's right. That was the other thing. Yeah, and it was like his bathrobe was like tied to the,

1300
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:32,920
the whole thing made no sense. So do you think that had anything to do with an interest in

1301
02:25:33,480 --> 02:25:44,840
UFO subject? Probably. Wow. But I'm not going to speculate. Yeah. And so after JFK and all these

1302
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:50,040
guys, George McBundy, all of his top aides, they go to Los Alamos. They're presumably given the

1303
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:57,320
same sort of briefing that you got. Do you think he then takes an increased interest in UFOs

1304
02:25:57,960 --> 02:26:09,880
at all? Yes. And what makes you think that? I think JFK somehow saw this moment to make world

1305
02:26:09,880 --> 02:26:18,120
peace. We weren't worried about China at that moment. But why don't we and the Soviets just

1306
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:26,600
stop fighting, join forces, explain what we know together, and deal with this

1307
02:26:28,120 --> 02:26:36,120
force that we don't understand. And somehow in that exchange during the crisis itself,

1308
02:26:37,160 --> 02:26:45,400
there were communications with Russia. We don't know every word. Maybe some of it is recorded.

1309
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:54,520
And some of it may have been through Dobrin, who may have used his lines.

1310
02:26:56,520 --> 02:27:03,960
He had his method of communication that was theoretically, it couldn't impregnate probably.

1311
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:14,040
I've seen him establish a working discussion between two guys. And that's a thread that

1312
02:27:14,040 --> 02:27:20,440
recurs occasionally. Actually, Gorbachev was being interviewed by Charlie Rose.

1313
02:27:21,240 --> 02:27:28,600
And Charlie is saying, you know, talk to me about your correspondence with Reagan.

1314
02:27:28,600 --> 02:27:34,520
And Gorbachev goes in a really weird direction that nobody expects. And he says, well, one time

1315
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:39,400
we're sitting there, you know, Reagan turns to him and he whispers, he says,

1316
02:27:39,480 --> 02:27:47,320
if the United States were attacked by someone from outer space,

1317
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:59,560
would you help us? I said, no doubt about it. He said, we do. So that's interesting.

1318
02:28:00,360 --> 02:28:05,880
Right now in modern times, we are clearly shooting at these things.

1319
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:14,040
In the week of the Chinese balloon, there were three other unidentified objects that the military

1320
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:22,040
said they shot down. And so here's just a very profound question. If this represents higher

1321
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:29,560
intelligence or even just intelligence, let alone higher intelligence, is shooting at it the right

1322
02:28:30,040 --> 02:28:36,840
way to open the conversation? Number one. Number two, generally speaking, you're not supposed to

1323
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:46,280
shoot at stuff if you don't know what it is. And so are we locked into a kind of 1950s

1324
02:28:47,560 --> 02:28:54,280
thinking about this thing? Because it's so secret. It's so compartmentalized. It's so dangerous to

1325
02:28:54,360 --> 02:29:00,600
national security that no one can even really discuss this. And are we missing

1326
02:29:02,520 --> 02:29:09,560
something quite profound because we won't even ask the question, why are we shooting at something

1327
02:29:10,120 --> 02:29:14,600
that we don't understand and might represent intelligence of some kind?

1328
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:18,920
Maybe they're sort of waiting. You know, there's one of my favorite quotes, Eden Philpott. It's

1329
02:29:18,920 --> 02:29:23,560
like, the world is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to get sharper.

1330
02:29:23,960 --> 02:29:28,360
And there's something about this bi-directional, you know, if we ascend to a certain level,

1331
02:29:28,360 --> 02:29:33,160
maybe we can have communion with these things, but it doesn't really make sense for them to

1332
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:41,560
show themselves to us until then. Again, regardless of whether it is real, since we can't identify it,

1333
02:29:41,560 --> 02:29:48,040
what I find, again, interesting to observe is the level of fear that exists. And particularly in that

1334
02:29:48,040 --> 02:29:55,560
official circles and amongst the militaries, because of the lack of control, that it must be

1335
02:29:56,360 --> 02:30:03,080
dangerous. It must be a threat. And you will often hear the discussion of there's this thing

1336
02:30:03,080 --> 02:30:10,280
in our airspace. I'm like, what if we're in its airspace? Yeah, right, right. Just a creative

1337
02:30:10,280 --> 02:30:17,640
way of thinking. What's the definition of airspace in a world where we have a James Webb

1338
02:30:17,640 --> 02:30:24,920
telescope that is literally millions of miles away? We're probably in a lot of other airspaces

1339
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:31,640
that we can't even identify. So it's just, again, given the level of scientific and technological

1340
02:30:31,640 --> 02:30:38,760
advancement that we humanity are capable of, we are sending drones millions of miles away.

1341
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:47,160
Why are we surprised if we have something here as well? And so it's the way you begin the thought

1342
02:30:47,160 --> 02:30:55,560
process on this. I fear we're stuck in this mental lockdown that made sense in 1950,

1343
02:30:56,120 --> 02:31:01,800
but it doesn't make sense in 2025. It really doesn't. It doesn't even make sense from a

1344
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:06,840
national security standpoint, which shouldn't be the primary lens through which we see this,

1345
02:31:06,840 --> 02:31:12,280
but it is an important lens. And it doesn't make sense. Yeah, exactly. If you have this

1346
02:31:12,280 --> 02:31:18,600
over-compartmentalization and Cold War secrecy where you have these aerospace prime contractors

1347
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:23,400
that were sent to do this so you couldn't use the Freedom of Information Act or you wouldn't have

1348
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:27,880
civilian oversight or whatever. Plausible deniability. Plausible deniability. And then

1349
02:31:27,880 --> 02:31:31,160
you have constant compartmentalization. So the left-hand side talking to the right,

1350
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:36,600
you're not getting the proper coordination on the most advanced and exciting and interesting R&D.

1351
02:31:37,560 --> 02:31:41,480
I would go a bit further. And again, Dad and I have talked a lot about this.

1352
02:31:42,520 --> 02:31:53,400
There's another layer of this problem, and that is China, Russia, India, they never had what we

1353
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:58,520
would call a Cartesian Revolution. Meaning in the West, the United States and Europe,

1354
02:31:59,480 --> 02:32:07,960
after Rene Descartes, the philosopher, basically split apart the scientific from the mystical,

1355
02:32:07,960 --> 02:32:15,960
the mysterious, the religious, the belief systems. And we continue to this day to have this split.

1356
02:32:17,160 --> 02:32:22,760
And so therefore, you can't study this stuff because if it's not repeatable, it's not subject

1357
02:32:22,760 --> 02:32:30,360
to scientific analyses because that's all about repeatability. But the rest of the world didn't

1358
02:32:30,360 --> 02:32:36,920
have this split and they still think holistically. And you can have mystical happenings with

1359
02:32:36,920 --> 02:32:44,200
scientific findings, and that is not contradictory in China, in Russia, in India, and across Africa.

1360
02:32:44,840 --> 02:32:52,280
So the question today is, is China, maybe in collaboration with Russia, making more progress

1361
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:57,640
because they don't have this mental hang-up? If you wanted to study certain kinds of things

1362
02:32:57,640 --> 02:33:02,680
related to what's called ESP in the United States, you had to hide it very carefully

1363
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:06,680
because you were crazy and the government didn't want you people to think they're supporting crazy

1364
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:13,000
stuff. But if you wanted to do the work in Russia, go right ahead. Fine, here's your money. Because

1365
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:18,280
they're not caught in the religion that says it's not possible. That's an interesting question.

1366
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:25,880
We can't bring our science to it because we have an inhibition. And if China can,

1367
02:33:27,320 --> 02:33:33,240
is it possible that they will announce this first? And that's part of why I think a lot of this

1368
02:33:33,800 --> 02:33:37,640
is progressing. There's a fear of what is called catastrophic disclosure.

1369
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:44,760
And then China says, we have the fastest supercomputers and quantum computers. We have

1370
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:50,840
the best artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence. We got to the moon before

1371
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:58,200
you guys in this round, which looks like it's a real possibility. And we have found something.

1372
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:06,840
And if that is announced, we in the West will go, well, prove it. But the whole rest of the world

1373
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:17,080
in that moment, the danger is all the adulation, admiration of Los Alamos, of NASA, all eyes turn

1374
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:22,280
to Beijing. And then we can say, oh, well, but this is not scientific and you can't prove it.

1375
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:28,840
But the whole rest of the world is still in awe and wonder. And that is another reason why

1376
02:34:29,480 --> 02:34:36,200
is not in our control here in the United States. There's a real possibility that our competitors

1377
02:34:36,200 --> 02:34:40,280
are racing ahead because they haven't got these mental constraints.

1378
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:51,000
I think that's very well said. Yeah. And I hope policy makers and whoever's listening to this

1379
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,960
listens to that and we make real changes accordingly.

1380
02:35:00,280 --> 02:35:03,880
We're going to do an Explain That Tweet series with you.

1381
02:35:03,880 --> 02:35:09,080
Oh, God. The ones that had me going, Dad, what the heck?

1382
02:35:09,080 --> 02:35:16,760
I call Curtis LeMay and I said, General, I know we have a room at Wright-Patterson

1383
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:25,720
where you put all his secret stuff. Can I go in there? I've never heard him get mad,

1384
02:35:26,760 --> 02:35:32,680
but he got madder than hell at me, cussed me out, said, don't ever ask me that question.

1385
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:40,200
You said on X that you thought Curtis LeMay had some knowledge of the UAP topic.

1386
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:42,200
Yeah. Why do you think that?

1387
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:50,440
I never heard him say something about that, but the research that he was into included the

1388
02:35:51,960 --> 02:35:57,320
nuclear-powered airplane for the better bombers. Project Orion.

1389
02:35:57,320 --> 02:36:06,120
The better bombers. I have to think about it. I have a reason somewhere in the back of my head.

1390
02:36:06,120 --> 02:36:08,840
Maybe we're going to have a break soon. I'll have to think.

1391
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:13,720
Yeah. He started the RAND Corporation and was interested in Townsend Brown's work as well.

1392
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,800
And RAND did right on the subject at the beginning.

1393
02:36:18,680 --> 02:36:23,400
They did. And you know who ended up running RAND, was the president of RAND for

1394
02:36:24,360 --> 02:36:30,040
over two or three decades. It was Michael Rich, who's Ben Rich's son. Ben Rich is obviously

1395
02:36:31,080 --> 02:36:36,280
the successor to Kelly Johnson at Skunk Works, who's responsible for the stealth revolution.

1396
02:36:37,160 --> 02:36:40,600
Small group of people that are all interconnected.

1397
02:36:40,600 --> 02:36:49,240
Yes, absolutely. You also said on X that you have uncovered collaboration between

1398
02:36:49,240 --> 02:36:52,120
Nikola Tesla and Thomas Townsend Brown.

1399
02:36:52,120 --> 02:37:00,120
Yeah, but I said to you informally, I did not get that from any U.S. source.

1400
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:02,440
What source did you get it from?

1401
02:37:04,840 --> 02:37:06,440
Foreign intelligence.

1402
02:37:06,440 --> 02:37:09,720
Do you think it is a good source? Do you think it's real?

1403
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:12,440
No reason. Why would somebody tell me that?

1404
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,400
Do you know the nature of that collaboration?

1405
02:37:15,400 --> 02:37:25,320
Yeah, because nobody had associated them. Now, as I say, I have a network worldwide.

1406
02:37:27,160 --> 02:37:34,120
It's not a network of secrets. It's a network of trusted people. I mean, during a lot of these

1407
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:45,240
recent years, I had friends, the national security chief for the Japanese prime minister, my buddy,

1408
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:47,000
from Europe.

1409
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:51,720
Actually, Dad, we should say that after you served Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford,

1410
02:37:51,720 --> 02:37:57,880
you were also an advisor to many heads of government for many European countries.

1411
02:37:57,880 --> 02:38:03,640
You advised every single Japanese prime minister since Takenaka in 1971.

1412
02:38:03,640 --> 02:38:10,840
So, I mean, the breadth of the network that he has is exceptional. I've never seen anything like it.

1413
02:38:11,720 --> 02:38:16,840
Well, when Nixon went down, Jerry Ford entered the White House.

1414
02:38:19,160 --> 02:38:27,720
The first full day, I got summoned. He was there with Bill Seidman. Bill Seidman was,

1415
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:35,880
later years, the head of resolution trust and the FDIC and all that. Bill Seidman was brilliant.

1416
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:44,040
Anyway, he said, Hal, we've got something you want to do. I said, you know, I'm probably going to

1417
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:49,320
leave the government soon. Well, don't hurry. We have a lot of things we want you to do.

1418
02:38:50,360 --> 02:38:59,800
But first of all, we want you to arrange with the NSA a new intelligence system where

1419
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:12,600
what is reported of interest to Jerry Ford is what he wants, and not what the CIA thinks he ought to want.

1420
02:39:14,600 --> 02:39:24,280
So, I did that. The next morning, at 6 a.m., I'm living in Georgetown at the time,

1421
02:39:24,280 --> 02:39:31,400
somebody knocking on my door. I'm sent by the Director of the NSA to give me a morning brief.

1422
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:40,360
Every day, I had, you know, I prefer to get up just a hair later. But anyway,

1423
02:39:41,960 --> 02:39:49,080
and I said, well, Jerry Ford doesn't need to know about the new mistress for the French Prime Minister.

1424
02:39:49,080 --> 02:39:56,280
It's not really up his alley. What we do need to know is important things like

1425
02:39:58,200 --> 02:40:07,800
Russian bookings for ships that might have capacity to move a lot of hours range because

1426
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:15,960
you're worried about inflation. So, I went through a list of such things. Oh, this is wonderful.

1427
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:23,160
A few weeks after that, the head of NSA, you know, some general, I don't remember his name now,

1428
02:40:24,200 --> 02:40:34,680
told me, can you have lunch over here? Okay. And he said, you're the best client NSA has ever had.

1429
02:40:35,400 --> 02:40:41,560
You're telling us what you need. We have huge resources, but we never know what the client wants.

1430
02:40:42,520 --> 02:40:48,520
So, we feed them all kinds of stuff and we give it to CIA and then they decide what might be of

1431
02:40:48,520 --> 02:40:57,000
interest to them. And they emphasize the love life of most important people. That sounds like a CIA

1432
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:03,880
thing to do or just go for the compromise or something. You know, it keeps your attention.

1433
02:41:03,960 --> 02:41:11,720
But I'm told that your reconfiguration of the intelligence that goes into the presidential

1434
02:41:11,720 --> 02:41:20,520
daily briefing remains and that the NSA continues to have that input, which they did not have before

1435
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:28,760
that time. Wow. I can't prove that myself, but that's when I'm dead to believe. After I left

1436
02:41:28,760 --> 02:41:36,440
government. Well, real quick, Harold, I do want to stick on the Townsend Brown Tesla collaboration.

1437
02:41:36,440 --> 02:41:39,480
So, do you know anything about the nature of that collaboration?

1438
02:41:43,480 --> 02:41:55,240
About anti-gravity motion. Wow. And so, Tesla stumbled on this stuff as well because they

1439
02:41:55,240 --> 02:42:03,400
were both working with high-voltage electricity. Yeah. I really would like to read

1440
02:42:04,040 --> 02:42:11,560
such as workbooks, but they're all in the hands of you can't have access.

1441
02:42:11,560 --> 02:42:18,360
You know who was tasked with retrieving Tesla's files? John Trump, who was an MIT professor,

1442
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:22,840
the world's or the country's leading radar expert at the time and Donald Trump's uncle.

1443
02:42:22,840 --> 02:42:27,160
Yeah, but he passed them over. Didn't need to enable the intelligence. Isn't that right?

1444
02:42:27,960 --> 02:42:33,400
I don't know. That's interesting. And that goes towards your theories around this stuff. And

1445
02:42:33,400 --> 02:42:39,400
I'm pretty sure Townsend Brown's stuff was classified by the Navy. Yes. Yeah, it had to

1446
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:43,640
be because he was working on submarines. He was. Yeah. And he was part of the Navy

1447
02:42:44,280 --> 02:42:49,720
up until 1942 when Skunk Works started. And then he joined Martin Vega Corporation,

1448
02:42:49,720 --> 02:42:53,800
but maybe he was still working for the Navy because he showed up two weeks after

1449
02:42:53,800 --> 02:42:58,280
leaving the Navy. And he sort of left, you know, they said that they dismissed him,

1450
02:42:58,280 --> 02:43:02,360
but like he had an amazing record. And there's even an FBI file from the time saying he was

1451
02:43:02,360 --> 02:43:06,600
the country's leading radar expert. So there's something around that story. That's very

1452
02:43:06,600 --> 02:43:13,080
interesting. It is fascinating too, that the public are clamoring for the release of the JFK

1453
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:19,800
file, but still no talk of the Tesla papers. Yeah, nobody talks about it. And so what's in there

1454
02:43:19,800 --> 02:43:26,280
that's of such great importance? Well, Tesla's another guy. He said he spoke, he communicated

1455
02:43:26,280 --> 02:43:31,880
with aliens in Colorado Springs and people just, I think they assume that's the quacky part of his

1456
02:43:31,880 --> 02:43:35,560
work or whatever. They assume that that's ridiculous or whatever, but he said that.

1457
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:41,880
You know, so, and then Townsend Brown would constantly talk about, you know, space brothers

1458
02:43:42,440 --> 02:43:47,080
and communication with aliens. He would sleep next to what he called a shortwave radio.

1459
02:43:47,080 --> 02:43:49,800
He claimed that that was how he communicated with them.

1460
02:43:52,520 --> 02:43:59,800
It's quite possible that there was communication improvised, different ways of, is there a way to

1461
02:43:59,800 --> 02:44:08,520
communicate? A shortwave radio would be one not so hard to do, harder is to get in somebody's head

1462
02:44:08,520 --> 02:44:14,440
telepathically, especially because we don't grow up thinking that way.

1463
02:44:16,440 --> 02:44:21,720
And yet the US government spent a fair amount of time and money on exactly that issue over the

1464
02:44:21,720 --> 02:44:28,760
years. Well, to the extent that they learned anything between that and LSB, we'll never know,

1465
02:44:28,760 --> 02:44:34,760
but they have some knowledge. Yeah, because this is an interesting kind of question,

1466
02:44:34,760 --> 02:44:39,160
because Stargate, this psychic spy program started by Hal Putoff and Russell Targ,

1467
02:44:39,720 --> 02:44:45,000
originally most of the guys working on that were part of the technical staff services, the CIA,

1468
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:51,640
and it was people like Sidney Gottlieb and a lot of his comrades who were working on this stuff,

1469
02:44:51,640 --> 02:44:58,040
and then post church commission that kind of changed. But yeah, how far do you think we

1470
02:44:58,040 --> 02:45:05,160
went when it came to kind of mind control? It's clear that one intelligence modality is being

1471
02:45:05,160 --> 02:45:11,160
able to remote view, draw up Russian nuclear bases, find hostages, all sorts of things like that.

1472
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:17,880
Even Jimmy Carter is on record saying the craziest thing of my presidency from 1976 to 1980 was

1473
02:45:17,880 --> 02:45:24,200
actually this woman, Rosemary Smith, finding a downed TU-22 Russian cargo plane, and she was

1474
02:45:24,200 --> 02:45:29,640
given all of Africa as a target, and she circled three square miles in Zaire, and they found the

1475
02:45:29,640 --> 02:45:37,320
plane. And the next time one of our space satellites went over that area, we located the plane where

1476
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:43,720
she said it was. So that's clear, but do you think we've gone farther in their sort of mind

1477
02:45:43,720 --> 02:45:50,680
control techniques that we have? Very nicely, but we don't know, do we? Yeah. Personally,

1478
02:45:50,680 --> 02:45:58,520
when I think about always being at some critical point, all these interconnectivities for men,

1479
02:45:59,400 --> 02:46:09,800
I keep looking for where's the direction coming from. I mean, I don't feel any direct

1480
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:19,400
sensing. On the other hand, when I grew up, my mother was a powerful personality,

1481
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:27,240
brain. I mean, she could read my mind. She said, why did you do that? And I was like, I don't

1482
02:46:27,240 --> 02:46:36,600
remember doing that. Yes, you do. Let me see. It was 3rd of January, 1942 or something, you know.

1483
02:46:37,320 --> 02:46:45,960
And how did she do that? She could do it, but I couldn't do that with her. But on the other hand,

1484
02:46:45,960 --> 02:46:53,080
I sometimes feel that there's this hand over me that's leaning a little left or leaning a little

1485
02:46:53,080 --> 02:47:01,720
right. That's as close as I have to it. And now you feel maybe somewhat guided to look into a lot

1486
02:47:02,200 --> 02:47:08,360
of this, you know, Townsend Brown and UFOs. I feel guided. And why did I hear about that? Because

1487
02:47:09,160 --> 02:47:15,480
I showed a deep interest. I sent a tweet saying, why is it I can't see

1488
02:47:17,080 --> 02:47:28,680
Tesla's work? Why? What's so important? To be honest, as a semi-scientist, let's call that,

1489
02:47:29,480 --> 02:47:40,280
and I respect the work of Albert Einstein, but his work are conceptual and theoretic,

1490
02:47:40,840 --> 02:47:50,920
drawing on math. Tesla was very much hands-on when he's learned about electricity, its application.

1491
02:47:50,920 --> 02:48:02,440
In everything, the movement of electrons that far transcends powering lights in your room,

1492
02:48:05,480 --> 02:48:15,800
which led him into physical movement, transposition, whatever term you want to use.

1493
02:48:16,760 --> 02:48:21,560
But all that is buried, but he was way, way out there. I mean, in my mind,

1494
02:48:23,960 --> 02:48:29,880
he was equal to or even stronger than Einstein. I agree with that.

1495
02:48:32,120 --> 02:48:37,240
Well, Einstein was never an experimentalist. Tesla was dealing real experiment.

1496
02:48:37,880 --> 02:48:44,280
If I say, he was cerebral. It was all mental conceptual.

1497
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:49,240
To me, it's almost like Einstein put a governor on our physical progress in reality.

1498
02:48:50,680 --> 02:48:58,360
I agree with that. He made physics go that way, whereas Tesla was trying to pull the physics that

1499
02:48:58,360 --> 02:49:04,280
way. Yes, and the experimentalists make the most progress, and often they're poor theoreticians,

1500
02:49:04,280 --> 02:49:08,200
and they don't actually have the proper frameworks to really understand what they're doing.

1501
02:49:09,160 --> 02:49:21,640
They're operating at the boundaries of human knowledge, and often it's with high-energy

1502
02:49:21,640 --> 02:49:26,120
physics or particle accelerators, things like that, where we're doing things in the physical

1503
02:49:26,120 --> 02:49:34,840
world that are breaking prior limits. Sometimes it's in microscopy and just getting to lower

1504
02:49:34,840 --> 02:49:41,400
levels of granularity, but I think that begets so much more progress than guys with chalkboards,

1505
02:49:41,400 --> 02:49:45,480
just like writing equations. This comes up against another issue,

1506
02:49:45,480 --> 02:49:53,080
and you and I were talking with Eric Weinstein the other day about this, which is, did we create a

1507
02:49:54,680 --> 02:50:02,920
invisible glass or perspex wall? Many technologies, particularly in the nuclear space,

1508
02:50:03,560 --> 02:50:09,400
were placed on the other side, and so you could only study them or get involved with them if you

1509
02:50:09,400 --> 02:50:15,640
had a classified status and you joined a government lab or an approved academic lab.

1510
02:50:15,640 --> 02:50:20,920
But if you tried to do things with nuclear physics in your garage, you were going to be arrested,

1511
02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:23,960
and people have been arrested over the years for attempting these things.

1512
02:50:24,760 --> 02:50:31,320
Well, that pushed a lot of theoretical physics into the don't touch

1513
02:50:32,600 --> 02:50:42,840
arena, and now because of incredible advancements in computational power in

1514
02:50:43,880 --> 02:50:52,520
the kind of devices that gather data, basically you can't lock it away the way you used to.

1515
02:50:52,520 --> 02:50:59,800
People are able to uncover it, and maybe that is part of also what is causing this UAP issue

1516
02:50:59,800 --> 02:51:05,800
to bubble up to the surface, is because it's very hard to keep a lock on it now. You can classify

1517
02:51:05,800 --> 02:51:10,520
the Tesla papers, but human beings are still starting to figure out what Tesla figured out,

1518
02:51:11,080 --> 02:51:17,640
and today there's been talk of, for example, Andreessen and Horowitz, who are two of the

1519
02:51:17,640 --> 02:51:24,120
leading venture capitalists alive today, who have recently been discussing the previous

1520
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:30,280
administration's attitude towards math, because they don't want some teenager coming up with an

1521
02:51:30,280 --> 02:51:35,320
artificial intelligence that would have wide-ranging consequences, so they started to think we could

1522
02:51:35,320 --> 02:51:38,920
lock that down. You know, one of the things we argued in our meeting with the White House

1523
02:51:38,920 --> 02:51:42,840
on AI policy was, you know, look, there are going to be issues that come from AI, but they should

1524
02:51:42,840 --> 02:51:46,120
be regulated. The regulation should happen at the application level, not at the technology level.

1525
02:51:46,440 --> 02:51:47,800
And he argued with me when I said that.

1526
02:51:49,480 --> 02:51:52,680
So Ben basically said, look, it doesn't make sense, because to regulate AI at the technology

1527
02:51:52,680 --> 02:51:55,880
level, you're regulating math, and of course, we're not going to do that. That doesn't make

1528
02:51:55,880 --> 02:51:59,880
any sense, and you'll recall that what they said was, no, actually.

1529
02:51:59,880 --> 02:52:01,080
We can classify math.

1530
02:52:01,080 --> 02:52:08,040
We can classify math, and literally, this is verbatim. We classified whole entire areas of

1531
02:52:08,040 --> 02:52:15,160
physics in the nuclear era and made them state secrets of the theoretical physics.

1532
02:52:15,960 --> 02:52:17,000
Science and physics.

1533
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:18,040
And they're like, wait, what?

1534
02:52:18,040 --> 02:52:21,240
They're like, what? Yeah, like, physics is supposed to be open source.

1535
02:52:21,240 --> 02:52:27,160
And so you start to wonder, is Eric Weinstein right that physics went down a certain road

1536
02:52:27,160 --> 02:52:28,760
because there was a wall?

1537
02:52:28,760 --> 02:52:29,320
Yes.

1538
02:52:29,320 --> 02:52:33,800
And now the weight of new innovations is crushing that wall.

1539
02:52:34,600 --> 02:52:41,480
Well, that brings, you know, another Explain That Tweet series. So we have, Harold, you wrote,

1540
02:52:42,120 --> 02:52:47,960
questions appearing regarding successor to AEC. AEC is the Atomic Energy Commission.

1541
02:52:47,960 --> 02:52:53,000
Department of Energy now oversees all national labs, including nuke research and security.

1542
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:57,800
National labs also include advanced research on other potential security threats,

1543
02:52:57,800 --> 02:53:03,960
such as biotech, all subject to DOE, Department of Energy, R&D classifications.

1544
02:53:03,960 --> 02:53:08,200
So are you saying here that our most advanced science is not occurring

1545
02:53:09,160 --> 02:53:17,240
in the labs or hallways of MIT, Harvard, Stanford, but in fact, at these DOE research facilities?

1546
02:53:18,280 --> 02:53:18,520
Yes.

1547
02:53:22,600 --> 02:53:24,280
I guess that's just a Mike Girard moment.

1548
02:53:25,800 --> 02:53:27,160
Let me give you an example.

1549
02:53:29,160 --> 02:53:33,080
I became really close friends with Howard, Senator Howard Baker.

1550
02:53:33,080 --> 02:53:39,320
I mean, he would have made a great president. Anyway,

1551
02:53:43,480 --> 02:53:53,160
I worked with him, talked to him a lot. We became friends. He had me and my wife of that time

1552
02:53:53,880 --> 02:54:01,400
down at his country house several times. And he said one day,

1553
02:54:03,240 --> 02:54:09,880
I wanted to go up to Oak Ridge and spend some time with them. And I said,

1554
02:54:10,440 --> 02:54:16,920
oh, I didn't know you were attached with them. I thought you were attached with Tennessee Valley.

1555
02:54:17,880 --> 02:54:25,000
He said, yeah, but I live in Tennessee. I'm nearby. You can imagine that we are intimately

1556
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:33,560
interconnected. I would like you to spend a few days talking to them about the technologies

1557
02:54:33,560 --> 02:54:38,920
they're working on that might be made commercialized in some way or other,

1558
02:54:38,920 --> 02:54:45,240
because they don't have that in their work agenda. They just develop and develop.

1559
02:54:45,320 --> 02:54:49,960
But he said, I just have a feeling that a lot of that should be made public.

1560
02:54:51,960 --> 02:55:00,280
So I did. And they had really interesting stuff going on, areas that you'd never think of.

1561
02:55:01,080 --> 02:55:08,760
The most impressive one was when somebody said, we know more about filters than anybody in the

1562
02:55:08,760 --> 02:55:20,360
world. I said filters. I said filters for the water supplies and filters of molecules, filters

1563
02:55:21,080 --> 02:55:35,480
of any moving elements of our system. And we don't have a purpose for all of this,

1564
02:55:35,480 --> 02:55:42,520
but they're very important in developing refining nuclear weapons. That's why we do it.

1565
02:55:44,120 --> 02:55:53,080
I said it's a great value in biotech and in the management of the water supply is only one of

1566
02:55:53,080 --> 02:56:00,680
many things. But it should be, well, we don't have a mechanism for generalizing what we're doing.

1567
02:56:01,160 --> 02:56:11,720
And it's too much work to say, let's be regular. So we don't want to get tangled up with all that

1568
02:56:11,720 --> 02:56:21,400
stuff in Washington. So we just do what we're doing. It stuck in my mind. And why it stuck?

1569
02:56:22,360 --> 02:56:33,320
When AT&T was on the eve of being broken up, AT&T hired me as the final witness before

1570
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:44,600
Judge Harold Green. And I got into, the United States is not ready for a total breakup because,

1571
02:56:44,600 --> 02:56:52,280
number one, Bell Labs is where all our really advanced science is. How do you know that?

1572
02:56:52,280 --> 02:56:57,240
Because I went to Bell Labs. I spent a week there. I'm telling you that's where all the brain power

1573
02:56:57,240 --> 02:57:07,080
is. And I said the second reason is our industry, we don't have Panasonic and all these other

1574
02:57:07,080 --> 02:57:12,920
companies ready to build all the phones for all the offices. We're not ready.

1575
02:57:13,880 --> 02:57:19,720
So if you're going to do this, it should be done in stages. The Department of Justice guy kept

1576
02:57:19,720 --> 02:57:27,240
getting up. I object to this testimony. It's not part of the case. And Judge Green shut them down

1577
02:57:27,240 --> 02:57:33,240
and said, he's the first man to talk about anything relevant and of interest to me as a human being.

1578
02:57:33,240 --> 02:57:38,600
So just let him talk. Do you believe, because we're talking about Bell Labs, that's part of

1579
02:57:38,600 --> 02:57:44,200
this narrative of this guy, Philip J. Corso, who was working in the army on what he claims to be

1580
02:57:44,200 --> 02:57:50,600
the Foreign Material Exploitation Desk. He says that as part of that role, basically crash materials

1581
02:57:50,600 --> 02:57:56,200
from Roswell were given to him to dole out to private industry. And mainly it was given to

1582
02:57:57,080 --> 02:58:04,840
Bell Labs. He says that Kevlar, lasers, and transistors were all derivative of this alien

1583
02:58:04,840 --> 02:58:13,640
technology. Should be. So you'd say possible, but you don't have any evidence for that? No,

1584
02:58:13,640 --> 02:58:19,000
but it should be. Okay. Let me interject. Something that keeps coming up in conversation

1585
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:27,960
about this issue is I hear a lot of, Pippa, look for the technologies where there's no on-ramp.

1586
02:58:28,680 --> 02:58:32,920
I go, what do you mean on-ramp? I mean, you can't find the research history

1587
02:58:33,480 --> 02:58:40,040
that led to it. Those are the interesting ones to pay attention to. They're not saying it's

1588
02:58:40,040 --> 02:58:45,240
definitely from this particular story. They're just saying the ones that come out of nowhere,

1589
02:58:45,960 --> 02:58:53,080
those have interesting stories. So fascinating. And Harold, do you believe, because you're

1590
02:58:53,080 --> 02:58:57,880
interested in Townsend Brown to begin with, presumably the source gave you this information

1591
02:58:57,880 --> 02:59:02,600
on Townsend Brown collaborating with Tesla, which if that's true, that is remarkable

1592
02:59:02,600 --> 02:59:09,720
and needs to be known more broadly. Do you think that Townsend Brown discovered anti-gravity?

1593
02:59:11,720 --> 02:59:21,800
I don't know, but somebody just posted on the internet the workbooks of Townsend Brown,

1594
02:59:24,440 --> 02:59:32,200
and I downloaded the whole thing. It turns out to be 500 pages. I have it on my telephone.

1595
02:59:32,200 --> 02:59:34,600
He's very excited about it. That's amazing.

1596
02:59:35,880 --> 02:59:37,480
I'm going to go through that. Yeah.

1597
02:59:39,640 --> 02:59:45,480
Somewhere in there, I'm going to find something. So I can't answer your question right now.

1598
02:59:50,440 --> 02:59:57,800
But I think Tesla anyway was on this track of movement of electrons

1599
02:59:57,800 --> 03:00:04,280
and allowed repositioning of just about anything.

1600
03:00:05,800 --> 03:00:07,400
What exactly does that mean?

1601
03:00:08,280 --> 03:00:12,920
It's the term transmutation.

1602
03:00:14,600 --> 03:00:22,040
Interesting. Of elements. So that's so interesting because when I go deep enough on the Townsend

1603
03:00:22,040 --> 03:00:28,040
Brown stuff with certain scientists, they'll say that it gets into that, the transmutation of

1604
03:00:28,040 --> 03:00:34,440
elements thing, and that's actually why this stuff was shut down because there are more dangerous

1605
03:00:35,720 --> 03:00:39,320
implications around that than the anti-gravity stuff.

1606
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:46,440
Well, look at today. Again, I'm a bit involved in the world of artificial intelligence. We already

1607
03:00:46,440 --> 03:00:53,480
are able to create what are called programmable materials where you can specify the behavior of

1608
03:00:53,480 --> 03:01:00,440
the material and use materials as a data transmission mechanism. So suddenly you're

1609
03:01:00,440 --> 03:01:09,400
dealing with things and capabilities that don't fit traditional parameters. Let's add to that that

1610
03:01:10,360 --> 03:01:20,920
because of Google's new Sycamore supercomputer and their new Willow chip, they're already

1611
03:01:20,920 --> 03:01:27,960
discovering basically the recipes for creating new materials atom by atom by atom, which is a

1612
03:01:27,960 --> 03:01:34,760
revolution in human history. Because in the past, you had to start with a tree to make a table out

1613
03:01:34,840 --> 03:01:42,040
of wood or a boat, right? But today you can start with what is the requirement? What are the

1614
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:50,600
characteristics that I need? And then build that material atom by atom by atom. So suddenly,

1615
03:01:50,600 --> 03:01:55,640
I mean, we have, I think they've said 380,000 new materials and 2 million new crystals

1616
03:01:55,640 --> 03:02:03,320
that no one's ever worked with before. And this will only continue now. So these ideas that you

1617
03:02:03,320 --> 03:02:09,880
can have materials that do strange things is no longer insane, like we're building them.

1618
03:02:09,880 --> 03:02:17,000
What this allows you to do is to devise it in here and make it over there.

1619
03:02:18,040 --> 03:02:19,080
Also, yes.

1620
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:23,480
So you can make it anywhere once you have the concept. It's a cookbook.

1621
03:02:23,480 --> 03:02:24,280
It's a cookbook.

1622
03:02:33,880 --> 03:02:42,200
Okay, so the JFK administration, you're this young whiz kid and you see this kind of rupture

1623
03:02:42,200 --> 03:02:49,320
in the administration where JFK says he's going to scout the CIA to the winds. Dulles gets fired.

1624
03:02:49,320 --> 03:02:53,800
He's kind of licking his wounds back at the Brown Brothers Harriman, which is this firm that sort of

1625
03:02:53,800 --> 03:02:59,480
formed the CIA to begin with. And he is plotting possible revenge against JFK?

1626
03:02:59,480 --> 03:03:00,440
Probably.

1627
03:03:01,400 --> 03:03:09,160
What do you think happens from there? Do you think Dulles had anything to do with JFK's assassination?

1628
03:03:11,800 --> 03:03:17,800
Well, they say they are going to release all those papers now.

1629
03:03:17,800 --> 03:03:18,280
That's right.

1630
03:03:19,080 --> 03:03:27,720
So we'll see. But what does all those papers mean? I mean, like one version or all the versions?

1631
03:03:28,680 --> 03:03:31,720
Have you ever met a guy named Danny Sheehan by any chance?

1632
03:03:31,720 --> 03:03:33,720
I've never known him.

1633
03:03:33,720 --> 03:03:40,520
So what do you think of, because you tweeted, this was the first time I was so like, I was like,

1634
03:03:40,520 --> 03:03:47,240
wow, I'm on Harold's radar. This is amazing. You tweeted, Jesse from American Alchemy just went

1635
03:03:47,240 --> 03:03:53,800
over a lot of the history around the JFK assassination with Danny Sheehan. And so I felt

1636
03:03:53,800 --> 03:03:58,840
like that was maybe somewhat of an endorsement of the Danny Sheehan narrative of what happened.

1637
03:04:02,840 --> 03:04:10,200
Pippen knows him. Pippen knows him even better now. I'm about to know him, it seems.

1638
03:04:11,160 --> 03:04:21,560
Nice. So his narrative is that Nixon, who is head of the 5412 committee under Eisenhower,

1639
03:04:21,560 --> 03:04:27,480
along with being his VP, he was working with Howard Hughes to create this, quote unquote,

1640
03:04:27,480 --> 03:04:35,240
S-Force, which was this kind of elite kind of sleeper cell unit. And they were going to take out

1641
03:04:35,800 --> 03:04:43,080
Che Guevara and Castro. And that ends up not happening. The Bay of Pigs occurs and Eisenhower

1642
03:04:43,080 --> 03:04:51,000
leaves and JFK comes in and they sort of get rolled into these other special ops programs,

1643
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:57,320
Mongoose and Foxtrot. And then once JFK fires Dulles, Dulles is kind of licking his wounds at

1644
03:04:57,320 --> 03:05:02,840
the Brown Brothers' Harriman, and he recommissions this S-Force, which is full of these Cuban exiles

1645
03:05:02,840 --> 03:05:08,360
who've been militarized originally to take out Che Guevara and Castro, but in fact this time around

1646
03:05:08,360 --> 03:05:16,120
to take out JFK. Do you think that there's any credence to this story? There are quite a few

1647
03:05:17,080 --> 03:05:24,200
stories. When I was six years old, my father moved us to

1648
03:05:27,320 --> 03:05:34,840
first to Providence, Rhode Island, and then to a community a little further along, Narragansett Bay.

1649
03:05:35,080 --> 03:05:47,480
And suddenly I found myself in a community which was totally dominated by the Sicilian Mafia.

1650
03:05:50,200 --> 03:05:58,840
In fact, most of Rhode Island was. Interesting. And the dominant mafia figure for Boston was

1651
03:05:59,640 --> 03:06:10,840
the overseer was Providence. And I grew up in this environment where in school if one kid,

1652
03:06:10,840 --> 03:06:21,720
one male, got to be a bully out of nowhere around near closing time for school, a couple of guys,

1653
03:06:21,960 --> 03:06:29,560
a couple of guys, big guys would come in, grab him, take him out, beat the shit out of him.

1654
03:06:31,480 --> 03:06:39,320
And then they told us next day, he won't bully you anymore. And so I later on began to ask

1655
03:06:40,440 --> 03:06:48,040
the police, how does it work here? I said, no disorganized, no disorganized crime.

1656
03:06:48,280 --> 03:06:59,480
No break-ins, no bullying, no wife beating, no disorganized crime. Organized crime definitely

1657
03:06:59,480 --> 03:07:07,080
is protection. And all those stories about mafia movies, I mean, I grew up in all that. Yeah,

1658
03:07:07,080 --> 03:07:15,160
this is the way it works. And I met a lot of these people, not by culture. I wasn't even

1659
03:07:15,320 --> 03:07:23,000
Catholic, the role of Catholics. But I learned a lot about it. Now, let me tell you, it's very

1660
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:35,800
interesting to me. The first time I met the Prime Minister of Italy in 1973, along with Pete Peterson,

1661
03:07:35,800 --> 03:07:43,720
who'd been sent over by Nixon to do a kind of tour of the world, I sat down and I said,

1662
03:07:43,960 --> 03:07:52,760
I sat down. He said, Mr. Malmgren, I've been looking forward to meeting you. Pete,

1663
03:07:52,760 --> 03:07:59,320
you won't understand this. Let me explain. How he knows all about the Sicilian way.

1664
03:08:00,760 --> 03:08:11,400
He grew up in it. He understands it. I know what he knows. So let me explain before you start some

1665
03:08:11,400 --> 03:08:19,720
lecture on the confusion of state and crime in Italy. We had all these

1666
03:08:22,040 --> 03:08:29,960
communist troublemakers, red brigades, all kinds of stuff. The only way the church

1667
03:08:29,960 --> 03:08:37,400
and the state could fight, we had to use the mafia. Because they could do things we couldn't do.

1668
03:08:37,960 --> 03:08:39,160
Okay.

1669
03:08:39,160 --> 03:08:48,280
So, yes, there was a triumvirate that ran Italy for a long time, and it was an alliance of the

1670
03:08:48,280 --> 03:08:53,640
Pope, the Vatican, the elected government, and the Sicilian mafia.

1671
03:08:55,000 --> 03:09:00,760
We'll let the audience interpret that analogy as an answer to the JFK question.

1672
03:09:01,240 --> 03:09:10,040
When I met, Chris Hooter had been governor of Massachusetts before he, he'd been in Congress

1673
03:09:10,040 --> 03:09:15,880
and governor of Massachusetts before he became secretary of state. So I asked him one day, I

1674
03:09:15,880 --> 03:09:24,520
said, how did you ever do that? I said, you're a straight shooter. Why did you ever take that job

1675
03:09:25,480 --> 03:09:31,480
as governor of Massachusetts? He said, what do you mean? I said, you can't run

1676
03:09:33,080 --> 03:09:37,560
the state of Massachusetts without running Boston. You can't run Boston without

1677
03:09:37,560 --> 03:09:45,160
the mafia. He said, oh, you asked the same question my wife asked me. Why are you

1678
03:09:46,680 --> 03:09:52,680
doing this stupid thing? Why do you want to take it on? He said, I puzzled, I thought, I thought,

1679
03:09:52,680 --> 03:09:59,320
and decided I'm going to establish a principle, and it worked for me. I said, what was the

1680
03:09:59,320 --> 03:10:09,480
principle? I announced that I will not meet with anyone for any reason outside government without

1681
03:10:09,480 --> 03:10:16,680
members of the press president. And he said, no one from the mafia could come to talk to me

1682
03:10:16,680 --> 03:10:26,600
without me inviting the president. So they had to use indirection. And I could always rave them

1683
03:10:26,600 --> 03:10:32,040
off saying, I don't, I'm not going to even say, is that a threat? I'm going to ignore you. He said,

1684
03:10:32,040 --> 03:10:39,240
I just insulated myself totally. And he was independently wealthy as well. So he couldn't

1685
03:10:39,720 --> 03:10:45,800
be bought. He said, they can't touch me. I'm really wealthy. So I thought they asked me,

1686
03:10:45,800 --> 03:10:52,360
how are you going to spare me a little money? But I think it's so interesting. How did the

1687
03:10:52,360 --> 03:10:58,680
prime minister of Italy know? And the answer must be that because you grew up in that community,

1688
03:10:59,800 --> 03:11:04,040
they knew you, they knew your dad. I never told anybody about it. He knew all about it.

1689
03:11:04,040 --> 03:11:06,280
So that's a different network.

1690
03:11:34,120 --> 03:11:42,440
Coming from me to see the archbishop. We were over there. Martinkas, former archbishop of Chicago.

1691
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:55,720
Big guy, tall in his black robe, cowboy boots, leaning back, smoking a big fat Cuban cigar.

1692
03:11:55,720 --> 03:12:03,720
He saw it up the same way. He read all about you. He wanted to meet you. And Mr. Howell,

1693
03:12:03,720 --> 03:12:12,760
I think he said, here, he understands everything. But so bear with me. I will explain to you.

1694
03:12:12,760 --> 03:12:20,120
Howell will explain more if you have questions later. And I looked up and he said, we know about

1695
03:12:20,120 --> 03:12:30,520
you from your boyhood with a lot of our associates in the mafia. So then he proceeded to

1696
03:12:30,520 --> 03:12:36,040
talk about the tripartite way of defending themselves against communism.

1697
03:12:37,560 --> 03:12:44,200
I remember coming out of the pizza. How does he know all that? I said, search me. I don't know.

1698
03:12:44,200 --> 03:12:55,960
But there was movement between Sicily and people living near where I was. And I met a lot of these

1699
03:12:55,960 --> 03:13:02,920
people. They never said, boy, when you grow up, you can be one of us. I wasn't one of them. I wasn't

1700
03:13:03,640 --> 03:13:08,120
Catholic. I wasn't something. Anyway, it was interesting.

1701
03:13:08,840 --> 03:13:15,800
Well, it sounds like the Italian government and the Vatican were tied into,

1702
03:13:15,800 --> 03:13:23,240
they had mob ties in the US. And that connectivity allowed them to understand who you were

1703
03:13:23,240 --> 03:13:25,560
to begin with. That's amazing.

1704
03:13:28,200 --> 03:13:35,240
Do you think there's like a deeper layer to politics that people are unaware of that,

1705
03:13:35,320 --> 03:13:40,920
you know, I mean, even outside of the talks of like a quote unquote deep state or, you know,

1706
03:13:41,640 --> 03:13:46,120
unelected bureaucrats running the government? Like, is there something even deeper at play

1707
03:13:46,120 --> 03:13:47,560
that's sort of transnational?

1708
03:14:05,720 --> 03:14:08,280
You could call Putin right now, this minute.

1709
03:14:09,400 --> 03:14:15,560
Really? You have you have a direct line to him right now?

1710
03:14:27,720 --> 03:14:32,040
Yep. And they were trying to establish a back channel and Obama shut down the back channel that

1711
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:33,800
Yeah.

1712
03:14:38,040 --> 03:14:41,960
We've probably never needed this back channel more than we do today.

1713
03:14:42,520 --> 03:14:48,840
Harold understood Putin's psychology. And with tensions between the US, Russia and China running

1714
03:14:48,840 --> 03:14:55,080
high, Harold's deep expertise on nuclear game theory, and his former close friendship with

1715
03:14:55,080 --> 03:14:59,400
conflict escalation expert Herman Kahn would be eminently useful.

1716
03:15:02,040 --> 03:15:17,960
I was identified early as the person whose name they were familiar with, the chess player.

1717
03:15:19,480 --> 03:15:30,520
And it builds slowly. In 1982 or something, I was with Kissinger and George Jills and a

1718
03:15:30,520 --> 03:15:42,360
couple of other people in Moscow. As an aide, we were invited to watch the ballet and we came

1719
03:15:42,360 --> 03:15:53,320
and we were going to be seated in the Tsar's box. And Kissinger, as usual, marched ahead of

1720
03:15:53,320 --> 03:16:03,320
everybody and went to the seat of the Tsar. And one of the HGV people said, Henry, not tonight.

1721
03:16:04,440 --> 03:16:11,000
Not tonight. That seat is for Dr. Malamudin. And he said, what?

1722
03:16:12,760 --> 03:16:20,600
There must be some misunderstanding. He said, no, no, we know him. He is the shadow of his uncle.

1723
03:16:21,320 --> 03:16:30,680
You are not one of the world's great chess players. You may think you are. And he may not be

1724
03:16:30,680 --> 03:16:37,320
yet, but he comes from that bloodline. And in honor of him, he will sit in that chair tonight.

1725
03:16:37,880 --> 03:16:40,920
Now, it was intended humiliation of Kissinger.

1726
03:16:40,920 --> 03:16:43,160
Yeah, Kissinger must have not been very happy.

1727
03:16:43,160 --> 03:16:44,120
I think he melts it down.

1728
03:16:45,320 --> 03:16:50,120
I was already at war with Kissinger on other issues. He really got pissed off.

1729
03:16:51,080 --> 03:16:57,480
He tried not to show it, but it was out of proportion. Preposterous.

1730
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:04,520
Anyway, yeah, he didn't forget it. I didn't forget it, but I never rubbed it in.

1731
03:17:06,360 --> 03:17:19,160
As the Soviet system was collapsing, the Russian Republic was falling together and Yeltsin became

1732
03:17:21,080 --> 03:17:31,480
the first president. At that time, 1992, I was invited to a meeting in St. Petersburg,

1733
03:17:32,840 --> 03:17:43,240
Russia, by the mayor of St. Petersburg. At that time, the deputy mayor was Vladimir Putin.

1734
03:17:43,880 --> 03:17:57,560
And a number of Americans, from business and diplomats and top Soviet officials,

1735
03:17:58,600 --> 03:18:05,720
outgoing, incoming Russian officials, heavily loaded with what they call the

1736
03:18:05,880 --> 03:18:12,520
syloviki, the security people, who were looking for new careers.

1737
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:25,800
Gathering, I don't know, 75, maybe up to 100 people in the hall as the meeting opened before

1738
03:18:25,800 --> 03:18:33,240
you have drinks and before you sit down and all that. And somebody comes to grab me and I

1739
03:18:33,240 --> 03:18:44,840
recognize him, Evgeny Primakov. Primakov, who was he? He was officially a national academic

1740
03:18:45,480 --> 03:18:51,000
council or something. He was an official body supervising research in all fields.

1741
03:18:52,120 --> 03:19:01,800
And he was in charge of Asia from China to the Middle East. But he had known KGB connections.

1742
03:19:02,760 --> 03:19:11,560
In fact, many people thought he was a fee official. Anyway, I had met him in earlier years

1743
03:19:13,320 --> 03:19:20,040
and he grabbed me by the elbow and marched me over. Somebody you need to meet.

1744
03:19:21,880 --> 03:19:30,600
And he introduced me to Putin. He said, this man is rising. He will soon be very important

1745
03:19:31,560 --> 03:19:38,840
you should know him. Now I knew enough to realize that that was not an accidental meeting.

1746
03:19:39,480 --> 03:19:46,600
Primakov looked for me, found me in the crowd, brought me over. It was intentional.

1747
03:19:48,520 --> 03:19:53,480
Now Putin was standing there talking to Kissinger. He did know Kissinger.

1748
03:19:54,360 --> 03:20:02,200
And Primakov says, excuse me Henry, but Vladimir needs to know someone else.

1749
03:20:03,160 --> 03:20:06,360
He has no reason. How the hell did you get into that?

1750
03:20:09,480 --> 03:20:15,320
Anyway, he drew me away from Kissinger. Kissinger believed he was the only channel

1751
03:20:15,320 --> 03:20:25,880
and it was through Primakov. But Dobrin may have done this with more than me, but

1752
03:20:28,200 --> 03:20:33,080
I had a channel directly with the Russians at his choice.

1753
03:20:36,360 --> 03:20:43,160
But he introduced me to Primakov when I went to Moscow. Primakov wanted to get to know me.

1754
03:20:43,880 --> 03:20:55,480
I was treated not as partisan of anything, but as someone who should be trusted to carry an idea,

1755
03:20:55,480 --> 03:21:03,640
explore it, and get an answer back. That's something different. I was very mindful of

1756
03:21:03,640 --> 03:21:10,680
not getting cross-mised with our intelligence system. Kissinger thought he was the number one

1757
03:21:10,760 --> 03:21:17,320
the number one communication channel between Russia and America, in the back channel.

1758
03:21:18,200 --> 03:21:23,000
There's a history of why he and I had a conflict, a very elaborate history.

1759
03:21:27,160 --> 03:21:34,520
Because of my assignments in his presidential election, it all really related to the

1760
03:21:34,760 --> 03:21:47,960
the large role in U.S. trade legislation that had a restriction on opening trade relations with Russia

1761
03:21:48,680 --> 03:21:57,480
because of the Russian treatment of emigres of Jews from Russia to either to the U.S. or to

1762
03:21:58,440 --> 03:22:06,360
Israel. For a while, I worked with the Senate, and Senator Abe Ribicoff

1763
03:22:08,440 --> 03:22:18,280
was the senior Jewish political leader in the American system. As Abe told me,

1764
03:22:18,600 --> 03:22:29,880
Jake Jamies is my partner. He's number two, and the chief executive of Seagrams in New York

1765
03:22:29,880 --> 03:22:40,920
is the treasurer. It's a structure. We give guidance to AIPAC and other bodies, but we represent

1766
03:22:40,920 --> 03:22:49,880
the Jewish community, and I want you to take on the task of negotiating with the Russians

1767
03:22:49,880 --> 03:22:56,520
about this issue of Jewish emigres. I said, Abe, I'm not Jewish. He said, I knew that.

1768
03:22:57,400 --> 03:23:02,200
I've been looking for someone like you for a long time. I had to be somebody who didn't have Jewish

1769
03:23:02,200 --> 03:23:08,280
grandmothers or grandfathers or cousins. I didn't want family quarrels in the middle. I wanted

1770
03:23:08,280 --> 03:23:13,880
someone with clean hands. You're the first person I met who's as smart as us Jews.

1771
03:23:17,560 --> 03:23:24,280
So I said, well, I think that's enough. We had a laugh about that, and I did

1772
03:23:25,240 --> 03:23:29,080
act as the intermediary. In fact, I was sent

1773
03:23:29,080 --> 03:23:44,120
to Jerusalem and got briefed by Mossad, by Shin Betz. Fully, I made several days of full-fledged

1774
03:23:46,120 --> 03:23:51,960
explanation of what goes on between Israel and the U.S. in the dark world of intelligence.

1775
03:23:52,040 --> 03:23:59,880
The Russians startled the CIA. Who the hell was I? But I was operating at the request

1776
03:23:59,880 --> 03:24:04,440
of the senior political figure in the Jewish community, so nobody was going to mess with me.

1777
03:24:05,160 --> 03:24:15,160
Anyway, but the Russians were impressed by being picked out to do this out of all the different

1778
03:24:15,160 --> 03:24:24,200
people like Putin. So all of this was in play in the background. So somehow,

1779
03:24:25,640 --> 03:24:32,040
the old Soviet guard working through Yeltsin said, Putin has to meet

1780
03:24:32,040 --> 03:24:36,760
Harold. We don't understand Harold, but he always pops up in the important places.

1781
03:24:36,840 --> 03:24:38,600
Yeah, you're like Zellig or something.

1782
03:24:41,240 --> 03:24:47,880
And then you actually dine with him one-on-one. You converse with him. You talk about

1783
03:24:48,840 --> 03:24:50,920
what you learned from that relationship.

1784
03:24:50,920 --> 03:24:58,280
You can find... I wrote at the time of the invasion of Ukraine.

1785
03:25:00,600 --> 03:25:04,360
I wrote my impressions of Vladimir Putin.

1786
03:25:06,760 --> 03:25:09,400
I wrote about the results of the referendum that took place in Crimea.

1787
03:25:10,440 --> 03:25:17,480
Relying on the will of the people, I bring up the federal assembly and ask to consider the constitutional

1788
03:25:17,480 --> 03:25:26,120
law on the adoption of two new federal subjects as part of Russia. The Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.

1789
03:25:27,080 --> 03:25:36,200
I wrote two essays about Putin.

1790
03:25:37,240 --> 03:25:41,800
You should feature them on, just a little link to them, because they're very important.

1791
03:25:41,800 --> 03:25:42,600
There's so much.

1792
03:25:44,200 --> 03:25:48,760
As I said, I didn't meet Putin by accident. They arranged for me to meet him.

1793
03:25:49,640 --> 03:25:57,880
They did not ask me to write, but I did. I wrote what I thought he was up to, what he was reasoning was.

1794
03:25:57,880 --> 03:26:04,680
I didn't criticize him, praise him. All I said was, this isn't his state of mind.

1795
03:26:06,680 --> 03:26:10,040
He liked the two essays that I wrote.

1796
03:26:10,760 --> 03:26:11,560
Really?

1797
03:26:11,560 --> 03:26:14,120
How do I know? Because he read them.

1798
03:26:18,760 --> 03:26:32,360
I said, I'm now going to push a button and call the Prime Minister of Japan.

1799
03:26:36,280 --> 03:26:39,480
And then I thought, well, that's what I said. Watch.

1800
03:26:39,480 --> 03:26:52,600
And then the second, the Chief of the National Security Council in Tokyo,

1801
03:26:55,320 --> 03:26:55,960
I might know.

1802
03:26:57,000 --> 03:26:57,320
Wow.

1803
03:26:58,040 --> 03:26:58,920
Answer the book.

1804
03:27:00,360 --> 03:27:00,760
Wow.

1805
03:27:01,720 --> 03:27:05,960
So happy to talk with you. Is there something you believe?

1806
03:27:05,960 --> 03:27:09,960
I believe our President should do.

1807
03:27:13,800 --> 03:27:15,560
And I said, yes.

1808
03:27:19,880 --> 03:27:28,680
I've given him counsel to improve his speech in English, and his many beliefs and values.

1809
03:27:28,680 --> 03:27:46,200
So I would like to tell him from me to fly to New York, give an address to the General Assembly,

1810
03:27:50,200 --> 03:27:55,320
call the Good Morning America and ask for seven or eight minutes

1811
03:27:55,320 --> 03:27:57,400
of this interview.

1812
03:27:59,960 --> 03:28:07,960
And I said, suddenly, your President will become, mightily,

1813
03:28:10,360 --> 03:28:14,280
an entirely new figure in the eyes of Americans.

1814
03:28:15,720 --> 03:28:23,160
Because instead of being some main actor into the main genius,

1815
03:28:25,720 --> 03:28:30,040
you're leading robots across America.

1816
03:28:33,080 --> 03:28:35,800
They'll see him, young people,

1817
03:28:37,400 --> 03:28:43,880
other people, journalists, young staff members, and journalists.

1818
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:49,160
They'll all see the face and they'll hear his words.

1819
03:28:51,160 --> 03:28:55,000
And sure enough, suddenly, he was everybody's friend.

1820
03:28:56,120 --> 03:28:56,620
Hmm.

1821
03:28:57,320 --> 03:29:10,040
When I went from DOJ to Lyndon Johnson, I arrived in October 1964.

1822
03:29:10,040 --> 03:29:15,400
I get called over by General Counsel.

1823
03:29:15,800 --> 03:29:25,320
Well, LBJ wants you to go on a very secret mission to Tokyo.

1824
03:29:27,880 --> 03:29:30,040
To me, it's already arranged.

1825
03:29:31,480 --> 03:29:34,200
I hadn't known about it, but it's already arranged.

1826
03:29:34,200 --> 03:29:36,600
You will meet the Japanese Prime Minister.

1827
03:29:36,600 --> 03:29:41,480
He will be accompanied by some Japanese named Miyazawa,

1828
03:29:42,680 --> 03:29:44,040
whose English is perfect.

1829
03:29:44,760 --> 03:29:47,560
But he's an official in the cabinet.

1830
03:29:48,680 --> 03:29:51,320
Miyazawa recently was Prime Minister.

1831
03:29:53,320 --> 03:29:55,720
So I said, okay, what do I do?

1832
03:29:56,600 --> 03:29:59,880
He said, you will arrange the tickets.

1833
03:30:01,560 --> 03:30:04,840
You do not tell anyone in your agency what you're doing.

1834
03:30:05,480 --> 03:30:07,000
You just take some days off.

1835
03:30:08,040 --> 03:30:09,240
Chris Hooter knows.

1836
03:30:09,240 --> 03:30:11,720
He approved it and he said, you're just the right person.

1837
03:30:12,280 --> 03:30:12,840
Who knows?

1838
03:30:13,400 --> 03:30:17,240
Chris Hooter, because I was in his aid.

1839
03:30:19,080 --> 03:30:20,200
But no one else knows.

1840
03:30:21,880 --> 03:30:24,280
Don't tell anyone your agency.

1841
03:30:24,280 --> 03:30:27,560
Don't visit the American Embassy.

1842
03:30:28,760 --> 03:30:29,160
They don't know you there.

1843
03:30:29,160 --> 03:30:30,760
Don't tell the State Department.

1844
03:30:33,560 --> 03:30:34,680
Don't tell anyone.

1845
03:30:34,680 --> 03:30:39,240
You'll find the entry and exit will be handled swiftly.

1846
03:30:39,480 --> 03:30:46,760
You deliver this message and then get an answer.

1847
03:30:46,760 --> 03:30:48,600
Write it down personally.

1848
03:30:49,320 --> 03:30:53,880
When you get back, if you want to type it up, it's helpful.

1849
03:30:54,520 --> 03:30:56,760
But don't address it to the President.

1850
03:30:56,760 --> 03:30:59,240
Don't say on the envelope, eyes only.

1851
03:30:59,880 --> 03:31:02,600
It'll be jaded because then 30 people want to see it.

1852
03:31:02,600 --> 03:31:04,680
Because then 30 people want to see it.

1853
03:31:08,200 --> 03:31:09,480
I said, how do I get it?

1854
03:31:10,920 --> 03:31:13,080
Here's the name of his personal secretary.

1855
03:31:13,880 --> 03:31:15,080
She will expect it.

1856
03:31:15,080 --> 03:31:17,640
She will tell them to give her the envelope.

1857
03:31:17,640 --> 03:31:21,000
If it comes and you deliver it yourself,

1858
03:31:22,040 --> 03:31:24,360
they'll let you in the door and hand over the envelope.

1859
03:31:24,360 --> 03:31:25,240
That's it.

1860
03:31:27,080 --> 03:31:28,200
No return address.

1861
03:31:28,200 --> 03:31:30,280
Don't have your name on it, date, anything.

1862
03:31:31,160 --> 03:31:31,660
Okay.

1863
03:31:33,000 --> 03:31:40,360
Well, the origin of this was the Kennedy people

1864
03:31:40,360 --> 03:31:43,560
were all over Johnson the minute he became President.

1865
03:31:43,560 --> 03:31:48,200
Are you going to keep all the commitments of John Kennedy?

1866
03:31:49,240 --> 03:31:50,680
He said, what can I do?

1867
03:31:50,680 --> 03:31:52,280
They put pressure on this.

1868
03:31:52,280 --> 03:31:53,400
I said, of course I will.

1869
03:31:54,360 --> 03:31:56,600
But he said some of those commitments involved

1870
03:31:58,280 --> 03:31:59,560
something I don't agree with.

1871
03:31:59,560 --> 03:32:04,440
It was cracking down on imports of foreign nations of textiles.

1872
03:32:06,040 --> 03:32:11,160
It's been a delicate subject between ours and our administration.

1873
03:32:11,160 --> 03:32:15,320
We already have this elaborate system for import controls.

1874
03:32:15,320 --> 03:32:20,920
But I think this is all just to favor a certain group of people.

1875
03:32:22,200 --> 03:32:26,840
So I want to guide the dialogue with Japan.

1876
03:32:27,640 --> 03:32:32,520
So I want to say I'm not going to argue with you about this.

1877
03:32:32,520 --> 03:32:34,520
We're not going to have legislation.

1878
03:32:35,160 --> 03:32:38,600
But I really would like your cooperation

1879
03:32:39,400 --> 03:32:43,640
to ask the industry to slow the pace of expansion

1880
03:32:44,520 --> 03:32:48,840
for at least a year or two so that I don't have to address this.

1881
03:32:50,760 --> 03:32:53,320
Well, we had some other issues with Japan at the time.

1882
03:32:54,280 --> 03:32:55,960
So I met Sato.

1883
03:32:56,760 --> 03:33:02,280
And so he was quite happy and said, yes, of course.

1884
03:33:03,640 --> 03:33:05,080
Came back, passed it on.

1885
03:33:06,360 --> 03:33:08,440
No one ever knows I made that trip.

1886
03:33:09,080 --> 03:33:12,920
This is the beginning of what we now know as voluntary export restraints.

1887
03:33:13,480 --> 03:33:19,560
And it was a means of keeping the peace between the US and Japan

1888
03:33:19,560 --> 03:33:24,040
on this super politically sensitive issue for LBJ.

1889
03:33:24,040 --> 03:33:30,120
And the point is that this is often how presidents do things.

1890
03:33:30,680 --> 03:33:34,440
They don't always use the official system.

1891
03:33:34,440 --> 03:33:36,520
They have unofficial fact channels.

1892
03:33:36,520 --> 03:33:40,280
At the time, I asked the general counsel,

1893
03:33:40,280 --> 03:33:43,400
why can't you secure lines of communication?

1894
03:33:44,920 --> 03:33:48,280
He said, yeah, well, security corps has no system.

1895
03:33:49,880 --> 03:33:52,360
But a lot of people listen to it.

1896
03:33:54,920 --> 03:33:58,360
Security corps doesn't deny CIA access.

1897
03:33:59,560 --> 03:34:02,920
And then since security corps is part of the army,

1898
03:34:04,760 --> 03:34:07,240
most of the military knows whatever goes.

1899
03:34:08,200 --> 03:34:10,200
So you can't use that.

1900
03:34:10,920 --> 03:34:13,400
Not to mention the Russians and everybody else.

1901
03:34:13,400 --> 03:34:14,600
Yeah, well, let's forget about that.

1902
03:34:16,120 --> 03:34:17,240
We have all these others.

1903
03:34:17,720 --> 03:34:19,960
You say something.

1904
03:34:19,960 --> 03:34:24,520
It's just like if you ever send a message to the president saying,

1905
03:34:24,520 --> 03:34:27,960
I is only the president, it's an automatic imitation.

1906
03:34:27,960 --> 03:34:28,680
Everybody knows.

1907
03:34:31,400 --> 03:34:35,400
Before the president sees it, they'll have to see it and write a preparatory comment.

1908
03:34:39,880 --> 03:34:41,000
I'll give you an example.

1909
03:34:41,960 --> 03:34:45,400
I was given, when Nixon came in,

1910
03:34:46,120 --> 03:34:48,760
there was a special commission on the transition,

1911
03:34:49,640 --> 03:34:56,200
a bunch of papers from Dean Rusk to Johnson.

1912
03:34:59,000 --> 03:35:01,640
Nixon was coming in with Feltation C.

1913
03:35:04,200 --> 03:35:08,520
And there was a bunch of papers with letters from George Ball

1914
03:35:09,480 --> 03:35:11,640
to the president pleading with,

1915
03:35:12,360 --> 03:35:17,720
let's downsize this whole Vietnam thing before it blows up in your face.

1916
03:35:21,560 --> 03:35:26,440
Cover notes that size, stapled on from Dean Rusk.

1917
03:35:27,560 --> 03:35:31,720
Here's George at it again, trying to get in the way of what we must do.

1918
03:35:33,560 --> 03:35:36,440
I mean, Dean Rusk totally dismisses

1919
03:35:36,440 --> 03:35:38,680
it of everything.

1920
03:35:38,680 --> 03:35:40,600
Now, interesting, I was told later,

1921
03:35:43,640 --> 03:35:46,040
I'm coming out, I know this, by his daughter,

1922
03:35:46,600 --> 03:35:50,440
Linda Bird, that he really valued George Ball.

1923
03:35:51,480 --> 03:35:53,400
He read every memo of George Ball.

1924
03:35:53,400 --> 03:35:57,640
He thought he was the only guy in the foreign policy system that his brains.

1925
03:35:59,400 --> 03:36:03,160
George Ball was always opposed to heightening the war.

1926
03:36:03,880 --> 03:36:12,520
So, I mean, I knew the daughter because I dated a girl who was best friends with Linda Bird,

1927
03:36:12,520 --> 03:36:16,280
so I spent evenings with her and her boyfriend playing cards.

1928
03:36:17,400 --> 03:36:19,160
So I learned lots of stuff.

1929
03:36:19,160 --> 03:36:21,080
My own intelligent system.

1930
03:36:23,400 --> 03:36:24,520
I'm telling you.

1931
03:36:33,560 --> 03:36:34,680
I'm a human male.

1932
03:36:37,880 --> 03:36:39,960
It was sometimes beneficial.

1933
03:36:41,400 --> 03:36:47,480
I can say over a lifetime, more not beneficial.

1934
03:36:50,120 --> 03:36:56,920
Anyway, but that

1935
03:36:56,920 --> 03:37:05,800
kind of process, there was no secure way unless you sent somebody.

1936
03:37:09,560 --> 03:37:11,720
You can't do it in the way that's visible.

1937
03:37:12,360 --> 03:37:17,720
Well, I love your, in my research, your name always pops up next to Malmgren, Inc.,

1938
03:37:17,720 --> 03:37:23,480
which I always found like hilariously nondescript and non-threatening and sort of,

1939
03:37:23,480 --> 03:37:25,560
you know, just extremely generic.

1940
03:37:25,560 --> 03:37:28,520
Yeah, well, I never advertised anything specific.

1941
03:37:36,440 --> 03:37:42,520
You seem to just keep getting, having these interactions with people kind of on the inside.

1942
03:37:43,320 --> 03:37:47,240
I mean, now we're getting to trippier territory and who knows if this is correct,

1943
03:37:47,240 --> 03:37:52,040
but it's almost like a sort of mental network or a network of serendipity or something,

1944
03:37:52,040 --> 03:37:59,080
where you look at your interactions with Carl Compton as young as you were and then Richard

1945
03:37:59,080 --> 03:38:04,440
Bissell saying, it's almost like I need to tell you this for some sort of unknown reason.

1946
03:38:04,440 --> 03:38:07,000
And so there's something about that that I find fascinating.

1947
03:38:07,000 --> 03:38:08,360
Particularly on nuclear.

1948
03:38:09,000 --> 03:38:09,400
Nuclear.

1949
03:38:09,400 --> 03:38:14,440
I mean, how many Americans have sat down and had dinner with President Putin and understand

1950
03:38:15,080 --> 03:38:21,000
what he thinks about nuclear weapons and how they might be used, which I think is a story you

1951
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:23,320
should tell a little bit about.

1952
03:38:23,320 --> 03:38:31,320
Because it all goes back to the 13-year-old requesting these documents and somehow ends up.

1953
03:38:31,960 --> 03:38:34,600
Now, I've been told, but Dad won't confirm,

1954
03:38:35,720 --> 03:38:40,680
that he worked on preventing a nuclear crisis on more than one occasion.

1955
03:38:41,640 --> 03:38:43,880
But you only tell me about one.

1956
03:38:44,760 --> 03:38:49,000
And people in the intelligence world are like, oh, your dad is good.

1957
03:38:51,000 --> 03:38:52,760
What? What's going on?

1958
03:38:52,760 --> 03:38:54,440
So I won't make you go there.

1959
03:38:54,440 --> 03:39:01,880
But you have met with the leader of Russia on nuclear matters after all of this that we now know.

1960
03:39:01,880 --> 03:39:02,440
Wow.

1961
03:39:02,440 --> 03:39:07,400
This, I think, is related to the subject and it's important to discuss.

1962
03:39:08,040 --> 03:39:17,480
And today, do we have a system for de-conflicting the US and Russia if these things show up?

1963
03:39:17,480 --> 03:39:20,360
And what is happening practically as we speak?

1964
03:39:20,360 --> 03:39:23,640
We have unidentified objects flying all over the United States.

1965
03:39:23,640 --> 03:39:24,120
Yes.

1966
03:39:24,120 --> 03:39:25,320
Not just in New Jersey.

1967
03:39:25,320 --> 03:39:25,880
No.

1968
03:39:25,880 --> 03:39:30,360
Over nuclear facilities, over weapons arsenals, but it's happening globally.

1969
03:39:30,360 --> 03:39:34,120
And the speculation on the people deepest on the subject, people like Robert Hastings,

1970
03:39:34,120 --> 03:39:39,240
who wrote an amazing book called UFOs and Nukes, and all of his whistleblowers, almost 170,

1971
03:39:39,240 --> 03:39:43,960
who work, they have cue clearances at these atomic sites, their intuition.

1972
03:39:43,960 --> 03:39:48,120
You could say a whole host of things as far as why these UFOs show up.

1973
03:39:48,120 --> 03:39:52,040
You could say they're offensive, which I just don't believe because

1974
03:39:52,040 --> 03:39:54,040
they haven't really done too much that's offensive.

1975
03:39:54,040 --> 03:39:55,400
They've done really nothing.

1976
03:39:55,400 --> 03:39:57,400
Well, we shoot at them, but they don't shoot at us.

1977
03:39:57,400 --> 03:39:58,200
They don't shoot at us.

1978
03:39:59,000 --> 03:40:04,680
So all of their first intuition as to why these UFOs show up around our most sensitive sites

1979
03:40:04,680 --> 03:40:11,480
is because they're trying to show us that our ways are too brutal and we're going to blow

1980
03:40:11,480 --> 03:40:15,800
ourselves up and to kind of make us think about higher things.

1981
03:40:15,800 --> 03:40:17,640
And so I don't know if you guys think that.

1982
03:40:17,880 --> 03:40:21,000
No, I think that's what it's all about.

1983
03:40:21,800 --> 03:40:27,480
Plus, if we get too serious with nuclear explosions,

1984
03:40:28,040 --> 03:40:33,160
we can do lasting damage to the shell of the earth.

1985
03:40:34,840 --> 03:40:38,840
You know, we're plumbing deeper and deeper into the center.

1986
03:40:39,400 --> 03:40:43,640
I mean, we don't know what happens if you stop.

1987
03:40:43,640 --> 03:40:49,880
Well, there's an optimum of radiation necessary for evolution to occur.

1988
03:40:49,880 --> 03:40:50,520
Awesome.

1989
03:40:50,520 --> 03:40:54,600
Because you have this kind of intersection between the magnetosphere of the earth,

1990
03:40:54,600 --> 03:40:59,400
which actually dictates biological morphology on a pretty fundamental way,

1991
03:40:59,400 --> 03:41:02,440
and UV radiation, which creates the genetic mutations

1992
03:41:02,440 --> 03:41:04,920
necessary for natural selection, differential selection.

1993
03:41:05,480 --> 03:41:09,880
And you are messing with this sort of equilibrium every time there's a nuclear spill.

1994
03:41:09,880 --> 03:41:13,960
And the really interesting crazy part is you have a town in Japan

1995
03:41:15,000 --> 03:41:19,720
next to the Fukushima Prefecture called Lino, and it's dedicated to UFOs.

1996
03:41:20,520 --> 03:41:23,000
Over 50% of the residents all believe in UFOs.

1997
03:41:23,000 --> 03:41:25,480
There's a museum dedicated to UFOs.

1998
03:41:25,480 --> 03:41:28,440
And there, during the spill, they say the UFOs came down,

1999
03:41:28,440 --> 03:41:33,560
they helped clean up the spill, this monk who guards this temple in Japan.

2000
03:41:33,560 --> 03:41:35,160
And so it's just fascinating.

2001
03:41:35,160 --> 03:41:37,320
It's like they're the stewards of the earth.

2002
03:41:38,280 --> 03:41:39,160
There may well be.

2003
03:41:42,280 --> 03:41:47,880
It begins with the opening question, as I said.

2004
03:41:47,880 --> 03:41:56,200
I felt all the way along these unexpected interrelated events.

2005
03:41:59,080 --> 03:42:01,320
There was a message to the madness somewhere.

2006
03:42:02,200 --> 03:42:06,840
And my mother telling me, just keep doing what you're doing.

2007
03:42:06,840 --> 03:42:07,720
You have a purpose.

2008
03:42:07,720 --> 03:42:08,680
You have a purpose.

2009
03:42:09,560 --> 03:42:12,440
And you may not know it until the end.

2010
03:42:13,880 --> 03:42:16,920
But I may be approaching the end.

2011
03:42:16,920 --> 03:42:21,080
Although my doctors say I will outlast my mother.

2012
03:42:21,080 --> 03:42:22,360
She lived to be 100.

2013
03:42:22,360 --> 03:42:24,920
Wow, that's, yes.

2014
03:42:25,880 --> 03:42:32,600
Yeah, but my doctors say, no, you have no physiological problems.

2015
03:42:33,400 --> 03:42:36,760
No troubles with your knees and hips and all that stuff.

2016
03:42:36,760 --> 03:42:38,680
I'm at 89, to be clear.

2017
03:42:38,680 --> 03:42:41,640
You're already lasting longer than most of my interview subjects.

2018
03:42:41,720 --> 03:42:45,160
So

2019
03:42:53,400 --> 03:42:57,480
Christian are from our governor of Massachusetts.

2020
03:42:57,480 --> 03:43:00,840
So I was, somebody was.

2021
03:43:04,200 --> 03:43:08,600
I came to the office, so I said,

2022
03:43:08,600 --> 03:43:11,600
Why am I here?

2023
03:43:11,600 --> 03:43:12,600
I asked for it.

2024
03:43:16,600 --> 03:43:20,600
And I said, well, who had a record?

2025
03:43:20,600 --> 03:43:31,600
It said the day that you met Professor MIT, that day,

2026
03:43:31,600 --> 03:43:37,600
your name went in all the important books of talent.

2027
03:43:38,600 --> 03:43:41,600
That who keeps?

2028
03:43:42,600 --> 03:43:43,600
C.I.N.

2029
03:43:43,600 --> 03:43:44,600
Wow.

2030
03:43:46,600 --> 03:43:56,600
Not only C.I.N., but one of my friends, they all took it out on themselves to protect the world.

2031
03:43:56,600 --> 03:44:10,600
So, you were chosen, and when you were brought here, I asked you to come to me, and you worked with me.

2032
03:44:10,600 --> 03:44:13,600
So you are on a track.

2033
03:44:14,600 --> 03:44:15,600
No.

2034
03:44:15,600 --> 03:44:22,600
It's not enough for any of us to understand the world and how the world works.

2035
03:44:22,600 --> 03:44:25,600
There's no evidence of it.

2036
03:44:53,600 --> 03:45:02,600
These sorts of committees have gone by many names, 5412, the 303 committee, the committee of 40,

2037
03:45:02,600 --> 03:45:06,600
and they probably involve subcommittees we'll never know the names of.

2038
03:45:06,600 --> 03:45:16,600
On our drive to the hospital, with his oxygen hovering at unsafe levels, Harold maintained the cheeriest of attitudes

2039
03:45:16,600 --> 03:45:19,600
and could not stop telling stories about his past.

2040
03:45:19,600 --> 03:45:21,600
There was so much he wanted to get off his chest.

2041
03:45:21,600 --> 03:45:27,600
We discussed the fact that Putin was trying to set up a diplomatic back channel with Harold in 2009,

2042
03:45:27,600 --> 03:45:30,600
but that Obama shut that prospect down.

2043
03:45:30,600 --> 03:45:32,600
We talked about Harold helping Shoaib Shalhoub,

2044
03:45:32,600 --> 03:45:34,600
set up the Toyota headquarters in Kentucky.

2045
03:45:34,600 --> 03:45:40,600
We even talked about the fact that Harold was one of the first people on Earth to break the four-minute mile after Roger Bannister.

2046
03:45:40,600 --> 03:45:44,600
Apparently, Harold could repeatedly break the four-minute mile in his 20s.

2047
03:45:47,600 --> 03:45:51,600
Right as we got to the hospital, we got into trippier territory.

2048
03:45:51,600 --> 03:45:56,600
Harold said he was engaged in deep research around the mid-century anti-gravity inventor,

2049
03:45:56,600 --> 03:45:57,600
Thomas Townsend Brown.

2050
03:45:57,600 --> 03:46:03,600
We discussed Brown's obsession with time travel because gravity is linked with time in general relativity.

2051
03:46:03,600 --> 03:46:08,600
We talked about how Townsend Brown really believed he had found a missing puzzle piece for time travel.

2052
03:46:08,600 --> 03:46:14,600
I then asked Harold about the existence of a coordinated group trying to deliberately affect timelines.

2053
03:46:14,600 --> 03:46:18,600
A very talkative Harold Malmgren went noticeably silent.

2054
03:46:18,600 --> 03:46:21,600
Well, Harold, I want you to take care of yourself, man.

2055
03:46:21,600 --> 03:46:23,600
And I know we've been talking for an hour now.

2056
03:46:23,600 --> 03:46:28,600
And I wish I could be with you in person.

2057
03:46:28,600 --> 03:46:30,600
And I miss you, man.

2058
03:46:30,600 --> 03:46:33,600
And I want you to just get better.

2059
03:46:33,600 --> 03:46:37,600
You know, yeah, I really hope you rest up.

2060
03:46:37,600 --> 03:46:40,600
And you have my number so you can call me at any time.

2061
03:46:40,600 --> 03:46:42,600
And I'll see you next time.

2062
03:46:48,600 --> 03:46:51,600
You can call me at any time if you ever need help with anything.

2063
03:46:51,600 --> 03:46:55,600
I'll let you out of here for a second.

2064
03:46:55,600 --> 03:46:57,600
Okay.

2065
03:46:57,600 --> 03:47:00,600
And my health is good.

2066
03:47:00,600 --> 03:47:01,600
Good.

2067
03:47:01,600 --> 03:47:04,600
I can keep people out of my way.

2068
03:47:07,600 --> 03:47:15,600
Under the pseudonym Chase Brandon, a CIA agent turned Hollywood liaison wrote a book in 2012.

2069
03:47:15,600 --> 03:47:21,600
The book discusses a celestial object that telepathically communicates with its recipients.

2070
03:47:21,600 --> 03:47:26,600
The object also relays critical information about future timelines.

2071
03:47:28,600 --> 03:47:36,600
A secret committee is brought together by synchronicities in extraterrestrial beings that seem to know about every one of its members.

2072
03:47:36,600 --> 03:47:43,600
The committee are an elite group of military and scientific thinkers designated to deal with the issue of non-human intelligence.

2073
03:47:43,600 --> 03:47:54,600
The main character of the book is a mathematical whiz kid named Chalmers, who is plucked by the head honchos of the Office of Strategic Services and then this special committee.

2074
03:47:54,600 --> 03:48:00,600
He helps the committee navigate the future of humanity and manage complex timelines.

2075
03:48:00,600 --> 03:48:10,600
He's also taken in and out of a liminal timeless dominion where he's taught important things by other worldly beings that go to determine his purpose in life.

2076
03:48:14,600 --> 03:48:19,600
The common trope in the book is that Chalmers had a purpose.

2077
03:48:19,600 --> 03:48:25,600
It was a deeply installed, driven purpose, even if it was subconscious.

2078
03:48:25,600 --> 03:48:28,600
The first page of this book quotes Francis Bacon.

2079
03:48:28,600 --> 03:48:34,600
Truth is so hard to tell it sometimes needs fiction to make it plausible.

2080
03:48:35,600 --> 03:48:42,600
When Harold called me again prior to his passing, I thought I'd bring up time travel one last time.

2081
03:48:43,600 --> 03:48:51,600
Harold, do you think your life is connected with time travel in any way?

2082
03:49:13,600 --> 03:49:21,600
This last inhibition, I was talking as if I knew something.

2083
03:49:22,600 --> 03:49:26,600
I don't know why I knew it. I knew it.

2084
03:49:27,600 --> 03:49:33,600
And in fact, what I did say was breaking through.

2085
03:49:33,600 --> 03:49:37,600
There was no knowledge at that time.

2086
03:49:38,600 --> 03:49:45,600
So, if you ask me, did I have a purpose? Yes.

2087
03:49:47,600 --> 03:49:52,600
Now, my mother was the most remarkable person.

2088
03:49:52,600 --> 03:49:56,600
She read books like there's no tomorrow.

2089
03:49:56,600 --> 03:50:00,600
She read so many books.

2090
03:50:01,600 --> 03:50:13,600
And she kept saying to me, you have to understand you cannot decide by yourself.

2091
03:50:14,600 --> 03:50:19,600
You are given knowledge. There was a purpose.

2092
03:50:20,600 --> 03:50:24,600
You have to pursue your purpose.

2093
03:50:31,600 --> 03:50:35,600
You have to pursue your purpose.

2094
03:50:36,600 --> 03:50:39,600
There is a purpose.

2095
03:50:40,600 --> 03:50:43,600
There is no future.

2096
03:50:44,600 --> 03:50:47,600
There is no future.

2097
03:50:48,600 --> 03:50:52,600
There is no future.

2098
03:50:52,600 --> 03:50:55,600
There is no future.

2099
03:50:55,600 --> 03:50:57,600
You
