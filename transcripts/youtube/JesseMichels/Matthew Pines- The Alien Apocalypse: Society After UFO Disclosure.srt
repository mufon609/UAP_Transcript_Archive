1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Fringe opinions on Bitcoin and UAPs four or five years ago

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,280
are now increasingly normy.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,000
The reality of non-human intelligence

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,400
was fully out there.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,240
Yeah, it was so weird.

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,040
Now it's coming in, and now you got psionics.

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,920
It's like, oof, well, that's the new thing out there.

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,520
But that's probably also coming in.

9
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,600
Consciousness and light beings and meditative practices.

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,440
It's like we're rediscovering a lot of ancient knowledge.

11
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,960
It's just being reinterpreted through our modern frame.

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,200
What sort of disclosure are we gonna get?

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,720
And also, what is the curve that you think

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,920
is behind these data points?

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,360
Is it the non-human intelligences, alien civilizations,

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,280
and some advanced spacecraft coming here

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,800
to monitor us curve?

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,280
Is it time travelers?

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,520
Is it crypto-terrestrials?

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,920
Is it inter-dimensionals?

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,520
It does feel like this sort of Pandora's box.

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,520
You have hope, but then there's a whole lot of bad stuff

23
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,480
that comes with it.

24
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,760
Not all knowledge is just, oh, this is a rainbow.

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,560
Oh, this is forever knowledge.

26
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,360
There's no guarantee that the box of knowledge

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,720
humanity's dipping its hand into

28
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,720
is gonna be like good knowledge.

29
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,640
Bitcoin and UAPs and AI, these are fully at the center

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,440
of what's gonna drive major strategic dynamics

31
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,520
over the next few years.

32
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,520
["Different Parts of the Brain"]

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,960
Different parts of the brain have different activities.

34
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,240
But you know that, don't you?

35
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,240
["Different Parts of the Brain"]

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,680
New people that you rule out.

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,360
Maybe you should interview me.

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,360
["Different Parts of the Brain"]

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,160
I'm here with Matthew Pines,

40
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,600
who is the executive director at Bitcoin Policy Institute.

41
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,760
I think if I were to handcraft a podcast guest,

42
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,400
you would be it.

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,960
You just are always such a deep wellspring of knowledge

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,840
across many, many domains.

45
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,080
And so I'm very, very excited to have you here

46
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,000
as things get very weird in 2025.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,840
Yes, sir.

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,240
Thanks for having me.

49
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,080
Absolutely.

50
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,040
I mean, there are a million ways or places to start.

51
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,840
Maybe the one thing I was sort of kicking myself

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,760
for not talking to you about after our last podcast

53
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,800
was Bitcoin, and now you're at the Bitcoin Policy Institute.

54
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,760
So where do you think we go from here?

55
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,600
There are chatters of a strategic reserve.

56
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,000
Obviously, Trump has made promises on this front.

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,960
He was in Nashville at the Bitcoin Conference

58
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,280
earlier this or last year, rather.

59
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,440
And yeah, where do we go from here?

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,040
I guess I'll step back and maybe to bridge

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,880
maybe most of your audience, right,

62
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,640
from the UAP community to the Bitcoin side of things.

63
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,520
And it's something like ironic

64
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,520
and maybe not so ironic similarities

65
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,800
between the evolution of Bitcoin

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,960
as like a sociological phenomenon

67
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,200
and how it sort of played a role in our politics

68
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,120
and the zeitgeist as a symptom of maybe

69
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,440
what are these other dynamics taking place in our society.

70
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,800
And then the similar sort of evolution of UAPs.

71
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,160
They were both on the sort of fringes

72
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,240
of what's considered acceptable,

73
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,560
considered taboo in their respective domains.

74
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,320
Like if you're a financial advisor,

75
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,760
five, six years ago, it was just anathema

76
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,160
to even talk about Bitcoin

77
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,680
as a serious investment opportunity, right?

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,800
And the folks that were attracted to it

79
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
would tend to be sort of heterodox thinkers,

80
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
folks that didn't necessarily trust

81
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,920
in institutional authority,

82
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,560
had a much higher risk tolerance

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,240
or had a much higher degree of confidence

84
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,320
in a particular vision of the future, right?

85
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,720
And so the Bitcoin culture that got started

86
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,160
has this sort of phenomenology

87
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,920
is almost of like a cult religion, right?

88
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,200
It's got this sort of founding figure

89
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,160
that sort of gifts this protocol to the true believers

90
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,320
who have sort of formed this astrological vision

91
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,160
around it, right?

92
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,280
Sort of hyper Bitcoinization.

93
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,360
They were sort of an outgroup.

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
They were kind of not the normal sort of folks

95
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,040
that went through a traditional

96
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,400
sort of meritocratic professional track.

97
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,720
For whatever reason in their background,

98
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,440
they were attracted to this idea

99
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,120
of sort of an open monetary network.

100
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,240
And so they sort of went in

101
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,440
and it formed this sort of unique culture

102
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,360
and it has Bitcoin podcasts,

103
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,640
it has Bitcoin conferences and influencers.

104
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,760
And as social media has developed,

105
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,800
Bitcoin has become this own community, right?

106
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,200
And then as Bitcoin became more and more

107
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,600
of an adopted asset as the network grew,

108
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,760
it obviously grew in total market value.

109
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,640
And then it became much more of a political force.

110
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,440
And then politicians started to get engaged

111
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,760
and it started to be like a regulatory conversation

112
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,680
that was triggered around Bitcoin

113
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,240
and the broader digital asset space.

114
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,240
And so the Bitcoin concept sort of went from total fringe,

115
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,120
heterodox, somewhat taboo topic,

116
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,000
and it's sort of been on this trajectory towards

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,400
inside the Overton window.

118
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,360
And now you have essentially President of the United States

119
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,800
saying he wants America to be the crypto capital world, right?

120
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,840
So that is a kind of remarkable evolution

121
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,080
for something to go through

122
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,120
in a relatively short period of time.

123
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,040
And I think that there's some interesting parallels

124
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,920
to that kind of trajectory for Bitcoin and the UAP topic,

125
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,760
right?

126
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,160
I think whatever underlying reasons

127
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,600
for that similarity we can explore,

128
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,760
but just as a first level set of observations,

129
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,960
similar sort of fringe, somewhat taboo subject,

130
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,360
people are attracted to it via some idiosyncratic mix

131
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,680
of their personal experience and their professional

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,400
or psychological sort of focuses.

133
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,080
And it has its own insular sort of canonical lore

134
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,280
and influencers and podcasts and conferences.

135
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,560
And it has also undergone this evolution, right?

136
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,960
From since 2017, where it was completely somewhat fringe

137
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,760
and kind of this outgroup culture,

138
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,680
and then had gone through this period of,

139
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,440
gradual semi-official legitimization, right?

140
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,880
So starting with the New York Times articles

141
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,200
and then progressive engagement,

142
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,800
correlated to direct sort of legislative engagement

143
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,640
and acknowledgement as well.

144
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,480
And it just so happens,

145
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,120
like one of the course sort of senators involved in

146
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,080
on the pro crypto legislation, Senator Gillibrand,

147
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,160
is also the same Senator who's been involved

148
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,080
in some of the initial sort of UAP legislation.

149
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,840
The Gillibrand-Lumis bill on the crypto side

150
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,000
and the Gillibrand-Rubio amendments on the other side.

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,640
And they happened around the same sort of time period.

152
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,080
And now we're at this particular moment in time, right?

153
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,160
And heading into the first few weeks

154
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,120
of the Trump administration,

155
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,160
where both Bitcoin as a policy issue

156
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,560
is pretty highly salient in a topic of contention and focus

157
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,400
at the senior and most levels of the administration.

158
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,480
At the same time, UAPs are also like increasingly

159
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,600
of such subject of White House level, cabinet level,

160
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,200
like discourse and speculation, right?

161
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,920
The speculation Bitcoin community is like,

162
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,760
how serious and how pro Bitcoin

163
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,040
is the White House really gonna be?

164
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,520
Who's really gonna,

165
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,400
what sort of executive orders are gonna be passed?

166
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,240
What sorts of pro Bitcoin policies

167
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,120
are gonna be put forward?

168
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
The same sorts of questions are happening on the UAP side.

169
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,520
How serious is the administration about disclosure?

170
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,600
What sort of pro UAP cabinet secretaries

171
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,480
are gonna be confirmed and how forceful

172
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,680
are they gonna be in executing

173
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,480
on that pro UAP policy position?

174
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,760
Very similar, right?

175
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,520
We've got potentially pro Bitcoin cabinet secretaries

176
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,360
and the question is like,

177
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,920
how pro Bitcoin are they really gonna be?

178
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,200
And in many ways, often they're the same people, right?

179
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,120
Like you have Tulsi Gabbard at DNI,

180
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,600
who's apparently pretty pro Bitcoin

181
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,760
and also now I think her testimony

182
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,440
was talking about sort of UAPs explicitly

183
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,280
in her opening statement.

184
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,640
Do you think she'll get confirmed?

185
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,480
I don't know.

186
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,160
I'm not an expert in handicapping the Senate.

187
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,320
I don't know, 50-50.

188
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,880
I mean, it'll probably be decided

189
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,400
but by the time this is aired,

190
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
so whatever prediction I make will look.

191
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,120
I think she's like slightly above 50%

192
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,840
in polymarket or whatever, so.

193
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,280
Yeah, and I think I haven't seen most of her full testimony

194
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,440
or what the reactions were,

195
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,080
so I can't necessarily judge

196
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,200
because it depends on how the senators

197
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,480
perceived her testimony and what the media reaction is.

198
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,680
But yeah, but just stepping back,

199
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,080
so I just find a remarkable sort of fact

200
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,960
about our political economy

201
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,880
and our sort of the sociological process underway

202
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,520
that these two sort of outgroup somewhat fringe topics,

203
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,880
UAPs and Bitcoin,

204
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
also just my personal preoccupation

205
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,320
for the past five, six years,

206
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,800
like thinking intellectually about these things

207
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,160
in a very serious way.

208
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,640
But, you know, and for me professionally,

209
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,800
these things started out on like the side,

210
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,400
just things I was interested in.

211
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,520
I just happened to be really sort of obsessed

212
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,640
with these two topics,

213
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,080
like not for any particular reason

214
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,120
or like why they were related to each other,

215
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,280
just that's sort of how my intellectual interests

216
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,720
sort of evolved.

217
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,880
And then they both kind of been embarking on this process,

218
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,760
you know, the last four or five years,

219
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,800
kind of coming into the Overton window

220
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,960
and now becoming subject of very serious sort of policy

221
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,760
deliberation and decision now

222
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,480
at the highest level of the U.S. government.

223
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,960
And so that's just like the way I would start.

224
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,200
It's just like these are,

225
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,960
you seem like these are disconnected phenomena.

226
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,520
There must be some underlying reason.

227
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,840
I don't know if we could dig into speculation

228
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,600
about why these two things are all happening at once.

229
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,640
At the same time, you also have AI,

230
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,400
I think also undergoing the similar evolution

231
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,240
you look at, right?

232
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,560
The blog posts about artificial super intelligence,

233
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
these sort of less wrong, hyper rationalist,

234
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,760
effective altruist movement was they're kind of fringe

235
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,520
in group, you know, internet conversations.

236
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,000
They had their own canonical debates and war

237
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,240
and, you know, little internecine, you know,

238
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
factions, et cetera.

239
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,080
Same thing with Bitcoin.

240
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,760
You had sort of factions split off about the, you know,

241
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,320
the core vision about what Bitcoin is.

242
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,200
You have factions in the UAP community, right?

243
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,040
All these sorts of things develop these same dynamics.

244
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,960
And then the AI question has gone from those blog posts

245
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,960
to now, like, again, strategic level conversation,

246
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,640
stock market swings 10% in a day

247
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,600
because one Chinese lab, you know,

248
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,720
releases an AI model, right?

249
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,040
This is where we are now.

250
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,520
And I think Bitcoin and UAPs and AI,

251
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,360
like these are now fully at the center

252
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,880
of what's gonna drive major strategic dynamics

253
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,720
over the next few years.

254
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,200
So it's one of those things where if you

255
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,280
wanna try to read the future,

256
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,680
and I have been obsessed with trying to understand

257
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,880
what's really going on and what's likely to happen

258
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,080
in the future.

259
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
And you kind of have to pay attention to these things

260
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,240
coming in from the tails.

261
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,040
These like little bubbles of phenomenon,

262
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,120
whether it's this idea of AI,

263
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
this prospect of Bitcoin monetizing,

264
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,040
the prospect that UAPs are not a total fiction.

265
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,800
It's like the what if AI turns out to be a real thing.

266
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,360
What if Bitcoin monetizes significantly?

267
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,640
What if UAPs are real?

268
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,520
Like each of those things individually

269
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,200
has massive strategic implications

270
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,800
and they all happen to be, you know,

271
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,520
leaning towards the yes, right,

272
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,480
of that what if at the same time.

273
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,520
And that's what I think is a strategic change

274
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,440
that a lot of people that are maybe embedded

275
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,720
in a set of mental models that they anchored

276
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,440
five, 10, 15 years ago,

277
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,720
are just not well positioned to keep track of

278
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,640
and then to anticipate the changes that might be coming

279
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,480
in the next few years.

280
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,400
Yeah, it's almost like it's the total energy

281
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,240
of the system equals potential energy plus kinetic energy.

282
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,920
All of those things have huge potential energy buildups.

283
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,040
And it's just, yeah, it's unclear how exactly it pans out

284
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,360
or, you know, not to mix physics analogies,

285
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,760
but how the wave function collapses or whatever.

286
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,680
But there's sort of, you know,

287
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,880
a lot of possibilities with these things.

288
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,520
And it's almost like, you know,

289
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,160
the history of the last 50 or so years

290
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,880
has been the history of successive bubbles.

291
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,720
And like in the 70s, you could say,

292
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,400
like real growth really started to slow.

293
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,680
80s and 90s was kind of like, you know,

294
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,320
financial deregulation bubble.

295
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,120
Early 2000s, you had the real estate bubble,

296
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,440
globalization bubble or whatever with NAFTA,

297
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,200
maybe in between those two.

298
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,560
And then in 08 was this big watershed moment.

299
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,400
And then 09, Bitcoin, you know,

300
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,680
read Satoshi's white paper and it's this like,

301
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,600
they're sort of gambling with our sovereignty.

302
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,560
Satoshi seems like this very kind of,

303
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,440
anti-Wall Street, anti-big finance,

304
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,200
when you had Occupy Wall Street at that time as well.

305
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,120
And so this is a weird way to put it,

306
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,760
but it's almost like the last bubble

307
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,600
is always the money bubble.

308
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,960
And so like Bitcoin is an arbitrage

309
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,360
against the money bubble.

310
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,720
And maybe the real last bubble is like the reality bubble.

311
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,240
And like UFOs are somehow like, you know,

312
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,920
like that's bursting and that's why UFOs are just,

313
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,120
you know, they're not, you know, some deeper ontology,

314
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,200
but they're like the first thing to like peak its head out,

315
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,160
you know, once the reality bubble starts to sort of dissolve.

316
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah, I mean, it's fascinating.

317
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,640
I guess my first sort of hot take reaction to that

318
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,360
is thinking about, again, money is just a concept

319
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,960
and it's an embedded concept

320
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,960
that's reified in human institutions at a certain scale.

321
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,840
Right, we have money like things

322
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,680
at all scales of human institutions,

323
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,760
like social organizations.

324
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,480
Like if you don't have human institutions,

325
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,800
you don't have money, you just have, you know,

326
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,760
people living, you know, hand to mouth

327
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,040
and scraping out subsistence existence.

328
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,640
So as soon as you get to some basic level

329
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,760
of human social organization,

330
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,200
you get something like moneyness as an institutional concept

331
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,960
that gets instantiated and reified

332
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,240
in different, you know, technologies, right?

333
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,880
The technologies that can instantiate that concept of money,

334
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,880
whether it's seashells or yap stones or gold certificates,

335
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,000
you know, ledger balances at international institutions,

336
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,120
like, you know, everything from special drawing rights

337
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,000
at the IMF to then Bitcoin, which is a sort of, again,

338
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
like a instantiation of this, you know,

339
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,200
but taking advantage of the ambient technologies

340
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,320
that are now available to a digital society.

341
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,960
And so this is just the process of evolution

342
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,760
of human societies adapting different, you know,

343
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,520
basic sociological sort of primitives,

344
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,440
but now the possibility space of what they can do

345
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,200
expands as their technological capabilities change.

346
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,440
So now you can realistically maintain something

347
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,560
like a consensus distributed ledger around the world, right?

348
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,280
It wasn't possible until you had the basic technologies

349
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,280
of the internet and public private key, you know, cryptography.

350
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,040
And so this is where the basic primitives

351
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,960
that Satoshi put together and he published

352
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,000
into the sort of the, you know, 2009 as an open source.

353
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,080
And that's a bit, we should drive this home

354
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,200
because whenever I speak to kind of boomer financial people

355
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,560
or whatever, they act like that's not a big deal.

356
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,360
Like, what is it, the Byzantine general problem or whatever,

357
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,480
like the double spending thing, that's not a big deal.

358
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
It's a huge deal.

359
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Like the idea that you can create digital scarcity.

360
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,360
And then, you know, there are all sorts of possible derivatives

361
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,440
from the digital scarcity,

362
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,520
but just the digital scarcity itself,

363
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,400
which Bitcoin is the kind of archetypal example of,

364
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,200
is sort of really important

365
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,480
because software doesn't usually operate like that.

366
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,080
And so that's like really interesting.

367
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,400
It's like it was the first real computer science breakthrough

368
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,320
that became a meme, right?

369
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,480
And so people have hard time trying to reconcile

370
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,280
both the mimetic aspects of Bitcoin

371
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,400
and the hard technical scientific breakthrough

372
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,800
that it embodied, right?

373
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,760
Well, they also have trouble swallowing the fact

374
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,520
that like our other financial institutions

375
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
are at all mimetic themselves

376
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,000
and that you upend the old mimesis with some new mimesis.

377
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,080
Well, this is where we get,

378
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,920
often you get into these interesting debates

379
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,320
that turn into philosophical questions of like,

380
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,160
what are human institutions?

381
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,280
What are these human concepts?

382
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,800
Like how real is the state as a concept?

383
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,840
How real is the promise of a state

384
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,960
to pay back its debts a thing,

385
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,120
which is essentially what money is in our system.

386
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,280
And it's like, these are socio-technical systems,

387
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,160
not so you get to like jargony,

388
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,880
but like in a sense, all money is an interface

389
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,800
between human belief and the physical world, right?

390
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,440
Which is what intermediates the actions

391
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,640
that human beings take as a result of their beliefs.

392
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,160
And so that's just what humans are.

393
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,360
It's what we do.

394
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,560
There's been philosophical debates

395
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,520
about how much reality you assign

396
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,560
to like these different concepts, like money.

397
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,400
Is it a thing?

398
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Is it just a social fiction?

399
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,280
If it's all just a matter of mutual belief,

400
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,840
then can we all just decide to believe something different?

401
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,160
But again, it's interface between human belief and reality.

402
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,960
You can't just believe anything, right?

403
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,920
Reality imposes, you know, exogenous constraints

404
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,960
on what that belief can do in the world.

405
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Doesn't it all just kind of come down to,

406
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,400
you know, who has a monopoly on sacred violence?

407
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,840
Who can perform sacred violence?

408
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,240
And the government is that at the limit.

409
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,440
And so, you know, it's like,

410
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,560
it all ultimately is like sort of taxation

411
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,800
is like a version of that.

412
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,880
If you don't pay your taxes,

413
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,640
you end up in jail or something.

414
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,880
The Max Weber kind of deconstruction view of the state.

415
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,960
I mean, that's getting deep into political philosophy.

416
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,800
I don't think it's interesting

417
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,120
to have like a particular strong view of like,

418
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,240
you know, the build up this tower of institutions

419
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,720
that anchor these webs of mutual fictions

420
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,560
that we call, you know, these collective beliefs.

421
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,800
The state, the constitution, the social contract.

422
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,400
These are all higher level kind of shared fictions

423
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,800
that we all agree in as a sense of mutual consensus belief

424
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,040
that we will continue to keep believing them, right?

425
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,080
States break down when that embedded assumption

426
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,920
that everyone will continue

427
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,000
to basically believe the same thing tomorrow

428
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,720
about those, you know, shared fictions breaks down, right?

429
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,360
When you don't actually trust,

430
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,680
that's what trust essentially is at scale, right?

431
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,200
Can Bitcoin serve as a head?

432
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,920
Because I think about the last like five years

433
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,520
and this idea of like modern monetary theory,

434
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,320
like as long as your debt is denominated

435
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,160
in your own currency, you can sort of like print it away.

436
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,080
And like, once we start to talk in those terms,

437
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
it feels like that's sort of the beginning

438
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,680
of the end or something.

439
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,360
Like that doesn't feel good.

440
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,480
And so is Bitcoin like, is it, you know,

441
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,160
this fully decentralized thing or, you know,

442
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,640
presumably Trump wouldn't get behind it if it was.

443
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,520
And is it actually like a hedge, you know,

444
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,640
as far as like ensuring, you know, solvency

445
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,960
from the United States perspective on a go-forward basis?

446
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,040
Well, again, those are trillion dollar sort of questions.

447
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,240
I don't have a, you know, high confident answer

448
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,560
to how it's really gonna shake out.

449
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,280
But I think it's important to think about Bitcoin

450
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,920
as an emerging institution, right?

451
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,960
That is a novel type of institution

452
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,760
that we haven't really seen before, right?

453
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,560
It's a global decentralized, open,

454
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,920
meaning there's no gatekeeper to access, you know,

455
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,760
your ability to transact or hold it.

456
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
It doesn't require a third party

457
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,640
to sort of validate your transactions

458
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,840
to secure your rights in the network.

459
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,960
You can essentially do that with essentially math

460
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,000
and open source software.

461
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,760
So this is a kind of novel technology

462
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,880
that can form as a predicate for an emerging institution

463
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,760
that started off fully peer-to-peer,

464
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,240
again, kind of crypto anarchist, internet forums,

465
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,880
dark web markets, you know,

466
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
Ford thinking investors, et cetera,

467
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,120
and is now engaging at the level of nation states.

468
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,080
And so we're seeing this, you know, quite dramatic.

469
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,600
And for me, just fascinating interplay

470
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,160
between these existing state institutional structures

471
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,000
and super state institutional structures,

472
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,680
say like the ECB or the Bank of International Settlements

473
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,360
and the sort of international norms between central banks

474
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,320
as well as major pools of international capital,

475
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,840
which are, you know, these are institutions themselves, right?

476
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,160
And they formed as a result of decades of sort of evolution,

477
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,600
right, within a certain global context,

478
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,000
especially in the post-war era,

479
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,760
especially in say the post 1990s,

480
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,080
kind of neoliberal sort of capitalist,

481
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,480
sort of US sort of dominated global system.

482
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,400
And then in comes Bitcoin as this kind of thing

483
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,600
from left field that is now, you know,

484
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,240
as again, it's sort of emerging into first order

485
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
just as an asset that like those existing institutions

486
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,400
can buy, right?

487
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,240
So BlackRock has their ETF and they're now pitching it

488
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,440
to their clients and saying to sovereign wealth funds,

489
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,960
it's prudent for any institution

490
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,840
to hold between two and 5%, right?

491
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,920
So they just view it as it's an asset, you can hold it,

492
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,760
it provides diversification benefits

493
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,240
because it's volatility, it's, you know,

494
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,400
correlation is ads overall kind of say,

495
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
like improves the sharp ratio of the median portfolio.

496
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,360
So they're thinking that from a purely investment asset,

497
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,960
it's like as a novel asset,

498
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,880
it's now gone through this hyper speculative phase,

499
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,000
it's now in its institutionalization phase,

500
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,520
and therefore it's a safe thing

501
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,600
to sort of prudently diversify into

502
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,760
as part of a portfolio sort of allocation decision.

503
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,080
But that belies like what's really happening

504
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,920
underneath the surface,

505
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,880
which is, okay, you have this weird,

506
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,120
it's not just an asset, it's this network,

507
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,040
and it's a network that no one really controls, right?

508
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,560
That's the secret, right?

509
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,640
There really isn't some,

510
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,280
you can't just go to the Bitcoin CEO

511
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,000
and get them in a room and say like,

512
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,120
do something different, right?

513
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,400
It's like there's nobody to bring in,

514
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,600
there's no throat to choke, right?

515
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,840
You can get the head of Coinbase,

516
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,280
you can get the head of BlackRock,

517
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,200
you can get the head of, you know, any company,

518
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,040
and you can bring them into a room and be like,

519
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,560
we want you to do something different.

520
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,280
There's literally nobody to go to.

521
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,800
Is the one sort of devil's advocate argument there

522
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,840
is like the identity of Satoshi?

523
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,280
But even there, it's like,

524
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,840
he can't do anything to change the network.

525
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
I mean, he has a certain cult of personality.

526
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,920
So you think it's a he.

527
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,800
I mean, I think people recognize it in his correspondence

528
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,280
as most likely male.

529
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,120
I think that's pretty accepted.

530
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,640
Do you have any theories?

531
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,800
Oh man, the whole, so who is Satoshi question to me

532
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,200
is kind of banal, but I don't, I mean,

533
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,320
I find it fascinating.

534
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,720
I mean, it is fascinating, again, as a historical question.

535
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,640
I think though it's really, you know,

536
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,880
I think he's dead, to be honest, whoever it is.

537
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,120
That's best for people who are pro-Bitcoin to say.

538
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,160
I mean, it's interesting.

539
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,920
You can go back to like the early history of Bitcoin.

540
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,400
Like Bitcoin didn't come out of nowhere, right?

541
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,200
In fact, Satoshi even cites, you know,

542
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,880
like David Chaum and Wei Dai.

543
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,320
Nick Szabo.

544
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Nick Szabo.

545
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,520
And so, you know, he was taking different pieces

546
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,120
that had already been put in place

547
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,840
and trying to stitch together this, you know,

548
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,240
it solved this unique problem, right?

549
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,400
The double span problem.

550
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,640
And took the proof of work sort of concept as well.

551
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,680
And so added in difficulty adjustments.

552
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,720
So it was this kind of melange of things

553
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,480
that no one had to put together in just the right way.

554
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,880
And yeah, I mean, the most relevant,

555
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,680
there's like two main things that would be relevant

556
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,040
if Satoshi was still alive and could like intervene

557
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,880
sort of Deus ex machina, right?

558
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,080
Into the present day context.

559
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,800
Like one is just his actual holdings are enormous, right?

560
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,640
Enormous.

561
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,840
A million bitcoins.

562
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,240
So just his decision to move coins or spend coins

563
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,560
would have a massive market impact, right?

564
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,600
And then the question is if he would try to insert himself

565
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,840
in Bitcoin development conversations,

566
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,160
he would obviously immediately become, you know,

567
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,000
like first among equals, right?

568
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,320
If not the dominant force in terms of debating

569
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,200
on any future changes to the protocol.

570
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,640
And that would turn Bitcoin's development ecosystem

571
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,520
potentially more like how Ethereum has evolved.

572
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,000
We still have Vitalik,

573
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,080
who's the charismatic singular founder personality

574
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,800
who's very active and makes his opinions known.

575
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,760
And the rest of the community defers to his opinions.

576
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,800
In fact, there was this recent shakeup, right?

577
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,280
With the Ethereum foundation and it kind of, you know,

578
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,440
acrimony between developers and debates about

579
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,800
this very complicated development roadmap

580
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,920
that they've laid out.

581
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,840
And that would introduce new risk, right?

582
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,240
Like the basic risk profile of Bitcoin

583
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,680
as an open source sort of software project, essentially,

584
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,840
that operates on this sort of rough consensus mechanism

585
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,640
is it's very hard to change.

586
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,720
It's very resistant to change.

587
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,600
It takes enormous amounts of time and broad consensus

588
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,360
to make even relatively trivial changes to the protocol

589
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,040
because it's functioning essentially as digital gold, right?

590
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,880
It just doesn't change.

591
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,960
And so that's, you know, this debate

592
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,960
that actually is really interesting within Bitcoin

593
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,840
is this sort of ossification debate, right?

594
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,560
There are some folks that think Bitcoin

595
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,840
should really just never change, like at all.

596
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,200
Literally no tweaks.

597
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,040
Like anything you change is a risk.

598
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,880
And then some people would think,

599
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,000
well, there are some long-term things

600
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,200
about the nature of the protocol,

601
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,720
these like little additional features

602
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,320
that would really unlock a whole bunch of additional

603
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,960
capability for say, time-lock sort of, you know,

604
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,800
sort of very constrained smart contracts, right?

605
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,920
Ethereum is kind of a more turn complete language.

606
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,400
And so there's some issues with that,

607
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,520
but it gives a much more open expressivity

608
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,400
to what you can do on the blockchain.

609
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,200
Whereas Bitcoin is very much a very discreet.

610
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,920
If it's trying to be a gold analog,

611
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,240
I don't know if you need to do much more than, you know,

612
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,520
what you've already done.

613
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,160
I mean, there are a few design,

614
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,280
I mean, the design was pretty, pretty perfect,

615
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,400
but like there are some flaws you could point at,

616
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,720
like the, you know, I don't think he anticipated

617
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,960
ASICs chips, for example, or like, you know,

618
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,040
like extreme concentration in the chain itself, you know?

619
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,080
I mean, it's held up well.

620
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,920
I mean, from when he was mining on a laptop

621
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,360
to when now you have like, you know,

622
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,000
massively capable special purpose, you know,

623
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,640
integrated circuits that have been designed

624
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,000
just to run the algorithm.

625
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,640
And the difficulty adjustment is the true genius, right?

626
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,280
Cause it doesn't matter how much energy you throw at it

627
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,800
in two weeks, it's going to automatically adjust

628
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,240
to take into account any breakthrough

629
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,240
in the hashing technology.

630
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,720
And so that is, but the interesting thing about Satoshi

631
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,760
is that if he was still around and he decided to say,

632
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,520
hey guys, like, I was just chilling out, but now I'm back.

633
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,080
And I've got all these great ideas

634
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,320
about how to improve Bitcoin, right?

635
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,120
That's been the story of Bitcoin for a while now,

636
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,360
especially in those first few years where it was like,

637
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,240
oh, Bitcoin's great, but like, you know, it's too slow.

638
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,160
The block size is too small.

639
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,480
I want to add these additional features

640
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,160
and I'm going to fork it, yada, yada, yada.

641
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,800
And there's always like Roger Verri, all these additional,

642
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,400
the block size wars were all about this.

643
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,840
Bitcoin cash is the true Bitcoin.

644
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,080
And so that was part of the whole risk of Bitcoin

645
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,040
in the very early stages is you didn't know like,

646
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,120
which Bitcoin would win, right?

647
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,320
And so it's been this, you know,

648
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,600
process of historical accretion and consensus over time,

649
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,840
kind of this sort of like a physics process

650
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,560
of kind of sort of condensation,

651
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,840
where it's like you have something that's really hot, right?

652
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
And it's floating between many different states

653
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,040
and it's cooling down, right?

654
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,440
It's like a phase transition

655
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,360
and then it starts to lock in, right?

656
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,480
And we haven't, I would say we haven't fully locked in.

657
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,320
There's like still pockets of, you know,

658
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,320
where the crystal lattice is still somewhat fungible, right?

659
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,160
Maybe there's like, you know,

660
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,080
small little bits that could be added here

661
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,520
to add additional features,

662
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,280
but it's clearly in this process of kind of cooling down,

663
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,560
right?

664
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,400
It's like the big bang, right?

665
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,200
The big bang early on, hyper, you know, plasmas,

666
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,400
and maybe even though like the forces themselves

667
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,040
are like all unified in this big soup

668
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,720
and the boundary constraints of the universe

669
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,680
were pretty wide.

670
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,920
And as it cools down, like, you know,

671
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,960
gravity splits off and then electroweak force.

672
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,080
And then it's like, you get the phase transitions down

673
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,400
and then it, you know, becomes transparent to light,

674
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,360
you know, 300,000 years.

675
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,880
And then boom, you've got basically

676
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,360
most of the degrees of freedom

677
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,040
are now kind of locked in for the universe.

678
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
And then the rest of the story of the universe can play out.

679
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,720
So I feel like Bitcoin is, it's like,

680
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,600
there was the big bang of Bitcoins, like a launch.

681
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,720
And then there was this process of kind of cooling

682
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,520
and condensation that took place.

683
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,600
And, you know, it was uncertain at that point,

684
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,400
exactly, you know, whether the block size wars

685
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,920
would turn out in one direction or the other,

686
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,320
whether Satoshi would really be gone,

687
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,640
whether, you know, any given year,

688
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,680
the probability would go down,

689
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,880
but it was like pretty high early on.

690
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,360
Like, is he gonna unmask himself?

691
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,200
Is he actually gonna just say,

692
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,520
hey, it's got you on the CIA guys or something?

693
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,480
And every year that goes by,

694
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,040
it's like this process of cooling and accretion.

695
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,920
And that has, as that happens,

696
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,000
it sort of, it takes the risk off the table.

697
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,160
And then, you know, as that occurs,

698
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,160
if you take the risk off, then its value goes up.

699
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,720
As its value goes up, its volatility generally will come down

700
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,120
because it doesn't take a whole lot.

701
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,600
It takes marginally less new capital to change the price.

702
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,360
The volatility comes down.

703
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,320
The risk tolerance of the next marginal buyer, right,

704
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,520
is now triggered.

705
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,720
And so then the value goes back up.

706
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,680
And that's basically been the process

707
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,840
we've been going through to the point

708
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,240
where you've got BlackRock now,

709
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,160
essentially, you know, shilling it to their clients, right,

710
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,440
and talk more with funds.

711
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,360
So this is this fascinating process,

712
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,200
but unless you're really paying attention to it closely

713
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,800
along that path, all that you really see it

714
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,520
is like when it hits the media narrative

715
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,080
and its characteristics sort of hype cycles.

716
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,080
So you see it, you know, going through these 2013 bubble,

717
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,240
2017 bubble, right, 2021, 22 bubble, right?

718
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,080
And maybe now we're in another bubble cycle, right?

719
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,160
These are these characteristics that are four-year cycles

720
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,040
that we've seen Bitcoin go through.

721
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,600
So the person who's just observing that kind of passively

722
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,880
through whatever media filters,

723
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,080
there's like an activation function

724
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,360
that it's now Bitcoin pops up on their feed or whatever.

725
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,880
It's like, oh, it's another bubble thing, right?

726
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,600
And it just keeps coming back in order of magnitude bigger.

727
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,040
It's like, you know, some people early on saw this

728
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,640
as like a trend and they picked up on it

729
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,920
and they've been handsomely rewarded for seeing this trend.

730
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,560
Others catch on later,

731
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,480
but like it's clear there's a structural dynamic playing

732
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,200
taking place here, which I think is now like impossible

733
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,440
and really sort of a matter of strategic malpractice

734
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,800
if you ignore it.

735
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,920
Like there are presidents and national leaders

736
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,200
and sheiks and kings having active discussions now

737
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,800
about what should they do about Bitcoin?

738
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,960
Like how should they approach Bitcoin?

739
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,920
Like that is just a fact of our geopolitical

740
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,720
and a monetary state of affairs.

741
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,600
And so you could just be like, oh, that's absurd.

742
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,840
This is another bubble.

743
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,080
Okay, but it's like sort of like the UAP question.

744
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Some people see the trends,

745
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,320
pick up on these data points sort of off the curve

746
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,240
and they're naturally inclined to pay attention to that

747
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,200
and they suspect something is happening

748
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,920
that's not just total noise or a complete fiction.

749
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,840
And so they pay attention to it.

750
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,520
And then new data points come in

751
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,080
and that start to stitch together what seems to be a trend.

752
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,800
And you try to interpret what does that really mean?

753
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,080
Is this a trend going towards disclosure?

754
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,280
Is Bitcoin trend going towards nation state adoption?

755
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,000
But it's, when you're early on

756
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and you only have a few data points,

757
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,720
it's like an absurd extrapolation

758
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,000
to confidently predict an outcome.

759
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,800
But more and more data points

760
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,840
are essentially aligning onto that trend line.

761
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,680
And that's going back to the very start of the conversation.

762
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,000
That's the thing that I've been intellectually

763
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,080
very fascinated about is just paying attention

764
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,600
to those initial data points sort of off the curve,

765
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,040
speculating on what trend that might represent

766
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,720
and then paying ever more and more attention

767
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,040
as more data points start to come in

768
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,880
to confirm the trend.

769
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,040
And it seems like in terms of Bitcoin

770
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,120
going on this sort of global adoption

771
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,680
now becoming a geopolitical asset trend.

772
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,320
And then UAP turning into like, this is a real thing.

773
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,400
And like now we may be facing

774
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,040
a much more salient public discourse

775
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,240
on the reality of UAPs and not even intelligence.

776
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,080
Those are just things.

777
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,400
Do you ever notice that the best gifts in life

778
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,960
are the ones that you don't just receive,

779
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,720
but the ones that fit seamlessly in your day

780
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,800
and make them better?

781
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,480
Whether you're enjoying the latest American alchemy content

782
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,600
on the move or just tuning out the world for a moment,

783
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Raycon's everyday earbuds are the perfect pair.

784
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,480
I've been using mine nonstop,

785
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,480
whether I'm editing, making calls, out for a walk,

786
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,960
they've become my go-to.

787
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,480
The 32-hour battery life means I never have to worry

788
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,320
about scrambling for a charger.

789
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,200
And with multi-point connectivity,

790
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,240
I can switch effortlessly between my laptop and phone,

791
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,280
no more reconnecting every time I change devices.

792
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,720
But here's what really makes them a game changer,

793
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,360
active noise cancellation.

794
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,080
Whether I'm working in a noisy cafe or trying to focus,

795
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,040
these earbuds let me zone in on what matters.

796
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,960
And they do so in a way that's honestly better

797
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,000
than any other earbuds I've used.

798
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,920
I've also been loving these cool protective case covers.

799
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,480
Check out this design.

800
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,240
It compliments the earbuds colors perfectly.

801
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,640
It's cool that Raycon offers different designs

802
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,600
so you're not stuck with something generic.

803
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,200
You can actually pick a look that matches your style.

804
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,980
Not only do these look great,

805
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,480
but the new quick charge feature gives me 90 minutes

806
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,840
of battery in just 10 minutes of charge.

807
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,320
That's huge when I'm in a rush.

808
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,480
And they also support wireless charging,

809
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,840
so I never have to take the case off when charging.

810
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,200
And listen, Raycon gives you premium sound

811
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,440
at half the price of other top brands.

812
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,840
If you haven't tried them yet, now is the time.

813
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,680
So go to buyraycon.com slash Jesse Michaels.

814
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Again, that's buyraycon.com slash Jesse, M-I-C-H-E-L-S,

00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,680
to get up to 20% off site-wide.

816
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,000
That's 20% off everything on Raycon's website.

817
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,840
That's right.

818
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,480
You'll get up to 20% off everything on Raycon's website,

819
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,780
including 20% off of all headphones, too,

820
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,760
when you go to buyraycon.com slash Jesse Michael.

821
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,640
Click the link in the description

822
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,920
or go to buyraycon.com slash Jesse Michaels now.

823
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,240
Well, it's a good segue.

824
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,000
Where do you think that goes?

825
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,920
Today, I am releasing an episode with Jake Barber,

826
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,720
who's this firsthand UFO crash retrieval witness

827
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,120
is probably not even doing him justice.

828
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,180
He's an operator.

829
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,400
But the one that he describes is, well, he describes two.

830
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,520
One is an egg-shaped UFO,

831
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,880
and the other is an eight-gon,

832
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,280
like kind of like not quite an octagon,

833
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,480
but like eight sides on the surface,

834
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,160
and it's sort of this black metallic thing.

835
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,160
What do you think of his testimony?

836
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,720
I thought that was remarkable.

837
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,640
Again, we've been kind of on this ratchet

838
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,700
where every few months something new clicks, right?

839
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,760
And it takes the overall conversation.

840
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,640
Again, people that are paying attention

841
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,040
to every little data point here on this curve.

842
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,480
I think there are some people that were,

843
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,240
again, this is where the debates come in.

844
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,440
What sort of disclosure are we gonna get?

845
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,960
And also, what is the curve that you think

846
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,160
is behind these data points?

847
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,640
Is it the non-human intelligences, alien civilizations,

848
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,520
and some advanced spacecraft coming here

849
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,760
to monitor us curve?

850
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,240
Is it time travelers?

851
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,480
Is it crypto-terrestrials?

852
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,280
Is it inter-dimensionals?

853
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,240
Do you have a leading theory?

854
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,660
I mean, I know you have your Wolfram physics stuff,

855
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,000
but do you have a theory ontologically?

856
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,600
It's because this is really interesting.

857
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,800
What is disclosure?

858
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,700
I think for a lot of people,

859
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,920
it's like we just need high-resolution footage,

860
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,840
and then you see the footage,

861
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,800
and you're like, I don't know what I'm looking at.

862
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
And so it's this thing where it's like,

863
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,680
you don't really want the thing you're asking for.

864
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,200
You want a broader worldview.

865
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,360
You wanna understand the ontology behind the thing.

866
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,680
And I think there are a couple of other details

867
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,800
associated with the Jake story

868
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,240
that are worthy of mentioning.

869
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,840
One is he retrieved this Aegon craft via his helicopter,

870
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,280
and it was hanging by a rope.

871
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,200
And he locked onto it with his consciousness,

872
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,880
and it gave him this interesting feel,

873
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,520
this divine feminine sort of feel,

874
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,320
and it made him emotional.

875
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,600
And then the other thing that he says

876
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,600
is that they use psionic assets in the government

877
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,520
to basically, and we should probably change the wording here.

878
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,580
Maybe whoever's doing this should change the wording,

879
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,800
but summon these UFOs into people's

880
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,440
sort of field of consciousness.

881
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,000
And then presumably these things at some point land,

882
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,880
and material might be used or something.

883
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,040
The whole thing is so strange.

884
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
Yeah, and this is where ironically,

885
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,320
the Bitcoin thing is trivially easy to model by comparison,

886
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,880
because the stipulated phenomenon

887
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,800
that you're trying to model and understand

888
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,200
is just the adoption of this asset,

889
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,720
like essentially a collective belief

890
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,840
that this is a real thing,

891
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,640
that other people will continue to believe it's a real thing,

892
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,120
and that different layers of people and institutions,

893
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,040
sovereign wealth funds,

894
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,120
institution pools of capital,

895
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,120
governments, national leaders, et cetera,

896
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,080
will just continue to basically believe that same thing

897
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,600
over into the future.

898
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,440
So it's not like you don't have to construct

899
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,240
a whole bunch of crazy sort of second and third order

900
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,360
or sort of underlying hypotheses for what's going on.

901
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,840
It's sort of just out there in your face,

902
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,080
and you're just making a prediction

903
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,000
about that continuation of that trend.

904
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,520
With the UAP thing, it's vastly more complicated,

905
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,920
and vastly more fraught.

906
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,920
Because just to that point,

907
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,680
and back to my point about what sorts of,

908
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,360
when you're trying to interpret these different data points,

909
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,480
if you're assuming you don't know the truth,

910
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,360
which is almost everybody here, maybe even everybody,

911
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,400
you don't really know what's going on.

912
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,240
All you see is what people are saying, right?

913
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,000
And you have the assigned degrees of credence

914
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,320
to these different statements

915
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,280
that are coming from apparently credible people,

916
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,520
and I think he's extremely credible.

917
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,200
I think he's got the professional bona fides.

918
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,440
He is who he says he is.

919
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,680
I think he's being entirely truthful

920
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,240
in describing his experiences

921
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,760
as sort of essentially a delivery man

922
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,360
in his crash retrieval program.

923
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,120
And you got, but then you've got to,

924
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,000
but that doesn't answer really the object level question

925
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,240
of what's going on, right?

926
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,280
It just gives you a data point

927
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,800
that you need to stitch together into a comprehensive model

928
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,880
that you need to put together with all these other

929
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,080
sort of highly fraught

930
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,480
and inherently uncertain pieces of information.

931
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,720
And so this is where,

932
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,720
this is what gets extremely difficult for almost everybody

933
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,640
to construct such a model,

934
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,720
because you have these two main questions here,

935
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,120
which are the most foundational questions

936
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,200
of human existence, which is like,

937
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,040
are we alone?

938
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,800
And like, what is consciousness, right?

939
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,560
Like separately, enormous, like unknown questions

940
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,880
that are like almost at the core of who it is to be human,

941
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,600
like what it is to be human, who we are,

942
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
like what is our history?

943
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,680
What is the nature of intelligence in the universe?

944
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,560
Are we unique?

945
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,400
Are we special?

946
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,220
Is there a great filter?

947
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,600
All these sorts of questions.

948
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,440
To answer that question,

949
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,920
you have to put together a lot of disciplines

950
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,840
existing science and speculative sort of,

951
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,280
frontiers of physics to understand,

952
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,240
well, what's the structure of reality, right?

953
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,200
Is there a multiverse?

954
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,320
Is there just this unfolding of time?

955
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,600
What are the boundary constraints of physical reality

956
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,040
that any intelligence is gonna be constrained by?

957
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,800
And then the specific kind of contingent processes

958
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,520
that give rise to intelligent life,

959
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,560
how common are those given the population of stars,

960
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,520
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

961
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,400
How can we ever get high conviction in any given model?

962
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,360
Your idea that there's like branchial space

963
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,480
that these UFOs might be able to hop across or whatever,

964
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,600
and we're in sort of this more constrained,

965
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,400
really ill space, like how is that at all?

966
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,640
I mean, that's the process of science, right?

967
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,440
But how does it become falsifiable?

968
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,040
Like even, and by the way,

969
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,680
I think Jake's testimony is completely beyond reproach

970
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,860
as well as far as like the details,

971
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,120
and I find him to be an earnest, good person.

972
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,960
But like, it was a question of like,

973
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,640
what are these things, like when they're coming down,

974
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,480
what are these things and is falsifying

975
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,480
or corroborating this even seeing an object?

976
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,840
Like is that even, like what is that then?

977
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,800
Like you're probably gonna have no idea what it is.

978
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,200
It's gonna be emitting some radiological stuff

979
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,720
and then you might get a little hurt

980
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,280
and you might have put it in a lab

981
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,800
and it might exhibit some weird properties.

982
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,960
And then at that point, what do you do?

983
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,800
What does that mean?

984
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,920
I mean, this is where, I mean,

985
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,760
I studied physics and philosophy as an undergrad

986
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,920
because I was fascinated and not obsessed

987
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,520
by this sort of the boundary layer

988
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,520
between science and philosophy, right?

989
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,080
Which is essentially philosophy is what we really

990
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,400
don't have systematized theories of knowledge for, right?

991
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,320
So the philosophy is sort of scouting out in the forest,

992
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,080
just trying to find the path, right?

993
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,800
And then you find the path and the scientists come

994
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,320
and sort of clear the path, right?

995
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,240
And so the frontier scientists are the first ones

996
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,680
into that like overbuilt, highly, you know,

997
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,060
you have thorns everywhere, right?

998
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,440
But at least the philosophers have sort of said,

999
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,960
yeah, I think there's a path here.

1000
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,960
This is basically the conceptual almost map of definitions

1001
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,480
that we're gonna analyze these more foundational concepts

1002
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,960
like almost create new concepts, right?

1003
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,480
Philosophy is often organizing human thought

1004
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,740
and systems of concepts to just help even ground hypotheses

1005
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,160
that then scientists can generate

1006
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,360
and to have to go out into the world

1007
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,840
and refine as like real systems of knowledge, right?

1008
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,320
So this is process of, you know, exploration

1009
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,240
into this dark unknown that humanity has found itself in.

1010
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,840
And so this is this basic, you know,

1011
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,880
challenge of reality is what it is

1012
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,560
and we are just, you know, flesh puppets

1013
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,400
with some, you know, higher cognitive capacities

1014
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,160
and this like being itself, what it's like to, you know,

1015
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,120
feel in sort of phenomenal first person subjective awareness

1016
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,560
that sort of lights up the machine inside.

1017
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,160
And it's like, okay, well, we're clearly,

1018
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,960
like on a first pencil's basis,

1019
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,860
we've got to do a lot of work

1020
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,360
to try to understand reality, right?

1021
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,640
It's not gonna just be handed to us.

1022
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,760
We have to do a huge amount of like conceptual development

1023
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,040
and scientific exploration to try to map on to reality,

1024
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,840
right, whatever models we have in our head

1025
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,000
to try to create a map to reality

1026
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,960
is gonna take an enormous amount of work.

1027
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,000
And the challenge, like the confrontation

1028
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
that UAPs present to us is they force us

1029
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,900
to try to basically almost short circuit

1030
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,400
what would otherwise have been if they didn't,

1031
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,560
if they weren't here, probably a much longer process

1032
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,480
of like human conceptual refinement

1033
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,120
and scientific investigation

1034
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,920
to understand what's the nature of reality,

1035
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,080
like what are the physical rules that constrain existence

1036
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,560
and what is it like to be a human subject

1037
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,920
or what's like to be a conscious subject at all?

1038
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,280
And that's, you know, that's what the Barbara story

1039
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,360
kind of really uncomfortably forces people

1040
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,400
to put together, right?

1041
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,660
Because it's not just this alien or UAP or NHI question

1042
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,400
of like advanced technology from another civilization,

1043
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,400
but it's that and apparently this aspect

1044
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,260
of human consciousness that can directly engage

1045
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,100
and almost project and interface,

1046
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:17,260
merge with that higher intelligence slash technology, right?

1047
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,820
And so those are very separate domains

1048
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:24,660
of sort of scientific and philosophical modeling

1049
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,700
and sort of inquiry, which is like fundamental physics,

1050
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,800
nature of intelligence in the universe,

1051
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,360
the boundary constraints, right?

1052
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,820
That we think any advanced civilization

1053
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,380
is gonna have to work within,

1054
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,980
that's gonna constrain the types of technology

1055
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,540
and propulsion systems and many materials

1056
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,140
they're gonna be able to construct.

1057
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,860
And then there's, well, like what is consciousness

1058
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,700
in reality, right?

1059
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,300
Is there, is it a universal field

1060
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,020
and we're just fragments or shards?

1061
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,580
Is there some sort of more, you know,

1062
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,940
sort of panpsychist interpretation that you would give

1063
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,180
and what's the sort of psychophysical relationship

1064
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,380
between consciousness and the physical world

1065
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,380
that could be, you know,

1066
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,180
intermediated with advanced forms of technology, right?

1067
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,220
And then there's this question of like, well,

1068
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,540
like is it just computational functionalism is true

1069
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,440
if you just instantiate a certain pattern,

1070
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,280
is that all you get?

1071
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,240
Is consciousness or is it consciousness

1072
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,080
is actually the substrate of reality?

1073
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,560
It's sort of what stands underneath physics.

1074
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,960
Again, these are words that I'm spewing, right?

1075
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,480
But like the words we think means something about reality.

1076
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,120
But I think the history of philosophy and science

1077
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,920
is that the words we are using at any given point in time

1078
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,160
are only like barely like trying to map on to reality

1079
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,400
as it goes back to Kant, right?

1080
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,520
It's like, we have a certain phenomenal description

1081
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,040
of reality that's kind of first person subjective field.

1082
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,240
It has constraints, it has to, you know,

1083
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,200
conform with some rules of rationality for Kant

1084
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,080
that is, you know, these are the rules

1085
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,680
that any rational mind would have to obey.

1086
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,080
And so the universe will then reflect itself

1087
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,480
in a regular organized way to that person,

1088
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,960
to that, you know, subjectivity.

1089
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,040
But that doesn't actually imply that like reality,

1090
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,560
what he called nominal is actually that, right?

1091
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,760
That feels so important for understanding what science is.

1092
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,320
And like you mentioned Jonathan Gerard,

1093
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,000
this Princeton researcher that works with Wolfram

1094
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,800
is kind of taking up the mantle there

1095
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,160
and has all sorts of interesting ideas

1096
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,000
that might actually end up applying to UAP, who knows?

1097
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,480
That's sort of your contribution.

1098
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,040
And I heard him on an interview with Kurt Jaimungal,

1099
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,960
shout out to Kurt Jaimungal, great interviewer.

1100
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,800
And he was talking about Newton and Leibniz

1101
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,320
and like how vector calculus kind of reign supreme

1102
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,880
as defining the way in which we've conceptualized the world

1103
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,640
for, you know, call it the last 400 years,

1104
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,240
350 years, whatever.

1105
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,840
And that on a go-forward basis,

1106
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,880
maybe a more computational understanding of the world

1107
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,600
will be how we kind of model the universe.

1108
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,760
And I would just say that I think he's right,

1109
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,240
but I would also say that like all of these things

1110
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,480
are like maps and they're not the territory.

1111
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,560
And so like, you know, yeah, you have these sort of

1112
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,480
heuristics for how you understand the world.

1113
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,800
And then maybe there is something more fundamental

1114
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,320
about consciousness itself.

1115
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,240
And like, it's gonna sound so cliche and trite,

1116
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,360
but like the UAP stuff points to this,

1117
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,480
like going within, reconciling with, you know,

1118
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,640
the ugliest parts of yourself, your subconscious.

1119
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,240
You know, Carl Jung would say,

1120
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,400
until you reconcile with your subconscious,

1121
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,360
you call it fate.

1122
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,160
And like, you have these mystery rituals

1123
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,560
for, you know, thousands of years

1124
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,520
where like the top thinkers, like Plato,

1125
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,280
like all these guys like went, did these mystery rituals.

1126
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,600
And it seems like it was to gain access

1127
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,960
to knowledge of their primordial soul, noesis.

1128
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,480
And so it's like, you know, we can have these mental models

1129
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,000
and like, we can, you know, draw stuff up on chalkboards

1130
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,680
and then you can like, you know,

1131
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,760
falsify it in a lab or whatever,

1132
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,240
but like maybe there's something extremely fundamental

1133
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,000
about like going within.

1134
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,120
And like, I don't know, like the Monroe,

1135
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,080
like the gateway stuff, like there are different paths,

1136
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,000
but like it's sort of, yeah,

1137
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,200
there's something actually really important about like,

1138
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,600
you know, confronting oneself

1139
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,760
in this sort of Joseph Campbell style hero's journey.

1140
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,200
How do I slay?

1141
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,920
How do you slay that dragon in me?

1142
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,400
What's the journey I have to make?

1143
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,000
You have to make, each of us has to make.

1144
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,440
You talk about something called a soul's high adventure.

1145
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,440
My general formula for my students is follow your bliss.

1146
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,960
I mean, find where it is and don't be afraid.

1147
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,440
The lesson of most faith traditions in general,

1148
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,520
and even, you know, modern day, say new agey,

1149
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,240
contemplative, transform meditation, et cetera,

1150
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,480
they've all tried to grapple with the nature of like,

1151
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,480
what it is to be a human subject, right?

1152
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,040
And the language, the vocabulary,

1153
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,600
the conceptual frameworks have evolved.

1154
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,320
It was, you know, a certain structure

1155
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,720
that fell in terms of like the human soul,

1156
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,960
you know, kind of this is the embodied sort of light

1157
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,520
of God or whatever.

1158
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,400
And then the material world is this sort of, you know,

1159
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,880
empty, again, kind of just a stage

1160
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,360
of sort of lifeless objects, right?

1161
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,960
And then there's this,

1162
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,360
a lot of people have this sort of folk duality metaphysics

1163
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,400
where what's in my head or kind of consciousness

1164
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,080
is sort of this unique substance that is, you know,

1165
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,000
somehow more primitive.

1166
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,080
And then there's the physical world,

1167
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,320
which is just sort of lifeless stuff.

1168
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,560
I think it's a primitive metaphysics.

1169
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,440
I think there's a, you know,

1170
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,720
to go to like a Gerard slash Whitehead

1171
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,760
sort of, you know, more syncretic view is,

1172
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,640
you have this dynamic computational process

1173
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,760
that's unfolding in his way.

1174
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,480
It's a sort of a multi-computational process

1175
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,320
that's unfolding.

1176
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,280
And you can describe that in a formal way,

1177
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,120
a hyper precise way to make, you know,

1178
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,480
predictions about, you know, extensions in physics.

1179
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,120
And that's what physics and science is about.

1180
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,000
But then you have to get a metaphysical interpretation

1181
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,080
of that, you know, model, right?

1182
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,160
And to account for phenomenon that are not gonna be,

1183
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,000
that are not gonna be amenable

1184
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,400
to the same sort of mathematized formalization

1185
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,400
that's a hypergraph rewriting system.

1186
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,240
And so there's a aspect of reality that is,

1187
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,480
what is it like to be a person, like a thing?

1188
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,200
We all have a first-person subjectivity

1189
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,680
that seems very real to us.

1190
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,160
And there's certain people like Daniel Dennett

1191
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,440
and sort of Patricia Churchland

1192
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,520
and that sort of school of philosopher of mine

1193
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,720
that just deny the reality of first-person subjectivity

1194
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,840
that qualia aren't real, right?

1195
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,760
It's all just words we say.

1196
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,240
We don't actually have anything that's like to be us

1197
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,360
or there's no such thing as redness.

1198
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,000
I think that's dangerous.

1199
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,200
Yeah, but that is a very strong philosophical view

1200
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,040
that it's been very successful

1201
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,760
because of a technological paradigm

1202
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,200
that seemed to support it over time,

1203
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,240
which is this idea of just programming, right?

1204
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,840
This idea of just writing down abstract instructions

1205
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,960
on a computer can unlock huge amounts

1206
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,600
of complicated behavior.

1207
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,400
And like, you know, what looks to be now

1208
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,680
in these AI systems, like approaching human level,

1209
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,880
you know, output, right?

1210
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,600
Or sort of mimicry in some sense.

1211
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,760
And so that has, from a certain naive perspective,

1212
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,480
well, if we can construct purely computational systems,

1213
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,800
you know, just, you know, big weights of numbers, right?

1214
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,160
Sort of doing matrix multiplication

1215
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,200
and they can spit out, you know,

1216
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,040
yeah, this is the Turing test.

1217
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,040
They can spit out outputs

1218
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,280
that are fundamentally indistinguishable from human output.

1219
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,200
Well, then maybe we should just believe

1220
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,720
that that's all that we are, right?

1221
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,360
And, you know, but of course, at the end of the day,

1222
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,640
to get this philosophy of mine argument,

1223
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,960
you have to go back to like,

1224
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,200
if I punch you, it's gonna hurt, right?

1225
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,440
Like, that's not something I can write down

1226
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,040
in any sort of system of formal equations.

1227
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,960
There's just an irreducible feature of existence

1228
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,080
that only is accessible to a first person,

1229
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,720
you know, subject that is real.

1230
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,840
And, you know, that's like the first branch of the tree

1231
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,400
that philosophers of mind divergent.

1232
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,520
And then there's different branches

1233
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,480
that people have taken over time.

1234
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,560
But I think this is where, for me, again,

1235
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,720
I come from this somewhat analytic philosophical tradition.

1236
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,200
But at the same time, there's been, I think,

1237
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,680
a weakness in that tradition.

1238
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,320
It's been very austere and it's obsessed

1239
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,240
with hyperformalism and sort of making these

1240
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,920
very restrained and couched arguments.

1241
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,680
And then the rest of society just wants to understand

1242
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,560
and gets like, get to a first level understanding

1243
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,400
of what's really happening in the world.

1244
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,240
So you have these other,

1245
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,560
you have these different traditions, right?

1246
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,840
That are, you know, go under like sort of new age philosophy

1247
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,920
that goes back to, you know, kind of Hegel and Schelling

1248
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,360
and kind of the German romanticists, you know,

1249
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,920
have sort of been reinterpreted over many decades

1250
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,520
and then kind of give birth to this sort of modern

1251
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,360
sort of metaphysics.

1252
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,960
It's very popular in the UAP community, right?

1253
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,640
Which is consciousness and light beings

1254
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,680
and meditative practices and it's like we're rediscovering

1255
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,520
a lot of like ancient sort of knowledge, right?

1256
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,520
It's just being reinterpreted through our modern frames.

1257
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,360
It's all ancient.

1258
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,560
And belief systems.

1259
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,680
But even then it's like those ancient belief systems

1260
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,520
were just, those were just the new age philosophies

1261
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,560
of the day, right?

1262
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,880
Like I, again, I, maybe I'm just,

1263
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,640
this is my training or juxtaposition.

1264
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,880
I like to have, I want to try to take that as a guide

1265
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,200
to then try to systematize and formalize as much as I can.

1266
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,160
Well, what does that say about reality, right?

1267
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,600
We're just using words when we say, you know,

1268
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,640
consciousness or light energy or look inside, right?

1269
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,480
Those are, well, what was that?

1270
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,320
That's very true.

1271
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,480
Like you need to stitch it together

1272
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,120
in a cohesive worldview that is on the one hand,

1273
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,560
scientifically rigorous and formal and on the one hand,

1274
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,120
you know, philosophically speculative and exploratory.

1275
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,760
But you need to always have to like

1276
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,280
try to pull those threads together.

1277
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,560
Well, it's always funny when people say, you know,

1278
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,200
aliens are just angels and demons.

1279
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,800
And then I ask them what's an angel and what's a demon.

1280
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,560
That descriptor is in no way helpful, you know,

1281
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,280
more helpful incrementally, you know,

1282
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,040
compared to an alien or whatever.

1283
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,720
And so like you're equally completely clueless

1284
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,520
in both cases and you're just sort of like,

1285
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,400
it's almost more of like a political polemic

1286
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,120
that you're trying to say, you know,

1287
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,760
it all just goes back to a tradition,

1288
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,400
but you're right, in many ways,

1289
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,280
the tradition is just as impenetrable

1290
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,240
as this new agey veneer that, you know,

1291
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,560
we have or whatever.

1292
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,360
And I think fundamentally we need to create new concepts,

1293
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,200
new worldviews that are based in a scientific practice,

1294
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,040
but are not restricted by the prevailing,

1295
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,200
what I would call sort of metaphysical assumptions, right?

1296
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,360
So I think that's right.

1297
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,360
And then I also think, you know, the concept of Lindy.

1298
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,200
Yeah.

1299
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,480
You know, like, you know, something's expected

1300
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,480
or something's current age is a, you know,

1301
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,240
predictor of its, you know, future age.

1302
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,280
And so like it's every generation's, you know,

1303
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,360
job to sort of kill off bad ideas.

1304
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,760
You know, the ideas that are like not that good,

1305
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,240
don't survive that long.

1306
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,080
And so like, on some level,

1307
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,480
I do understand kind of hearkening back to older traditions

1308
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,680
and saying it is all just like this stuff,

1309
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,280
like you're not discovering something new,

1310
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,440
because it actually does give you

1311
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,320
at least fuller metaphor phenomenological,

1312
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,880
like, you know, social map of like our understanding

1313
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,000
of this stuff, how we've interacted with it.

1314
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,080
And it doesn't, you're not throwing out any progress

1315
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,520
that's made in the past as a result of, you know,

1316
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,200
whatever interactions we've had with UAPs or, you know,

1317
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,200
these things or consciousness or whatever.

1318
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,360
So I do think, you know, it's like Alcibiades was like,

1319
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,000
was killed for like, you know,

1320
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,360
talking about the mysteries at Eleusis or whatever.

1321
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,120
And traditionally, I think some of these things

1322
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,000
that we're touching on now in the UAP context,

1323
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,920
you, if you, if you attempt them

1324
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,760
in some sort of like willy nilly way,

1325
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,520
like things go very bad for you.

1326
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,880
And so like, you know, I think,

1327
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,840
I think it's actually kind of important to know that

1328
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,200
and to not just like wholesale, you know, democratize,

1329
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,200
like Stephen Greer, who this was a total mixed bag,

1330
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,320
I think in many ways is being vindicated now actually

1331
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,400
for his really good investigative work.

1332
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,040
But he's of the mind that you can just like,

1333
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,840
sort of try to call these things in.

1334
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,920
And it's like, I don't know about that.

1335
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,440
I don't think that's a good idea, but what do you think?

1336
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,280
Well, this is why I think a greater crime

1337
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,880
than the like alleged legacy program,

1338
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,000
technology, secret science, secret physics crime,

1339
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,320
is this what you could somewhat interpret

1340
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,280
as a spiritual crime.

1341
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,000
I would view it as more, you know,

1342
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,960
essentially a philosophical crime

1343
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,960
and people think that's a trivial.

1344
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,320
But for me, a philosophical crime is the highest crime.

1345
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,680
Because it's like, what is the highest pursuit of humanity

1346
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,920
is to understand reality.

1347
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,120
And to do that, you need to have as much access

1348
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,160
to whatever clues reality will provide to you

1349
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,880
to then stitch together in an ever evolving

1350
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,600
and uncertain basis, like a picture of the world, right?

1351
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,640
What is really happening?

1352
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,760
Like what are the core phenomenon

1353
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,720
that I need to account for, right?

1354
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,880
In a coherent picture of existence.

1355
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,160
And if there's an entire set of phenomenon

1356
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,880
that the US government or other entities

1357
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,880
have just been, you know, intentionally withholding

1358
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,760
that would provide, you know, ammunition for

1359
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,760
or ingredients to construct a much more integrative

1360
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,320
and holistic view of reality,

1361
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,680
then we're all impoverished fundamentally

1362
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,400
and almost spiritually metaphysically

1363
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,280
in my sort of more neutral language.

1364
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,400
And that is, that's more for me of like a,

1365
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,520
an abrogation of an insult, right?

1366
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,040
And like withholding classified physics,

1367
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,280
like that's a problem.

1368
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,840
But that's like, it's a problem

1369
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,800
underneath this larger problem, right?

1370
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,480
It's, because then I think what's what you need to move,

1371
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,080
you know, overall human civilization forward

1372
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,440
is you need to have everyone operating

1373
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,880
on as close to a basis of truth as possible.

1374
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,720
Yep.

1375
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,800
Like systematic, you know, error compounds over time

1376
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,760
and leads to pathologies and usually catastrophic failures.

1377
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,000
And like proper institutions are always,

1378
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,520
always about trying to get as close to reality as possible.

1379
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,360
Right?

1380
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,960
Like ultimately, if you want to have an effective,

1381
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,800
you know, organization, a company, a product,

1382
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,200
a belief system, it should be like,

1383
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,280
you should be trying to get it close to reality.

1384
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,560
But is not the biggest sigh up of all the idea

1385
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,720
that the government has a greater metaphysical

1386
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,080
or ontological understanding of reality at all

1387
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,800
versus these locally useful techniques

1388
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,960
where they can like, you know, derive certain benefits

1389
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,720
from interactions or whatever.

1390
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,160
Like, I think those are two very different types.

1391
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah, no, 100%.

1392
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,960
I don't think the government has like a secret

1393
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,320
sort of scroll of knowledge, right?

1394
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,160
I agree, yeah.

1395
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,520
That's like, we are the truth keepers

1396
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,320
and we're holding the truth back from people.

1397
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,720
It's more like they're withholding basic facts, right?

1398
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,560
Tons of data.

1399
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,520
Like apparently something like human capacities

1400
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,680
for conscious engagements with advanced technology

1401
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,920
is a thing that's like a real phenomenon in the world.

1402
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,680
Do they have like a fundamentally, you know,

1403
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,360
grounded ontologically, you know, close to the metal,

1404
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,680
you know, theory of physics and metaphysics

1405
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,120
that accounts for all of that?

1406
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,240
I'm highly skeptical, right?

1407
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,080
I am too.

1408
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,400
They figure out some tricks and some protocols.

1409
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,280
They realize that there's certain individuals

1410
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,600
that have an inherent predisposition for this.

1411
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,600
They maybe have figured out genetic, you know,

1412
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,240
lines that are just naturally disposed for this.

1413
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,280
They figure out maybe some cocktails of drugs

1414
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,560
to give to people in a training regiment when they're young

1415
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,320
and then they get them into these programs

1416
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,000
and they, you know, I basically adapted almost

1417
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,560
on a like trial and error basis.

1418
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,760
Let's dive a little into that

1419
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,360
because that does also seem to be coming out now

1420
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,400
and it's not, it's really strange

1421
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,200
and it's not something you can like really paint over.

1422
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,040
It's hard to put lipstick on that pig.

1423
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,000
That's a weird thing that the government

1424
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,680
has been systematically finding high-sciability,

1425
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,520
you know, mind over matter capable children

1426
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,840
across the country for decades

1427
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,960
and basically doing parapsychological experiments

1428
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,120
with them where it's like collapse a sine wave

1429
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,280
or, you know, look at this material.

1430
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,280
Do you react to the material?

1431
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,480
And then like, yeah, inducing certain stress states

1432
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,240
so they can, you know, be more functional

1433
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,480
as far as these out-of-body experiences

1434
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,840
and trying to garner esoteric information from them.

1435
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,200
What do you make of all of that?

1436
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,640
And do you think, I mean, how prevalent was that?

1437
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,680
Is that how, you know, how big of a thing is that?

1438
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,160
If you put a few things together

1439
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,120
and you're trying to construct like a scenario here,

1440
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,080
it is interesting, right?

1441
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,840
So imagine for the sake of argument

1442
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,440
that the psionics capability is real, right?

1443
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,560
Well, then you got to have to ask some basic questions like,

1444
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,680
well, what's the effective range, right,

1445
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,080
for a given psionic asset to perform a certain operation,

1446
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,840
whether it's to summon down, take control of,

1447
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,320
pilot, engage, communicate, you know, whatever.

1448
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,760
Like it's, you know, it's, yeah, again,

1449
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,080
your assumptions there could be everything

1450
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,640
from they can read across the universe

1451
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,360
or they have to be within line of sight

1452
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,680
within like a kilometer or somewhere in between, right?

1453
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,000
So if you assume for the sake of argument

1454
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,360
that there's some, there's some constraint, right?

1455
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,880
There's some physical distance

1456
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,760
where the operational effectiveness

1457
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,440
of the psionic asset is constrained,

1458
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,080
then okay, you have a global, say, you know, operation.

1459
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,420
You need to have a global footprint of those assets

1460
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,520
to perform activities where you never, you know, who knows?

1461
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,160
Maybe there's certain activities that you need to have

1462
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,520
in certain parts of the world to detect UAP, like NHI craft.

1463
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,280
But if it's true that there's some ability

1464
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,000
for humans to control this technology,

1465
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,800
well then you also have to build into this scenario,

1466
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,200
this hypothetical that we haven't been able

1467
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,360
to like fully reproduce, like reproduction vehicles, right?

1468
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,160
That are, you know, all these crazy mini materials

1469
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,000
or whatever, but if we have our own, say,

1470
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,160
fully intact craft and we know how special site

1471
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,900
psychic pilots can fly them,

1472
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,180
well then you have to build a scenario

1473
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:20,220
where there are non-human craft being piloted by humans.

1474
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,380
And then you have to build into that scenario,

1475
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:25,620
well, if American or contracted associated American groups

1476
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,060
can do that, well then maybe adversary groups can do that.

1477
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,940
And so then if you're in this scenario

1478
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,180
where there are actual non-human craft, you know,

1479
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,940
who is maybe operational locations you're trying to monitor

1480
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:40,620
or, you know, you would just need to have a presence

1481
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,980
around the world because you don't really know

1482
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,720
what they're going, what's going on.

1483
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,040
And or you have, you know, human groups that are, you know,

1484
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,280
piloting using psionic capabilities,

1485
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,680
non-human craft that they've recovered

1486
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,440
and then start to operationalize.

1487
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,760
And then, and then it's like,

1488
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,080
so there's this crazy exotic scenario built in here,

1489
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,480
but then it's really not that different

1490
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,920
from a traditional military ISR global sort of,

1491
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,440
you know, competition, right?

1492
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,280
Where you try to get as close to your adversaries

1493
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,240
operations as possible to monitor what they're doing, right?

1494
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,280
With as much of a deniable presence as possible.

1495
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,000
So you would use your covert special stuff to do that.

1496
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,900
And you would get, you know, near your adversary,

1497
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,080
China, et cetera.

1498
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,960
And then if there's a disaster, you're like,

1499
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,840
oh, we're worried about these assets being burned

1500
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,960
or they're really valuable.

1501
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:24,840
So we need to get them out.

1502
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,200
So that's, that's the evacuation procedure, right?

1503
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,360
And then it turns out these Marines

1504
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,720
stumbled on the evacuation and that's okay.

1505
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,080
How do I create a scenario that explains

1506
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,280
a psionic asset team with a non-human craft in Indonesia

1507
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,760
that's witnessed by Michael Herrera, right?

1508
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,240
And a prima facie absurd thing.

1509
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,080
But if you load in things from Jacob Barber's story

1510
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,840
and a basic SOP about how any sort of operation

1511
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,760
would be constructed, right?

1512
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,080
That's based on those facts.

1513
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,920
Okay, you can come up with a plausible explanation

1514
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,920
to that inherently implausible scenario.

1515
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,120
Well, it's funny.

1516
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,760
I said, I was like, you know, maybe it was this like

1517
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,860
human trafficking psionic asset transfer operation.

1518
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,360
He was like, or maybe, you know,

1519
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,860
the program was like running out there

1520
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,160
and they were like trying to get out

1521
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,420
because the earthquake had hit.

1522
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,480
So it's kind of like what you said,

1523
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,280
like they were like, you know, evacuating

1524
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,500
and they sort of ran into Herrera's unit.

1525
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,780
I mean, again, just taking the facts at issue

1526
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,460
and trying to construct a plausible story

1527
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,020
that's consistent with these other pieces, right?

1528
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,860
If you don't put the other pieces together,

1529
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,260
it's very hard to tell a plausible story.

1530
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,620
Yep.

1531
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,820
But yeah, but that's the part that's,

1532
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:28,700
I think people are increasingly hinting at, right?

1533
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:32,860
You could go back to Grushin and Carlinel sub-rosa Cold War

1534
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,180
to retrieve or reverse engineer the stuff.

1535
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,220
Well, the psionics part is a part of that retrieval program

1536
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,540
and reverse engineering program.

1537
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,580
Well, then there's gonna be a sub-rosa Cold War

1538
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,700
for psionic assets around the world

1539
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,340
to retrieve and reverse engineer and control,

1540
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,580
you know, human intelligence.

1541
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,500
Like that's just like a slight modification

1542
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,740
of the original Grush statement.

1543
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,060
Yeah, totally.

1544
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,820
Well, do you have a base case on how far we've come

1545
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:59,140
when it comes to actually reverse engineering these things?

1546
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:02,140
I am, I'm open to the possibility

1547
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,620
that a lot of technology has been inspired

1548
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,960
that would be considered very advanced

1549
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,020
from the state of like what's in the open domain,

1550
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,140
different parts of the tech tree, advanced materials,

1551
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,860
I think, you know, would probably be the most likely candidate.

1552
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,060
I also think the psionics thing

1553
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,020
is certainly probably the most, you know,

1554
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:18,900
most people wouldn't think about that

1555
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,260
as reverse engineering, but for me,

1556
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,580
it's like clearly inspired technology, right?

1557
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:27,060
It's like there's a certain way of activating,

1558
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:30,300
engaging, training, enhancing certain human capacities

1559
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,820
to perform operational capabilities, you know,

1560
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,300
that are military intelligence, you know, related.

1561
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,540
Like that's, that would,

1562
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,460
I don't think we would have gotten that potentially

1563
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,180
without these things, if that's true,

1564
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:45,420
which seems increasingly likely to be the case.

1565
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,220
Antigravity, the whole Thompson-Thompson,

1566
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:50,340
you know, Brown stuff is,

1567
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:54,540
it's a tougher thing for me to stretch to at the moment.

1568
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,380
Like could we have sort of inspired prototypes

1569
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:05,380
like the Pais stuff that we have a drawing board ideas on?

1570
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:06,420
Probably.

1571
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,100
Do we have the engineering acumen and materials

1572
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:14,020
to operationalize or even develop prototypes for that?

1573
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:17,300
Like, you know, on our own tech tree without, you know,

1574
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,780
grafting something on from a non-human craft.

1575
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:21,700
I'm skeptical of that.

1576
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,980
Cause I think, you know,

1577
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,660
even if we have a theoretical foundation

1578
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:28,780
for say vacuum polarization or this sort of, you know,

1579
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,420
extended electrodynamics, you've got these,

1580
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,060
like this coupling with high,

1581
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,900
like extremely high magnetic field

1582
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,100
sort of frequency variations

1583
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,900
and you're doing some crazy topological insulators, right?

1584
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,980
With the sort of missile man stuff.

1585
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,500
Like there's like, I think we have hints

1586
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,860
of where we can explore, you know,

1587
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:48,540
potential next moves on propulsion and materials.

1588
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:52,140
But I just think you have to build a whole stack

1589
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,300
of technologies and stacks of physics

1590
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,900
and engineering knowledge

1591
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,820
that I just don't think we're anywhere close.

1592
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,500
So even if we think we have like the physics,

1593
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,860
the theoretical physics worked out,

1594
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:03,940
I just don't think we're close

1595
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,500
to having like the engineering,

1596
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:10,140
like materials stack built up yet to realize that.

1597
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,140
But this is where I think

1598
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,180
there's an interesting middle ground scenario,

1599
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,740
which seems to be lent more credence

1600
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:17,220
by what the sky watcher folks like Jordan

1601
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,460
in particular was saying.

1602
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,340
If you take a story, which, you know,

1603
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,420
I have no evidence one way or the other,

1604
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,900
but I think he's a credible person.

1605
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:28,460
But he says explicitly, it's like the psionic activity

1606
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:32,540
isn't, it's like a mind meld with this conscious craft.

1607
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,420
And effectively there's like control modules

1608
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,780
that you essentially take over.

1609
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:39,500
And it's like this sort of, you know,

1610
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,460
this orb that's a conscious sort of AI, you know,

1611
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,940
super craft thing that's just,

1612
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,220
it's just waiting to be kind of like, you know,

1613
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,180
not hijacked, but kind of like, you know,

1614
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,980
if you're ready, you can sort of, you know,

1615
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,420
take me for a spin, right?

1616
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:53,700
Like let's do a little mind meld

1617
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:54,940
and then I'll show you how to like

1618
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,820
zip around with your consciousness here.

1619
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,540
And if that's, you know, again,

1620
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:00,660
hard pill to swallow from a certain scientific

1621
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:01,820
and metaphysical perspective,

1622
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,300
but if you just take it at face value,

1623
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:06,380
well, that would then make more likely a scenario where,

1624
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:10,300
you know, we can control non-human craft

1625
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,820
without having the ability to make them, right?

1626
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,340
Which almost wouldn't explain

1627
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:18,780
why the retrieval program is so important, right?

1628
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,460
Because we actually have really no hope

1629
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,420
of truly reverse engineering our own, you know,

1630
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:28,340
super luminal, anti-gravity, whatever, right?

1631
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,660
But, you know, the real constraint is

1632
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:33,540
whoever gets the most of them has the most of these things.

1633
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,020
Right, and so it's like, you know,

1634
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,700
the production rate of F-35s

1635
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,540
versus Chinese hypersonic missiles is like a, you know,

1636
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,020
it's like, who's got the most, the range,

1637
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,460
it's always about parity, right?

1638
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:45,860
And if nobody really has the ability to manufacture them,

1639
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,020
then the only strategic, you know, measure

1640
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:51,020
is who's be able to get the most,

1641
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,500
train the most stasonic assets,

1642
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,660
and then operationalize as many of these craft as possible.

1643
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,620
Well, then that would put an intense strategic pressure

1644
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,500
on these great powers to do that.

1645
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,980
Right, and it would also, I think,

1646
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,500
create an immense competitive pressure

1647
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,980
within these same institutions

1648
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,020
and their associated contractor ecosystems.

1649
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:10,180
Because it's like, this also would explain

1650
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,580
the whole weird parts of the Barber story

1651
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:15,380
where it implies there's like contractor teams

1652
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:18,340
and mercenary, you know, you know,

1653
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:19,420
we're like retrieval units,

1654
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,060
all kind of competing over this stuff.

1655
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:21,980
Yeah.

1656
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:25,180
In that sense, like, you know, Lockheed and Northrop

1657
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:27,580
or SAIC or whoever that you presume

1658
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,780
is involved in this stuff,

1659
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:31,260
neither of them has a real competitive advantage

1660
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:34,380
on creating like new units, right?

1661
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,540
Like F-35s versus whatever.

1662
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,780
The only differentiator between them is like,

1663
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:41,660
who's got the most, you know, who's got the most stuff?

1664
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,460
Who's got the most assets and, you know,

1665
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,660
both sonic assets as well as craft.

1666
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:49,020
And that's just, that's a competitive, you know, dynamic

1667
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,660
that you could see these institutions, you know.

1668
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,580
Well, all of this is predicated

1669
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,900
on this sort of Philip J. Corso narrative

1670
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:59,300
that like you can derive any sort of material benefit.

1671
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:02,180
And when I say material, I mean, literally like materials

1672
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:04,260
benefit that can work its way

1673
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,820
into any sort of existing technology stack.

1674
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,300
And so I guess that narrative specifically,

1675
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,540
which actually seems to be getting

1676
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,340
sort of more and more corroborated again,

1677
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,380
Jason Sands going on Rogan.

1678
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:18,060
And, you know, this could be circular reporting, who knows?

1679
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,220
But like, he was talking about radars, you know,

1680
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:24,780
high powered radars at Roswell and White Sands

1681
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:27,580
actually disrupting flight paths of the crafts.

1682
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:29,500
Rogan actually expressed skepticism,

1683
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,460
but it actually sort of makes sense

1684
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,620
from like a physics standpoint that radar might disrupt

1685
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:37,420
some, you know, exotic craft like this.

1686
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:40,860
And, you know, the stuff comes down and then, you know,

1687
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,020
it gets collected, it gets taken to Roscoe Hillencoder

1688
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,860
who's the first director of the CIA.

1689
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:48,460
And then Philip J. Corso, who is the, you know,

1690
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:52,220
chief of the Army's Foreign Technology Exploitation Desk.

1691
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:55,140
He is given the material and that material

1692
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,740
is systematically doled out to the private sector,

1693
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:59,140
namely Bell Labs.

1694
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:03,620
And so he says everything from Kevlar lasers

1695
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:06,540
to the transistor, you know,

1696
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:09,540
or maybe it's not just the transistor,

1697
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,500
maybe it's like some sort of thing essential

1698
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,580
to integrated circuits and fiber optics.

1699
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,540
Like all of these things are derivative

1700
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:18,020
of these materials from Roswell.

1701
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,100
Do you believe that?

1702
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:24,180
I mean, it's hard, like I haven't done the deep analysis

1703
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:27,380
of that, but like, as far as my shallow understanding

1704
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:31,220
is there's no major like gaps if you tried to like

1705
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:34,500
retell the history of that tech tree development

1706
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,740
from transistors to fiber optics.

1707
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:40,460
Like it's, there's no like mysterious, you know,

1708
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:43,180
oh, like all of a sudden we now have this new thing

1709
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:45,380
that like nobody has an idea where it came from.

1710
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,020
There was like patterns of individuals

1711
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,620
working in discrete research units

1712
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:51,380
with like a tech antecedent that then was modified

1713
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,980
with a certain technical, you know,

1714
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,340
breakthrough that then was merged and you get this,

1715
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,940
you know, what seems like a characteristic

1716
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,540
tech development tree.

1717
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:01,060
And isn't there a patent on transistors

1718
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,340
from like Munich in the 1930s or something?

1719
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,500
Yeah, I mean, there was, I mean,

1720
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,260
a lot of people since the beginning of electricity

1721
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,100
and the knowledge of basic circuitry

1722
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:11,940
and the related equations was like,

1723
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:14,260
okay, there's just an engineering question like,

1724
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:16,100
can you do this in a cost-effective way

1725
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,820
and, you know, to get the right materials

1726
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,900
and then start building some of these devices.

1727
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,140
It wasn't like, oh, we don't know how to make

1728
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:24,060
integrated circuit and fiber optics is like,

1729
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:25,180
oh, this is crazy advanced.

1730
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:26,300
It's like, okay, you just need like

1731
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,660
sufficiently transparent crystal glass

1732
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:31,540
and you just need to like, you know, protect it

1733
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:33,740
and then have a way to generate, you know,

1734
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:36,620
a photon source that's correlated to some analog circuit

1735
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,620
and you can just generate signal.

1736
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:43,020
Like these weren't like magical things.

1737
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:45,460
They had a characteristic antecedent

1738
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,140
and there's no mystery embedded in it.

1739
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:49,700
And I think part of that whole Corso thing,

1740
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,580
I think is, you know, I don't know if it's intentional,

1741
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,500
seems like disinformation, seems like passage material.

1742
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,540
Do you think it was?

1743
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,340
I don't know, I mean, but it would make sense

1744
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:00,140
if it's like, you're worried that this idea

1745
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:02,100
of there being non-human intelligence,

1746
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:05,260
you know, technology unknown origin material out there,

1747
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:09,220
you want to try to like throw a shaft at the Russians

1748
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:12,620
or whoever who at that point, and it seems like you like,

1749
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:13,940
they know that we know that they know

1750
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,500
kind of sort of thing that this is going on.

1751
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,300
And so you're not trying to convince the Russians

1752
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,380
this isn't real.

1753
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:21,460
You're just trying to obfuscate to the Russians

1754
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,540
and maybe puff up your chest

1755
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:26,300
about what you figured out, right, about this stuff.

1756
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,020
Like, oh yeah, we figured out all this stuff.

1757
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:28,860
Well, it's funny.

1758
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:33,140
He was also Corso on the psychological strategy board

1759
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:33,980
under Eisenhower.

1760
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:37,380
So it was like all military psychological operations

1761
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,580
where like, it was Gordon Gray

1762
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:41,860
and it was this other guy, Charles Douglas Jackson

1763
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:43,020
and you know, Philip Corso.

1764
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:46,500
And a lot of the early alien lore

1765
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,580
comes from that nexus of people, which I find interesting.

1766
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,860
A lot of it was, I mean, there's even a,

1767
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,820
I believe a memo from Walter B. Smith

1768
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:58,180
who I believe took over the CIA in 52, 53.

1769
01:08:58,180 --> 01:08:59,020
And he's saying, you know,

1770
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:01,620
how do we use the UFO phenomena?

1771
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,660
And I always find this interesting

1772
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:05,260
because he doesn't say, let's make up the UFO phenomena.

1773
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:08,660
He says, you know, the whole memo is predicated on the,

1774
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:12,500
you know, the tacit acceptance of this.

1775
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,860
Actually, he's like writing about it

1776
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:14,900
in this sort of banal way.

1777
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,820
Like, of course there's a UFO phenomena.

1778
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,660
Let's figure out how to kind of operationalize it

1779
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,060
against the Soviets.

1780
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:25,780
And so, yeah, do you think that that's been done in the past?

1781
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:29,820
Yes, I mean, I think the best cover stories

1782
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,700
are based on a germ of truth

1783
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:36,700
that you distort and you mix in with a bunch of untruths.

1784
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:40,340
And that's what makes it a good operation.

1785
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,300
So it makes it effective

1786
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,020
and enduring counterintelligence operation.

1787
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,940
Do you think Bob Lazar is an example of that?

1788
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,020
Like, what's your belief on Bob Lazar?

1789
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,780
So Bob Lazar, for the audience,

1790
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:51,380
claimed to have worked at S4,

1791
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:54,940
which was, you know, a special compartment of Area 51.

1792
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:56,460
And he was recruited there

1793
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:59,580
because he, I guess, slapped like a ramjet

1794
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,020
on the back of a Honda or something.

1795
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:04,140
And then he met Edward Teller serendipitously

1796
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,100
and he gets recruited to this program.

1797
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:09,420
And he claims that he was working on, you know,

1798
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:12,540
a craft that looked like Billy Myers,

1799
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,820
who was a Swiss ufologist.

1800
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,420
And he would describe the sports model,

1801
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,500
so the saucer-shaped craft.

1802
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,820
And he describes certain frameworks

1803
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,540
like Gravity A and Gravity B

1804
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,300
as far as working on the craft.

1805
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:28,940
And it's with remarkable level of detail and lucidity

1806
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,260
that he's described all this stuff.

1807
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,340
And he came out in Rogan and sort of talked about it.

1808
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:34,900
But there's some weird things in his history and past.

1809
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:38,300
And I've actually become increasingly of the mind

1810
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:43,300
that the prima facie story is real.

1811
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:44,140
But then I don't know.

1812
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,900
Is it passage material or, yeah?

1813
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,420
Yeah, I think it's the same sort of thing,

1814
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:48,900
which is there's probably a germ of truth

1815
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,540
in what he's saying.

1816
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:52,300
But I think it's very, very hard,

1817
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,740
maybe impossible to really carve out.

1818
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,340
Is it 10% of that?

1819
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,100
Is it 80% of that?

1820
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,820
I don't think it's 0%.

1821
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,180
I think now that I've had to sort of update my prize

1822
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,580
very significantly to the reality of these programs

1823
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:05,780
and the reality of non-human intelligence

1824
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:07,340
and these related technologies,

1825
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:09,220
then it seems somewhat irrational to be like,

1826
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:12,420
oh, well, the first guy to say that is just wrong.

1827
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,100
Yeah, right, right, right, right.

1828
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:15,900
You kind of have to be rational

1829
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,820
and sort of reset your assessment

1830
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,540
and take all the kind of cruft in the personalities

1831
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:21,500
and the different narratives

1832
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,740
that have been shaped over decades

1833
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:24,540
and just kind of like go to first principles,

1834
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:26,220
be like, well, without anything else,

1835
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,220
it does raise the probability

1836
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,340
that he was telling the truth, right?

1837
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:30,860
If it turns out these programs are real,

1838
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,860
then it raises the chance

1839
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:34,540
that he was involved in some capacity.

1840
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:37,140
But it doesn't at all endorse

1841
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,820
or force you to raise your credences

1842
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:41,060
in all the other things he said, right?

1843
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:43,620
Which clearly have aspects of embellishments

1844
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:47,620
and kind of changing sort of details over time.

1845
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:49,700
But so you can get to this nuanced picture,

1846
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:53,180
which is parts of his story are probably credible

1847
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,140
and then parts are very not, right?

1848
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:59,260
And I think it's more of a historical story at this point.

1849
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,220
Like, I don't think it's much more

1850
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,780
in the way of disclosure information

1851
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:05,020
you're gonna get out of that episode.

1852
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,100
Do you have a belief on what's true and what's not

1853
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,300
or sort of anybody's guess or?

1854
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,260
On him or just in general?

1855
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,100
On him, I mean.

1856
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:14,980
No, I mean, I think it's likely that he was involved

1857
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:17,380
in some parts of the program, these like things.

1858
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:20,780
And maybe he was, and I think it's plausible he saw craft.

1859
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:23,140
But I mean, you look at all these other stories,

1860
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:23,980
it's so compartmented

1861
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:25,980
and the people that are brought in are brought in

1862
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,220
with a very particular reason.

1863
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,260
And it seems clear that they're only told

1864
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,100
what they need to know.

1865
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,020
And then a lot of what they're told

1866
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,100
is likely disinformation

1867
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,220
that's not really related to their function, right?

1868
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:43,220
Like, you would not tell just every piece of the puzzle

1869
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:44,660
like what the puzzle is, right?

1870
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,660
You would tell them how to draw what the borders are.

1871
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:48,700
And then the rest of the puzzle,

1872
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:51,780
you'd probably come up with a total cockamamie story for it.

1873
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:52,900
Cause they don't need to know, right?

1874
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,420
But you need to tell them something.

1875
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,100
So you say it's from Alcicentauri,

1876
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,620
you say it's gravity A, gravity B,

1877
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:59,100
you tell them all this stuff.

1878
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,940
It's like, okay, like, but he's got a very narrow thing.

1879
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:03,100
He's like more of a technician.

1880
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,740
He's just got to lift certain things

1881
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:06,140
and go to certain places and just, you know,

1882
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:07,460
there's certain physical things that have to get done,

1883
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:09,020
but he's not the grand genius

1884
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,660
that's supposed to figure out the basic physics here.

1885
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,140
He's just being told a story.

1886
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:16,540
Again, that's just like a hot take.

1887
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:19,260
I think what's interesting is in the Jacob Barber story,

1888
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:21,180
it's like, yeah, like he knows what he saw.

1889
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:24,460
He knows what he experienced, but he's just a delivery guy.

1890
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:28,580
So he can kind of tell you with a high degree of fidelity,

1891
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:32,220
like what was under the cone of light from his helicopter.

1892
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,900
But like, he can't tell you

1893
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,180
what was happening under the bunkers.

1894
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,100
He can't tell you what was happening

1895
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,460
with these research institutes and this, you know,

1896
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:42,020
sprawling disconnected compartmentalized archipelago, right?

1897
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,140
And so there's an elephant here

1898
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:47,100
and each, you know, these individual cases comes out.

1899
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,580
It's like, oh, this is the toenail.

1900
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,420
This is the tail.

1901
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,220
This is the tusk.

1902
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:52,580
And you're like, I think there's an elephant here,

1903
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:54,060
but how big is it, right?

1904
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,060
Is it one elephant?

1905
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:55,900
Is there actually five

1906
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,700
and they're touching different elephants, right?

1907
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,620
This is the part that's very hard to discern.

1908
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:01,820
You've just got this like soda straw

1909
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,780
of apparently vertical experience

1910
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:06,060
mixed in with potentially disinformation.

1911
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:08,580
Like who knows what the corso stuff.

1912
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:10,820
And this is the detective story.

1913
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,300
This is why it's, you know,

1914
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,220
human beings, we love these sorts of pattern matching,

1915
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,740
especially certain cognitive phenotypes

1916
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:17,020
where we'd love to just obsess.

1917
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,380
Like some people like doing puzzles, right?

1918
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:20,940
And so you're just like, oh, is this one puzzle?

1919
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:23,260
But it's like, it turns out somebody was screwing with you

1920
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:26,140
and just mixed in a bunch of other puzzle pieces in there.

1921
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:28,260
It's like, well, you're going to have trouble.

1922
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:29,900
And that's what they think this is, right?

1923
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,940
Like somebody just mixed a bunch of puzzle pieces

1924
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,900
from different puzzles together.

1925
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,700
And, you know, some people will just be like,

1926
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,820
oh, it's all, there's no one puzzle here.

1927
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:39,620
This is all just noise, right?

1928
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,580
And then there's some people who are just like,

1929
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:43,580
oh, wait a second, I think this is the one puzzle

1930
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:44,420
I need to figure out

1931
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,820
and I just need to throw these other pieces away, right?

1932
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:48,420
And that's a lot of work.

1933
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,460
And you never really, there's no guarantee of success

1934
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,500
because you don't know what the ratio is.

1935
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,060
Like you can be there all day.

1936
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,860
Speaking of puzzle pieces,

1937
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:57,980
you're one of the few people who've spent in-person time

1938
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:00,020
with this guy, Harold Malmgren.

1939
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:03,140
And Harold was a top presidential advisor

1940
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:06,780
for the four presidents for, you know,

1941
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:10,620
JFK, LBJ, Nixon and Ford

1942
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:13,100
and did various other amazing things

1943
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:16,060
just in a kind of, you know, prosaic governmental context.

1944
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:19,700
But he's also just been dropping bombs on the internet,

1945
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:22,940
saying all sorts of really interesting stuff around,

1946
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:24,860
you know, his investigations of,

1947
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:27,500
you know, he says that he meets Lawrence P. Geiss,

1948
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:30,740
who's, you know, Jeff Bezos' maternal grandfather

1949
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:32,460
by adoption, who runs, you know,

1950
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,780
the Atomic Energy Commission's Albuquerque branch.

1951
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,740
And, you know, he's sort of briefed on, you know, UFOs

1952
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:41,100
and that there was a UFO that came out of this, you know,

1953
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:45,260
Bluegill triple prime tests from the Marshall Islands tests.

1954
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:47,460
And so, you know, you spent some time with him.

1955
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,420
Did you learn anything interesting

1956
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,300
by just being around him?

1957
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,260
And did you find it, yeah, did you find it credible?

1958
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:55,100
Oh, yes.

1959
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:58,500
I mean, that I can start with for sure, for like 100%.

1960
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:00,820
Like, yeah, he is like a living legend.

1961
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:03,300
He's probably done more for America

1962
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,300
than like anyone I've ever met, right?

1963
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,740
Just in terms of just the duration of service,

1964
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:11,460
as well as just the level of impact, right?

1965
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:12,860
Like holding Curtis Lemme back

1966
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,940
from potentially nuking during the Cuban-Military crisis.

1967
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:16,780
It's a big deal.

1968
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,260
Big deal, you know, not somebody,

1969
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:21,260
he's not a guy who's gonna like humble brag about that, right?

1970
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:23,060
He just did it when he was like 27.

1971
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:24,540
And it's just part of his, you know,

1972
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:27,300
he's like, he's a quiet kind of civil servant,

1973
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:29,740
sort of technocrat by nature.

1974
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:32,380
So he's never one to kind of pat himself on the shoulder

1975
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:34,460
or kind of, you know, be a braggadocio

1976
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:35,980
about his achievements.

1977
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,460
And he was never title obsessed.

1978
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,860
It was never, he probably could have been

1979
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,300
multiple different cabinet secretary type roles.

1980
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:44,420
And he was never, you know, about the ego.

1981
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:45,860
So I think that's just,

1982
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:46,860
yeah, I think there are people like that.

1983
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:48,300
I'm not sure there's that many people like that,

1984
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,620
but like those are unique, special people.

1985
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:52,140
It's a rare breed, yeah.

1986
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,300
It's a rare breed and it's also why I think

1987
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:56,900
he was trusted by so many different, you know,

1988
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:59,260
presidents and senior leaders over, you know,

1989
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:01,420
many, many years.

1990
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:03,540
And it's why when he says things,

1991
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:07,420
it's from a position of like being in a,

1992
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:11,260
an enduring role,

1993
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,420
an enduring roles where he's given a huge amount of trust

1994
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,860
by multiple presidents.

1995
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:18,180
And he's an enormous cache, enormous reputation.

1996
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:22,180
Like he spent his life serving the national security state,

1997
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:24,580
you know, from the early sort of Cold War,

1998
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:26,620
anti-ballistic missile sort of defense planning,

1999
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:28,020
all the way to like international trade,

2000
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,900
negotiating, you know, trade treaties,

2001
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,780
being the sort of the back channel with the Soviets

2002
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,020
and the Chinese and just, you know,

2003
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,220
playing at the geopolitical level at the highest,

2004
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,100
at the highest, the highest level.

2005
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,540
And so he's got an amazing reputation.

2006
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:42,100
He was a national consultant.

2007
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,860
Like this guy could have just, you know,

2008
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,460
could sail off into the sunset,

2009
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,660
never say a word about UAPs.

2010
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,620
And, you know, his name would be in the history books.

2011
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:50,460
He's written books.

2012
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:53,380
His legacy would be secured.

2013
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,700
And the fact that he's, you know,

2014
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:59,260
very insistent on bringing his thoughts to the public

2015
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:02,380
and his historical interactions with these, you know,

2016
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,740
important figures in the early Cold War

2017
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:06,620
on the subject of UAPs explicitly

2018
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:10,060
and non-human intelligence and UFOs is a remarkable thing.

2019
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,260
Like this guy has nothing to gain

2020
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:14,060
about talking about this stuff.

2021
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,700
And he could be enjoying, you know,

2022
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,820
retirement and just chilling out, right?

2023
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:21,900
The fact that he is very focused

2024
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:24,180
on trying to bring some of his knowledge

2025
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:26,940
and his experiences to the public,

2026
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,540
I think should draw attention, right?

2027
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:31,620
Should have people perk up and take notice.

2028
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,340
Yeah, and he has these, you know,

2029
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:39,340
arresting, you know, anecdotes about talking with,

2030
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,500
yeah, Lawrence P. Geiss,

2031
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:44,740
who told him the like of their efforts to retrieve UFOs

2032
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:49,740
out at, you know, around Los Alamos.

2033
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,980
And similar with Richard Bissell,

2034
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,660
who told him of their efforts to retrieve

2035
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:55,700
and figure out other world technologies.

2036
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,580
And Richard Bissell was number two at the CIA

2037
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:01,900
and helped form Area 51 and was kind of like,

2038
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:03,980
I think CIA liaison to Skunk Works

2039
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,340
because they were doing a lot of work together.

2040
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:08,020
Yeah, and then, you know,

2041
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:12,060
Harold has been a trusted confidant to multiple presidents,

2042
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,700
you know, helped, you know.

2043
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,860
And I think there's an interesting part of that

2044
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:17,900
Cold War history, especially under Kennedy,

2045
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,900
which, you know, who knows?

2046
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,420
We'll see, we'll get more information

2047
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:24,260
on those Kennedy-related records.

2048
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,740
Yeah.

2049
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:27,380
Which, interesting sidebar,

2050
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,380
I found it noteworthy and people should go back

2051
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:31,660
to the Joe Rogan interview with Donald Trump,

2052
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:32,820
where Joe Rogan is talking to him

2053
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:34,540
about the Kennedy assassination records

2054
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:36,660
and, you know, prompting him to commit

2055
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:39,620
to whatever disclosures of those records, et cetera.

2056
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:43,460
And then Trump leads the transition of the conversation

2057
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:46,580
from, like, Rogan talking about JFK records

2058
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,260
and how many people are interested in them.

2059
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:50,700
And then Rogan goes, and then Trump goes,

2060
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,020
many people are also interested in

2061
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,020
the people coming from space.

2062
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:55,820
And he looks up at the ceiling.

2063
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:58,660
And then Rogan, who's like, huh, goes,

2064
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,940
like, you know about that?

2065
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:01,460
And Trump, with a somber look, goes,

2066
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:03,260
I know a lot about that, a ton.

2067
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:06,060
And then Rogan tries to prompt him.

2068
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,340
And, you know, Trump kind of, I think, realizes

2069
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,580
he's kind of said too much.

2070
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:10,900
And then he sort of pivots to talking about

2071
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,580
how Area 51's a tourist destination

2072
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:14,420
and the most beautiful pilots come to him

2073
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:16,140
and talk about seeing anomalous things.

2074
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,100
Pilots with crew cuts.

2075
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,460
Yeah, crew cuts, the most beautiful,

2076
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:21,340
the most handsome pilots, the greatest pilots,

2077
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:23,980
the greatest tourist, you know,

2078
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:26,700
secret research projects in the desert.

2079
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,940
What do you think Trump knows?

2080
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:31,460
Well, that was a fast, so I think he said,

2081
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,500
many people are interested in the people coming from space

2082
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,780
and he looked up.

2083
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:37,900
And then he sort of, I think he tried to walk this back

2084
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,380
because I've never been a believer, you know,

2085
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,100
he sort of tried to dial it back.

2086
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,660
But that was an odd turn of phrase for a president to use.

2087
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:48,180
And immediately after, like without any, like, you know,

2088
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,980
apparent prompting by Rogan, like in his brain,

2089
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,540
there's a bunch of neurons that have JFK, you know,

2090
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,460
associations and apparently those neurons

2091
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:58,260
are like really close to his UFO neurons

2092
01:20:58,260 --> 01:20:59,500
and they just fired.

2093
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,780
And they sort of, you know, in his free association,

2094
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:04,140
the UFO subject is just close, you know,

2095
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:07,420
in his cognitive matrix to JFK.

2096
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,940
So that, if you're trying to like, what does Trump know?

2097
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:11,900
Well, that's telling me like what sorts of concepts

2098
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,860
and memories are embedded in his prefrontal cortex

2099
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:15,420
and his amygdala and whatever, right?

2100
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,860
Or his hippocampus actually.

2101
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,820
And it seems like through his verbal utterances

2102
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:24,300
that JFK and UFOs or specifically people coming from space

2103
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,580
are connected in his mental relationships, right?

2104
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:30,100
Can you fathom as to what that relationship

2105
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,780
might be in Trump's mind?

2106
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:33,980
Well, that is a really interesting question.

2107
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:36,860
And this is where I know those folks like Jeff Cruickshank

2108
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:41,220
have done like the forensic historical kind of deep dive,

2109
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:45,220
look through the Kennedy archives, like the library,

2110
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:49,140
kind of, you know, records, the declassified JFK records,

2111
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:49,980
which are, you know,

2112
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,780
obviously historical vertical material.

2113
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,620
And then you have these much more contested materials

2114
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:58,860
like the MJ-12 documents, which, you know, are enormous

2115
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:00,780
and, you know, highly disputed.

2116
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,900
But you can find these interesting correlations

2117
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:06,100
between say calendar, you know, entries and diary entries

2118
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:07,860
and some interesting overlaps there.

2119
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,500
Jeff is obviously much more tuned to those details,

2120
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,220
but they overlap with this sort of period of time

2121
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,740
where there's a lot of just immense.

2122
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,540
And we talked about this in the first interview

2123
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:18,380
of just like that period

2124
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,940
is there was a certain power structure in place in the US,

2125
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:21,780
right?

2126
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:22,600
There was extremely like, you know,

2127
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:23,900
go back to the Fukuyama institutional lot,

2128
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:26,660
sort of like these guys were climbing to the peak

2129
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:29,780
of that kind of institutional creation, energy, power,

2130
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:31,700
the Dulles brothers, you know,

2131
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,460
kind of this whole system, right?

2132
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:35,060
That kind of won World War II

2133
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:38,020
and then created this post-war architecture.

2134
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:40,660
And then allegedly had access to these advanced materials.

2135
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,820
Like at the sort of, that was the core

2136
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:46,300
of this kind of potential strategic advantage

2137
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,260
they wanted to amplify.

2138
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:50,140
And they were a small group, right?

2139
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:52,260
They weren't like, and they thought of themselves

2140
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:55,500
as like the guardians of American, you know,

2141
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:56,820
strategic interests.

2142
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:59,740
Like democracy was kind of a second order concern

2143
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:00,580
for them, right?

2144
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:03,340
There were higher order strategic considerations

2145
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:07,340
for ensuring that America dominated the global system.

2146
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:08,940
That was what was in their interest

2147
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:11,300
and their institutional interests, that was their focus.

2148
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:14,420
And to the extent that if Kennedy was threatening that,

2149
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:16,700
that would be a challenge to that power structure.

2150
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,500
And, you know, that's the allegation

2151
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,780
is that the power structure, you know, retaliated.

2152
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:25,460
And that's, yeah, we'll see if we get information on that,

2153
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:26,700
but like there seems to have been

2154
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:29,940
this sort of increasing arrows pointing in that direction.

2155
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:32,460
And so you're just implying that that power structure

2156
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:35,100
in the world in which the UFO thing is real

2157
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:37,540
and there's a lineage of, you know, government relationship

2158
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:40,140
with that UFO, you know, phenomena,

2159
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:41,780
it would probably be that power structure

2160
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:45,740
that would kind of hold the keys, so to speak.

2161
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:47,500
It's like, there weren't that many presidents

2162
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,140
that you could say were like independent of the system.

2163
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:52,500
And here comes Kennedy, who's this kind of, you know,

2164
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,540
darling media guy, he's, you know, pretty boy.

2165
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,220
Who the power structure, right?

2166
01:23:58,220 --> 01:23:59,980
If you want to use the general term to refer

2167
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,700
to a whole constellation of different actors.

2168
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:04,180
And institutions at the time that, you know,

2169
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,980
wielded influence and dominated American politics

2170
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,940
and our economy and the global system,

2171
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:11,420
you know, thought that essentially his daddy

2172
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,740
got him the presidency, there was a deal made,

2173
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:15,100
the mafia, the sort of, you know,

2174
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:17,060
the machine in Chicago, et cetera.

2175
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:20,060
And that, you know, if there was a basic,

2176
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:23,500
implicit understanding that the president was there

2177
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,620
to serve a certain set of interests,

2178
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:27,220
and that if you deviate from those interests,

2179
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:30,620
well, they essentially, you're betraying the deal, right?

2180
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:34,060
And if you go too far, say to do a detente

2181
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:37,700
or denuclearization or even cooperation on space

2182
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:40,780
and these alleged potential UFO technologies,

2183
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:42,820
well, that would cut straight to the core

2184
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:44,900
of that apparent deal, essentially.

2185
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:47,220
Oh, you reneged, like deals off,

2186
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,940
you don't get to be president anymore.

2187
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,740
That seems like conspiracy theory,

2188
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:54,420
but like that seems like, like more and more

2189
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:55,980
of the evidence seems to be pointing in that direction.

2190
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:58,460
It's plausible if you look at the historical record

2191
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:02,420
that seems, you know, and that might be part of what,

2192
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:06,740
you know, the reason why like Trump had this embedded

2193
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:09,460
in his brain is like JFK and UFOs are linked,

2194
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:12,700
is that, yeah, that might be part of it,

2195
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,260
that there are records apparently

2196
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:17,700
that would link those two things.

2197
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:20,540
Yeah, so let's touch on the, Jeff Crookshank

2198
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:23,100
is this Australian intelligence officer,

2199
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:26,260
and he's reviewed the footage from these Johnston Atoll,

2200
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:30,140
also Marshall Island's tests, specifically of these,

2201
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:34,300
I think ICBM, it was actually defensive interceptors,

2202
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:37,340
and they were, they had X-rays in the nose cones,

2203
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:40,780
and, you know, one went off, I think it was around,

2204
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:42,900
it was October of 1962,

2205
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,700
I think it was around the Cuban Missile Crisis.

2206
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:45,980
Yeah, November, yeah.

2207
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:46,820
Maybe it was November.

2208
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:47,780
Yeah, I think it was directly after.

2209
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:50,420
And it was, it was at midnight and the thing goes off,

2210
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:54,580
and out of the plume, you see this material like tumble out,

2211
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:57,220
and there's a video of this that you can see today,

2212
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:00,420
and then there's also a video of that, you know,

2213
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:02,980
material tumbling out being superimposed

2214
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:05,220
with a white triangle, sanitized,

2215
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:06,820
and so he's done this deep dive

2216
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:10,620
where he shows that Harold Malmgren actually ends up,

2217
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:15,620
you know, in Los Alamos getting debriefed by Lawrence Geese,

2218
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:17,900
who's the, you know, Atomic Energy Commission's

2219
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:20,860
Albuquerque director, and then a month later,

2220
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:23,460
you have JFK come out himself,

2221
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:26,260
and so that's not really that normal for JFK

2222
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:29,300
to come just check on this, you know, it is Los Alamos,

2223
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:32,500
but it's like, why would you go out and visit?

2224
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,660
And so, you know, maybe, you know,

2225
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:37,780
if Malmgren's saying that he's learning about UFOs

2226
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:40,820
from Lawrence Geese, presumably, you know,

2227
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:43,300
the guy he's advising, the President of the United States,

2228
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:47,060
is coming, you know, that timing is not a coincidence,

2229
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,980
and JFK's probably learning about the UFO question as well,

2230
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:53,140
and then the other piece of evidence is you have,

2231
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:54,460
you know, Howard Hunt is?

2232
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:57,660
Yeah, he's the sort of CIA, you know, wetworks guy.

2233
01:26:57,660 --> 01:27:00,260
Yeah, wetworks guy, agent provocateur,

2234
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:02,540
and like all but admitted he was like involved

2235
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:05,940
in the JFK assassination and a whole host of other things,

2236
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:07,780
but like, you know, wouldn't implicate Dulles

2237
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:09,580
because he was, you know, so quote unquote,

2238
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:12,660
loyal or whatever, and his lawyer,

2239
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,700
I think is a guy named Douglas Caddy,

2240
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:17,180
and Douglas Caddy in an interview says that,

2241
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:19,900
you know, he would persistently question Howard Hunt,

2242
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:22,220
like what was, why did they actually take out JFK?

2243
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:23,900
Why did they take out JFK?

2244
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:27,020
And at the end of that questioning,

2245
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:29,620
Howard Hunt says it was the alien presence,

2246
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,620
and so what do you think?

2247
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:34,420
I mean, well, and yeah, I think even Harold has tweeted,

2248
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:37,580
you know, you always got to have notifications on for Harold.

2249
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:39,220
You know, he just drops these things,

2250
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:41,300
he's just like, here you go.

2251
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,420
And yeah, I think he explicitly referenced

2252
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:47,460
how he had gotten reports from the triple prime test,

2253
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:50,700
which, yeah, I believe it was the gold encased.

2254
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:51,940
They took a lot of gold out of Fort Knox

2255
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:54,700
and they just basically put it around this nuke to do the,

2256
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:55,580
I think it's Bram Shillung,

2257
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:58,020
or basically generates a sort of X-ray burst,

2258
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:00,740
which, you know, amplifies the ability

2259
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:03,540
to essentially fry the incoming ballistic missile.

2260
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:08,100
And apparently got reports of this object

2261
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:10,860
that had fallen out and was retrieved by the Navy,

2262
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:14,660
and then Harold, like, requested more information

2263
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:16,300
and was denied that,

2264
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:19,380
and then goes out to Albuquerque to get ground truth.

2265
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:21,420
And then a month later, roughly, I think,

2266
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:24,940
JFK goes on his first visit to that same lab, essentially.

2267
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:27,660
It looks like he was doing the advanced, you know,

2268
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:30,580
wait, we're not getting the full story here in Washington.

2269
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:32,620
Like, Harold, you're my guy on the ground,

2270
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:35,060
like, figure out what's really going on here, right?

2271
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,020
And at the time, there was a lot of inter-service rivalries,

2272
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:39,500
I think, between these different,

2273
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,900
you know, branches of the military,

2274
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,940
which, you know, I think Curtis LeMay

2275
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:46,660
had his own vision for, like, nuclear everything, right?

2276
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:49,380
He had, like, crazy plans for some doomsday weapons

2277
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:51,620
and just he wanted to go whole hog, right?

2278
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:54,420
And he had, you know, and he had his whole power base

2279
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:56,420
and the Navy, you know, wanted to have their own power base

2280
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:57,380
and so they would have an incentive

2281
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:59,060
to kind of hold this as their trump card.

2282
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:00,740
So I think there's a lot of institutional rivalry

2283
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:01,900
and, of course, the Atomic Energy Commission,

2284
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:04,020
Division of Military Applications, Geiss,

2285
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:05,860
was there to kind of be the main belly button

2286
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:07,500
on all things nuclear and the military,

2287
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,820
but, like, more fundamental research.

2288
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,660
So they would ultimately be the,

2289
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:12,500
and I think Rush has alluded to this, too,

2290
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,940
like, they would be the ultimate custodians

2291
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:17,740
for any sort of R&D effort, right?

2292
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:19,500
But there's probably a complicated bargaining position

2293
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,100
between these different services

2294
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,700
and the Atomic Energy Commission.

2295
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,580
But, yeah, I think this is part,

2296
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:26,940
points to a part of American history

2297
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:29,300
where these, you know, very, very, you know,

2298
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:32,380
conspiratorial, sort of, conspiracy fodder material

2299
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:34,500
is all tied together in a tight knot.

2300
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:40,260
And here we are, you know, coming up 70 years,

2301
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:43,740
80 years later and it's, like, still, like, a pressing matter.

2302
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:44,940
Yeah. Like, what happened?

2303
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:45,900
Yeah.

2304
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:48,460
And who knows, like, Trump has signed this executive order

2305
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:50,940
to get a plan written in the next, like, week or so

2306
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:54,220
to disclose more JFK records.

2307
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:55,900
Tulsi Gabbard, on her testimony,

2308
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:57,860
says she's going to be focused on that,

2309
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:00,100
as well as the anomalous health incidents stuff.

2310
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:02,700
Again, with any topic, you can try to address it

2311
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:05,740
from the question of what should have been your prior

2312
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:08,300
for that type of thing, and then what is now your posterior

2313
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:10,460
for that sort of thing, given a historical, you know,

2314
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:11,980
testimonial evidence.

2315
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:13,220
It's always better to start with a prior.

2316
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:16,740
And it's funny, like, if I, like, you know,

2317
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:19,820
introspect on my priors for this broader topic,

2318
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:23,020
I actually think my naive prior for the reality

2319
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:26,220
of, say, psi abilities should have been,

2320
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:27,940
I don't think I actually did this, you know,

2321
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:29,940
baseline assessment before I was forced to now,

2322
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:32,540
like, create a posterior belief.

2323
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:35,140
But it's like, I think my prior for the reality

2324
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:38,060
of psi phenomenon should be higher,

2325
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:41,180
given my metaphysical sort of commitments

2326
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:43,460
to something like protopanpsychism

2327
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:45,020
as an integrated metaphysics

2328
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:47,300
underlying a certain theory of physics,

2329
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:50,420
than the prior for the reality of non-human intelligence

2330
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:51,820
coming from another star system.

2331
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:53,780
Because to motivate that prior, I have to account

2332
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:58,100
for a whole bunch of, you know, interrelated hypotheses

2333
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:02,500
in my model about the processes of intelligence

2334
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,820
and the history of 13.7 billion years of the universe

2335
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:06,900
and the number of star systems that are nearby,

2336
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:09,020
potentially panspermia in a, you know,

2337
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:12,580
a local ring around the galaxy of maybe 10,000 stars

2338
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:14,060
that were all together in a stellar nursery.

2339
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:16,060
And we had, you know, asteroid bombardments

2340
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,620
and so there's maybe like, you know,

2341
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:19,820
a one in a thousand chance that like,

2342
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:21,980
there's an advanced sibling system to us

2343
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:24,140
that was like, you know, born around the same time

2344
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:27,060
that gave us, you know, primitive genetic material,

2345
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:28,940
but, you know, was correlated then

2346
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:31,100
to our proximate neighborhood in the universe

2347
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,180
and would also have a reason to engage with us.

2348
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:35,500
And our cosmological models themselves

2349
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,580
are just patchwork upon patchwork.

2350
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:39,700
Like, there's like a scaling problem

2351
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:41,980
of your physical model of reality.

2352
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:44,580
And so like, if you get, it's like a, you know, rocket

2353
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:46,300
that's like two degrees off course,

2354
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,820
you end up like, you know, 99 degrees off course very soon.

2355
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:52,420
And I think that's basically like our understanding

2356
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:55,500
of like Cartesian space, you know, and like, you know,

2357
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,980
space overall and the planets and stuff.

2358
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:00,580
It's pretty shaky and it's very recent.

2359
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,780
Yeah, I guess my larger point was,

2360
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:04,940
I think if you just ask the average person on the street,

2361
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:06,860
what's more likely, aliens are visiting us

2362
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:08,460
or psychics are real.

2363
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:10,020
I think people would go, well, they're both crazy,

2364
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:12,380
but I think aliens are probably more likely to be real

2365
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:14,980
but I think that's purely just an availability bias.

2366
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:17,380
No, the psychic thing is there's so much more evidence

2367
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:18,220
like you're saying.

2368
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:19,060
Yeah, but it's just an availability bias

2369
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:22,100
because of what sorts of media narratives we have.

2370
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:24,620
We've seen a lot more alien movies than some psychic movies.

2371
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:25,460
That's right.

2372
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:27,420
And so people just think, oh, well, you know,

2373
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:29,620
the only ambient facts I have to form that prior

2374
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:31,460
if you ask me that question is,

2375
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:33,380
it seems like aliens are a thing that people talk about

2376
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:34,540
and it's in the movies all the time.

2377
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:36,500
And yeah, like the universe is big,

2378
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,300
but like I've never read anybody's mind.

2379
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,940
I've never had my mind read that I can think of

2380
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:41,300
or I never moved an object with my head.

2381
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:42,820
That seems, you know.

2382
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:43,860
And then the funny thing is,

2383
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:45,740
I think if they were to truly audit themselves,

2384
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:47,340
they'd be like, there was that one time

2385
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:49,460
I kind of read somebody's mind, but.

2386
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:50,780
Well, and in a certain sense,

2387
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:53,180
most people's folk metaphysics is physicalism, right?

2388
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,780
Which is essentially, you know,

2389
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:56,820
a branch of that would be the computational functionalism

2390
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:58,620
of, you know, Dennett and Churchland,

2391
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:00,580
which is just almost at a metaphysical level

2392
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:02,140
eliminates the reality of consciousness.

2393
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:03,940
Therefore the basic idea that then there can be

2394
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:06,500
other degrees of freedom in reality associated

2395
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:09,700
with just pure consciousness as a phenomenon

2396
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:12,580
is just ruled out, like by assumption, right?

2397
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:16,060
In your model of metaphysics, that's just not a thing, right?

2398
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:18,060
And so anyone claiming that to be a thing

2399
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:20,460
is just like, it's not an empirical question

2400
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:21,660
of I need to look out into the world

2401
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:23,020
to see is this a thing that's true.

2402
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:25,740
It's ruled out by my metaphysical assumptions, right?

2403
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:27,980
Therefore it must be absurd to even claim such a thing.

2404
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:30,140
So you need to, that question forces you then

2405
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:31,620
to inspect your metaphysical commitments

2406
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:32,900
about the nature of consciousness.

2407
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:35,900
Whereas the question of aliens is, you know,

2408
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:36,940
people that are physicalists,

2409
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:39,340
computational functionalism, you know, adherence.

2410
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,300
It's way easier to then motivate, oh, well, yeah,

2411
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,860
like we exist, like we create rockets.

2412
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:46,540
Somebody else could exist and create rockets.

2413
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:48,500
There's no metaphysical question at issue there.

2414
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,780
There's just a question of time and complexity

2415
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:52,900
and propulsion systems and, you know,

2416
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:55,100
the probabilities associated with star systems

2417
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:57,780
that could, you know, incubate life,

2418
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,620
interacting with each other on time scales

2419
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:00,900
relevant to our civilization.

2420
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:03,940
So that's somewhat of a scientifically grounded question.

2421
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:06,420
And this is why the UAP question, the Jake Barber story

2422
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:08,100
is very confronting to a lot of people

2423
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:11,060
because it forces you to really intellectually

2424
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:13,900
and very seriously engage at this metaphysical layer

2425
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:17,100
that even most people in a lot of the, say,

2426
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:20,980
like the semi-serious professional commentariat on UAPs

2427
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:23,220
that take the story of anomalous UAP objects

2428
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,580
very seriously, you know, button themselves up

2429
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:27,660
as being, you know, sober journalists

2430
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,900
or rational people who inspect the evidence

2431
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:31,460
and look at, you know, government reports.

2432
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:33,540
And, you know, they go, oh, well,

2433
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:35,540
there's lots of evidence that we have anomalies,

2434
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:37,940
but it could be hypotheses X, Y, and Z.

2435
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:39,900
But the size stuff, oh, that's off the table.

2436
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:41,300
That's crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2437
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:42,340
And it's like, well, that's not really

2438
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:43,660
a rational approach, right?

2439
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:44,900
Because a rational person starts

2440
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:46,300
with their metaphysical assumptions

2441
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:47,380
and then builds up from there.

2442
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:51,020
I was into the size stuff before I got into UFOs, so.

2443
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,380
I mean, winding roads.

2444
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:53,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2445
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:57,140
But that's your other point about, you know,

2446
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:58,620
how do we have certainty on any of this?

2447
01:34:58,620 --> 01:34:59,460
We really don't, right?

2448
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:02,100
We're always trying to hold together a lot

2449
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,860
of what amounts to very noisy

2450
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:06,500
and hard to anchor together pieces of information.

2451
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:10,140
It's why the OAP subject is like human science

2452
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:12,740
and culture and sort of our pictures of the world

2453
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:15,380
have evolved, at least to first word,

2454
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:17,300
on an incremental basis over our history.

2455
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,580
Like, we've just been going through this,

2456
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:22,140
like maybe there's been a hidden hand seeding some things

2457
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:24,340
or downloading people or whoever is,

2458
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:26,340
maybe there's a second order process

2459
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:28,340
that's sort of guiding human social

2460
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:31,140
and, you know, our scientific organizations over time.

2461
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:33,100
But, I mean, you could just look at history

2462
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:35,340
and it's not obvious there was like a, you know,

2463
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,740
there's lots of inspirational moments and big geniuses,

2464
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:39,380
but there was a tower of knowledge

2465
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:41,740
that took a lot of time and effort to create.

2466
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:44,380
And it was like difficult experiments,

2467
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:46,060
some smart person noticing something

2468
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:49,380
and then being like, huh, like Galileo with the telescope

2469
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:51,860
or, you know, Newton and figuring out,

2470
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,380
okay, we can use calculus to look at these,

2471
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:57,300
you know, the sort of planetary sort of observations

2472
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:00,500
and basic tricks of, oh, we formalize knowledge with math

2473
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,620
and then we construct experimental apparatuses.

2474
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:03,860
This is the enlightenment project

2475
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:06,180
and that's what we've built civilization on.

2476
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:07,620
And the thing about the UAP question,

2477
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:10,820
it's like, if it turns out that all of a sudden,

2478
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:13,540
since maybe the 30s or 40s, you know,

2479
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:16,340
allegedly we got some material magenta crash

2480
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:19,060
into the post-war era is when we got subsumed

2481
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:23,020
to these larger systematic industrial academic bureaucracies

2482
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:23,900
and there were hypercharges,

2483
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:26,580
our civilization got, you know, more and more technology.

2484
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:30,860
It's like, oh, okay, you've got this potential accelerant,

2485
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,340
right, but it's like a nonlinear thing.

2486
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:35,780
You've got access to craft and beings potentially.

2487
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:38,060
That's just like a nonlinear, like,

2488
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:40,220
we don't have the systems, like our systems of knowledge

2489
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:45,020
have not been built to like, to deal with that, right?

2490
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:47,980
It's like this lump, right?

2491
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:50,140
And we've been trying to maybe absorb it or chip away at,

2492
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:51,500
but it's probably just this rock sitting

2493
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:53,340
in the middle of the snake.

2494
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:56,060
You know what I worry about a little bit

2495
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:59,260
is the idea that in the 40s and 50s,

2496
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:00,660
the US government's stand,

2497
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:03,780
these aerospace prob contractors started to fuck around

2498
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:08,660
with this stuff and they couldn't get it to work.

2499
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:10,660
And it's been this sort of like really hard,

2500
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:15,340
cumbersome process, you know, from then till now.

2501
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:18,700
And we were never supposed to have it in the first place.

2502
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:22,060
And whatever beings exist on the other side of this,

2503
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:24,100
you know, I don't know if you saw this Jason Sands,

2504
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:26,660
one of these whistleblowers who was, I guess,

2505
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:29,420
part of the counter Intel was, you know,

2506
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:31,220
perimeter security for the program.

2507
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:33,300
And he sort of saw this like blue alien being

2508
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:34,980
at Nellis testing range in Nevada.

2509
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:36,980
And he was a part of James Fox's, the program.

2510
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:38,620
He just went on Joe Rogan.

2511
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:40,860
And I think that maybe the most important part

2512
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:44,620
of that interview, he says, they want their stuff back

2513
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:46,580
and they're gonna kill everybody involved in the program

2514
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:48,060
if they don't get it.

2515
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:50,140
And that's pretty freaky.

2516
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:52,780
And so, again, I have no mental model

2517
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:54,420
or understanding of any of this stuff,

2518
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:56,620
but like, what if we weren't supposed to have it

2519
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:57,620
in the first place?

2520
01:37:57,620 --> 01:38:02,300
And what if, you know, they're gonna come back for it?

2521
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:04,820
Again, it's one of these hypotheticals.

2522
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:07,500
It's hard to know like what to deal with it.

2523
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:08,460
But I do find it interesting.

2524
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:10,780
It's like people, like the legacy,

2525
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:12,620
you say that like we use the term legacy program

2526
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:14,020
and it's now become like this term of art.

2527
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:15,820
But what we're sort of referring to is

2528
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:17,220
like a particular pathology

2529
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:20,180
in a modern state institutional structure, right?

2530
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:22,740
That it maybe became pathological as a result

2531
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:25,820
of coming into possession of some of these materials.

2532
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:27,620
And then the sort of, you know,

2533
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:29,420
some threads of knowledge

2534
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:31,980
that were sort of teased out of it, right?

2535
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:34,540
That maybe the psionics knowledge

2536
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,620
or maybe inspirations in meta materials

2537
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:38,020
or novel propulsion systems

2538
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:40,340
and potential weapons that could be created.

2539
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:43,020
And that like hyper pathologized

2540
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:46,060
a portion of our military intelligence system

2541
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:47,500
that essentially delaminated.

2542
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,940
We talked about this in our first interview

2543
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:51,940
and it sort of delaminated and it kind of,

2544
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:54,540
it's like the ring of power golem, right?

2545
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:57,100
It's like starts off as happy, you know,

2546
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:59,580
well adjusted creature.

2547
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:02,300
And then as a result of having access to this, you know,

2548
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:03,860
totem, this sort of, you know,

2549
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:05,420
this metaphysical object almost

2550
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:08,860
of super advanced capabilities,

2551
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:12,820
it completely distorts them into this golem institution,

2552
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:13,660
right?

2553
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:15,420
So it's like the rings of power,

2554
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:17,580
that's what they do, right?

2555
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:20,260
And it's an interesting counterfactual of like.

2556
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:24,100
And passing the test is never taking up the ring

2557
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:27,260
and thinking that you are above the corruption of it.

2558
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:31,220
It is just not holding the ring, not putting the ring on.

2559
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:32,740
That is the test.

2560
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:34,980
Well, this is, well, again, this is where I'm,

2561
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:37,820
again, I always weigh these antinomies of like,

2562
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:40,700
you could go that direction,

2563
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:41,820
but if you take that logic,

2564
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:45,220
then it's like all of technology system

2565
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:46,660
was like the Kaczynski thesis.

2566
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:47,900
It's like technology is inherently

2567
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:49,460
corrupting for civilization.

2568
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:51,980
Man in a modern technological civilization

2569
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:54,940
is a contorted, distorted, pathologized,

2570
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:58,380
exploited version of, it's like,

2571
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:00,020
we've all become golems,

2572
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:01,420
regardless of alien technology

2573
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:03,380
from a certain philosophical standpoint.

2574
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:05,620
And therefore to de-golemize humanity,

2575
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:08,740
we need to return to a much more agrarian,

2576
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:10,340
primitive state of nature.

2577
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:11,820
Some people can make an argument for that,

2578
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:14,380
but like, you're gonna give up a lot along the way.

2579
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:16,060
Yeah, I don't believe that.

2580
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:17,380
So for me, it's a spectrum.

2581
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:18,900
It's not like a binary.

2582
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:20,940
And like, for example, hypotheticals,

2583
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:23,340
think about some of the more very different institutions

2584
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:26,300
that humans have created over the world or over world history.

2585
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:29,980
Say, Socrates, Plato's, Agora,

2586
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:34,060
or high councils of scholarship

2587
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:37,860
in the scholastic era in medieval Europe,

2588
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:42,860
enlightened, or circles of sort of Buddhas,

2589
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:46,460
sort of inheritors, people that were committed

2590
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:49,980
to spiritual transformation, intellectual scholarship.

2591
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:52,260
They weren't connected to war fighting institutions

2592
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:56,460
and state bureaucracies, or sort of financial institutions

2593
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:59,700
associated with some sort of elite network.

2594
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:02,300
Their institution was focused on knowledge,

2595
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:05,260
wisdom, higher purposes.

2596
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:08,980
If you had systems of sort of secrecy

2597
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:12,620
and reverse engineering that were guided by those people,

2598
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:15,540
would you get the same sort of blue beings being like,

2599
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:17,780
I'm not dealing with those murderers and barbarians

2600
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,420
on the other side of the hill, right?

2601
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:22,740
And I think that's the binary 51 that Sands alleged,

2602
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:25,100
was you get a much more enlightened interrelationship

2603
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:28,380
between, hey, this is a really interesting technology.

2604
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:31,620
We would love to use this to further our civilization

2605
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:35,660
and bring humanity to a much higher plane of being

2606
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:38,260
and fulfillment and flourishing.

2607
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:41,660
Instead of creating platforms for nukes, right?

2608
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:42,500
I believe that.

2609
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:45,820
I think Seek and Ye shall find and fuck around

2610
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:46,660
and you'll find out.

2611
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:51,020
If you cut to the core of the parapsychological stuff,

2612
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:53,500
you can instantiate it in its most primitive form

2613
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,780
in this random event generator experiment.

2614
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:58,380
And it's just basically the random event generators,

2615
01:41:58,380 --> 01:41:59,420
how much can you affect

2616
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:01,940
a random quantum mechanical process, right?

2617
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:05,740
And the more heart-centered and aligned you are,

2618
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:08,100
the more you can, and I don't think you can fake that.

2619
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:10,500
So you can create a program around trying to get people

2620
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:12,380
quote unquote more heart-centered,

2621
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:16,540
but your meta objective is to weaponize all this shit

2622
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:18,340
and to be a billionaire or whatever.

2623
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:19,500
It's just not gonna work.

2624
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,540
It's gonna fail on you in the end.

2625
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:24,140
And so you can lie to a bunch of people about it

2626
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:28,060
and it'll be the myth of Faust or Prometheus

2627
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:29,460
and you'll blow up.

2628
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:33,180
And so I do really believe what you just said,

2629
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:36,380
which is if you really want the good stuff to happen,

2630
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:39,420
you actually do have to look within and change yourself.

2631
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:42,180
If you're buying into this sort of model,

2632
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:45,140
the parapsychological model where your ability

2633
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:50,140
to render reality is commensurate with some sort of,

2634
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:52,180
again, this is really loose,

2635
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:56,220
but internal coherence or growth or whatever.

2636
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:59,900
And you can't really operationalize that locally,

2637
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:03,820
but for some kind of dystopian objective,

2638
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:04,660
it's just not gonna work.

2639
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:07,340
So let me throw a hypothetical at you, right?

2640
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:12,340
This is the, let's say, I'll create an SAT analogy here,

2641
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:16,700
is like exercise and diet is too ozempic

2642
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:21,220
as alien, say, psionic-inspired practices

2643
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:24,980
is to like Buddhist asceticism, right?

2644
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:28,380
It's like, is this a shortcut?

2645
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:29,860
Is this a cheat?

2646
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:33,220
Yeah, the point is there are no shortcuts.

2647
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:35,340
Like in this model, there are no shortcuts.

2648
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:39,020
So yeah, you're shutting down your pancreas of, you know.

2649
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:40,100
Yeah, like the ozempic,

2650
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:42,340
it gets you what you thought was an outcome,

2651
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:45,300
but there are side effects that accrue

2652
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:48,660
that essentially undermine the value of that outcome

2653
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:49,620
that you thought you were aiming for.

2654
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:50,860
That's right, yeah, yeah.

2655
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:53,820
No, I think that is a good analogy

2656
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:56,620
with higher cost on the UAP side

2657
01:43:56,620 --> 01:44:00,220
than, you know, whatever organs malfunction due to ozempic.

2658
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:01,060
But yeah.

2659
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:03,540
But then it's like maybe, again, this is where I stress,

2660
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:06,460
and again, this is almost like the sky watcher thing is like,

2661
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:08,540
this is the inherent tension is like,

2662
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:13,380
there's a certain folks like you

2663
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:15,620
that have been paying close attention to this,

2664
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:18,260
have gone down, again, this variety of rabbit holes

2665
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:20,420
and come to this realization that it is,

2666
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:23,260
that is you need to sort of have this self-reflective

2667
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:26,860
orientation that there's no one weird trick

2668
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:29,740
or shortcut to enlightenment or whatever.

2669
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:31,060
But the average person doesn't even know

2670
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:34,300
that that's even a thing that they should like care about.

2671
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:37,220
And do you need to have essentially

2672
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:38,620
what amounts to profit motivated

2673
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:43,780
or financed efforts to sort of broaden awareness

2674
01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:47,180
of that thing in and of itself, right?

2675
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:48,660
That stimulates and catalyzes

2676
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:51,580
a much wider swath of humanity too on that journey.

2677
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:53,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2678
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:55,460
But that's almost like, what is disclosure?

2679
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:57,220
Is disclosure just the sort of,

2680
01:44:57,220 --> 01:45:01,100
yes, non-human intelligence is real, like deal with it?

2681
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:06,100
Or is it a, hey, there are now veridical clues

2682
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:08,100
about the structure of reality

2683
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:09,660
and the nature of human consciousness

2684
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:12,100
that everyone needs to be aware of

2685
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:16,300
in order to pursue their existence in the world

2686
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:18,740
in a way that ideally brings more flourishing

2687
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:19,820
and fulfillment, right?

2688
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:22,780
But it unlocks, this is the tension between technology

2689
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:25,140
and pure spiritualism, right?

2690
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:27,940
Is I don't see this as like a binary or as like a trade-off.

2691
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:32,020
Like there are technologies clearly up-leveled humanity

2692
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:34,140
to the point where you and I can have a conversation

2693
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:36,620
on your best that we wouldn't have been having

2694
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:38,980
or be able to get access to knowledge

2695
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:41,460
and social relationships.

2696
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:45,060
And again, kind of personal satisfaction

2697
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:46,660
that would otherwise have not been possible

2698
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:48,780
without the predicates of modern technology.

2699
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:53,220
And so, again, I'm fundamentally maybe I'm a fence-sitter.

2700
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:58,220
It's like, there's always a gray zone of you can go to,

2701
01:45:58,540 --> 01:46:00,420
like the ring of power can always corrupt.

2702
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:03,220
It's like, the question is, is it really a ring of power?

2703
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:06,340
Or is it, like reality ultimately

2704
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:07,700
is just what it is.

2705
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:09,300
And humans are trying to understand it.

2706
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:12,140
And that process of understanding doesn't,

2707
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:14,260
is not guaranteed a good outcome for humanity.

2708
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:16,100
Like we can put our hand in the box

2709
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:18,140
in the, whatever is it, is it Bostrom, right?

2710
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:21,540
It's like, there may be knowledge, dangerous knowledge, right?

2711
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:24,220
Like not all knowledge is just, oh, this is a sunshine.

2712
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:25,060
This is a rainbow.

2713
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:26,780
Oh, this is like forever knowledge.

2714
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:29,060
It's like, this is world destroying knowledge, right?

2715
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:31,340
Like there's no guarantee that the box of knowledge

2716
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:32,660
humanity is dipping its hand into

2717
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:35,580
is gonna be like good knowledge.

2718
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:38,140
Does that mean you stopped dipping your hand in the box?

2719
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:38,980
I don't know.

2720
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:39,820
No, no.

2721
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:43,940
Well, so I think that technology is,

2722
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:44,780
you can't go back.

2723
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:46,620
You can't do the Kaczynski thing.

2724
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:49,660
I think it's a forcing function

2725
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:51,180
and it's a sort of a generic template.

2726
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:53,420
And there's a forcing function in that, like,

2727
01:46:54,460 --> 01:46:58,820
your ability to manifest results in reality

2728
01:46:58,820 --> 01:47:01,540
as a result of the technology is like,

2729
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:04,300
the latency is like, much lower.

2730
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:07,180
And like the multiplicative effect is much higher, right?

2731
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:08,660
Like you can like scale these things.

2732
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:12,700
And so I would just say, you know, like the,

2733
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:15,700
you know, it's like Peter Thiel went on Joe Rogan.

2734
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:17,660
He was like, you know,

2735
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:19,940
these things have to be angels or demons.

2736
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:22,860
It's not that they might be demons or angels.

2737
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:25,020
They must be demons or angels

2738
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:27,300
if you have faster than light travel.

2739
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:30,900
And both of those seem pretty crazy to me.

2740
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:32,660
So I would just say,

2741
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:35,580
if your intention is not like, you know,

2742
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:38,660
updating or, you know, growing or, you know,

2743
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:41,220
being molded in this sort of positive way

2744
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:43,820
and there's not this like introspective feedback loop

2745
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:46,940
commensurate with advancements in technology

2746
01:47:46,940 --> 01:47:48,820
or like putting your hand in the box,

2747
01:47:48,820 --> 01:47:49,860
then you're fucked.

2748
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:51,260
But I don't think, you know,

2749
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:52,580
keeping your hand, you know,

2750
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:54,700
out of the box at all times is like,

2751
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:55,900
that's like the right answer.

2752
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:57,780
So that's the way I would put it.

2753
01:47:57,780 --> 01:47:59,140
And I don't know who's,

2754
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:00,660
I don't think there is a master plan for this,

2755
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:02,340
but I almost think the Psionics thing,

2756
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:04,300
while it's maybe more indigestible

2757
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:05,700
for the media and consumer,

2758
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:09,060
is critical to try to steer

2759
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:11,740
whatever chaotic disclosure path we're on,

2760
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:14,660
you know, towards the maybe more beneficial outcomes.

2761
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:17,700
Because if that aspect of this whole story

2762
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:18,980
was like continually suppressed

2763
01:48:18,980 --> 01:48:20,940
and always just pushed off to the side,

2764
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:24,020
it was just always, you know, only centered on,

2765
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:25,300
you know, many materials,

2766
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:27,820
anti-gravity, vacuum polarization,

2767
01:48:27,820 --> 01:48:29,660
Einstein carton, torsion terms,

2768
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:31,420
like how do we engineer space time?

2769
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:32,980
How do we develop, you know,

2770
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:35,140
that's effectively, you know,

2771
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:37,540
that's only one half of the story.

2772
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:39,820
And it's the half that's the more likely to go wrong

2773
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:42,180
in the way that you're, you know, worried about, right?

2774
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:44,820
It's like, we're more likely to try to develop

2775
01:48:44,820 --> 01:48:46,820
faster weapons and missiles and, you know,

2776
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:48,940
let's go colonize, let's try to take an asteroid.

2777
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:50,460
Oh, what you, that means now

2778
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:52,060
somebody could create an anti-gravity device

2779
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:53,820
that can move an asteroid and blow up the whole earth.

2780
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:54,700
Like, that's a problem.

2781
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:58,060
That's black box, that's a black ball technology.

2782
01:48:58,060 --> 01:49:00,820
But on the other hand, in the consciousness side,

2783
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:03,220
I think, I don't know, like,

2784
01:49:03,220 --> 01:49:05,020
because people haven't necessarily treated it

2785
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:06,900
as seriously as it needs to be,

2786
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:09,500
I don't know if as much analysis has gone into like,

2787
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:12,300
okay, you dip your hand into the consciousness jar,

2788
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:15,860
like what black balls are in the consciousness jar, right?

2789
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:17,820
If there's, you know, secret physics jar,

2790
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:20,620
dip your hand into the secret physics jar, you know,

2791
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:23,540
oh wait, we get to have maybe positive energy sources

2792
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:25,500
that, you know, we don't have to burn fossil fuels,

2793
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,380
we don't have to exploit the environment,

2794
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:29,820
but oh, but now we, you know, anyone can just like,

2795
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:32,340
zip around and take an asteroid and throw it at the earth.

2796
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:33,460
It's like, that's probably bad,

2797
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:34,900
but maybe we can have better defensive systems.

2798
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:37,100
But now you've got this whole new game theory

2799
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:39,060
of kind of the capability space

2800
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:41,180
that you have to reparameterize.

2801
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:42,980
Consciousness though, because we haven't,

2802
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:45,940
it's like, you know, at least with aerospace technologies

2803
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:48,500
and space war and space economy, we've got models,

2804
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:50,540
we've got, you know, the game theoretic dynamics,

2805
01:49:50,540 --> 01:49:52,220
the state and non-state, you know,

2806
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:55,020
kind of capacities to try to operationalize

2807
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:56,780
and it would be highly disruptive,

2808
01:49:56,780 --> 01:49:58,020
but it's like, we can even,

2809
01:49:58,020 --> 01:49:59,940
we can sort of start to create frameworks.

2810
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:02,540
The consciousness thing, you know,

2811
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:07,180
because we've put into this wooey jar of ineffable,

2812
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:09,820
somewhat, you know, very, you know,

2813
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:13,740
like, doesn't seem like a systematized thing, right?

2814
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:15,340
And when you have systematized capabilities,

2815
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:16,180
that turns into technology.

2816
01:50:16,180 --> 01:50:17,740
That's what technology is.

2817
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:19,500
So if it turns out that like,

2818
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,060
the program or other people have figured out

2819
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:22,580
that there's a certain part of the brain,

2820
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:23,900
that if you tickle in the right way,

2821
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:25,980
or you give the right drugs or whatever,

2822
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:28,940
that now like remote viewing is now 10x'd, right?

2823
01:50:28,940 --> 01:50:31,180
Or clairvoyance is now activated

2824
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:33,380
in a much larger sort of population or these,

2825
01:50:33,380 --> 01:50:35,380
you know, these nonverbal autistics

2826
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:37,340
that the whole Kai Dickens, you know,

2827
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:38,900
it's a little search, Lepithy Tapes has looked into that.

2828
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:40,180
I know you've interviewed her.

2829
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:42,380
It's like, okay, imagine that,

2830
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:44,540
imagine you were able to essentially, you know,

2831
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:47,260
take that capability, but activate it in,

2832
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:49,340
in not a nonverbal, but like just, you know,

2833
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:51,940
somebody else in slightly more,

2834
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:55,180
with a slightly more neurotypical sort of cognitive setup.

2835
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:58,500
And what does that do for our social norms, right?

2836
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:00,820
If you're, if you can read each other's minds, like,

2837
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:03,260
like, I mean, that would probably be, ironically,

2838
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:05,460
the one failure mode for Bitcoin,

2839
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:08,980
is if it turns out remote viewing is like hyper accurate,

2840
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:11,980
then like the security protocols for private keys

2841
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:12,940
needs to change.

2842
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:16,020
You've got a complete bi-directional transparency,

2843
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:18,700
you know, people would be able to remote view the cue codes,

2844
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:19,540
like it would be-

2845
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:21,260
Yeah, there'd be all sorts of, you know,

2846
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:22,860
countermeasures and there'd be, yeah,

2847
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:24,820
second and third order changes to a lot of things

2848
01:51:24,820 --> 01:51:28,820
with our basic assumptions around what humans can do,

2849
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:32,340
see and know or communicate is very different than what we-

2850
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:34,580
I just, I think we're in the stone age on this stuff.

2851
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:37,460
I always go back to this one line

2852
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:39,940
from the Kai Dickens telepathy tapes,

2853
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:42,940
where one of the kids, I'm forgetting exactly which one says,

2854
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:47,900
mom, you don't get my powers if you lie.

2855
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:50,060
And like, there's something so profound

2856
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:51,300
and important about that.

2857
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:53,420
And like, it's like this, you know,

2858
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:58,420
it's so easy for us to kind of, you know, import our own,

2859
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:00,980
you know, oh, let's just isolate, you know,

2860
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:02,860
the technique and turn it into a science

2861
01:52:02,860 --> 01:52:05,500
and make it repeatable, turn it into math somehow.

2862
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:06,620
And then there's something actually

2863
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:08,180
about like the deeper ontology,

2864
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:10,060
when you like hear what they're saying,

2865
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:13,020
they're talking about God in this like extremely intimate way.

2866
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:14,500
And by the way, you were earlier

2867
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:16,660
than anybody on the telepathy tapes.

2868
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:21,140
But yeah, like that seems more important than, you know,

2869
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:22,940
this sort of like need to just turn it

2870
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:24,900
into this like locally repeatable science

2871
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:27,020
as far as actually even making the thing work.

2872
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:28,740
But then even me saying that,

2873
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:30,500
like I'm not helping anybody by saying that.

2874
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:32,460
Like you literally just have to like fix yourself

2875
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:33,900
before you like get into this stuff.

2876
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:35,180
And a whole nother thing,

2877
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:36,700
it's you have to like bridge yourself

2878
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:38,260
into these different scenarios.

2879
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:40,420
But like if something like the Jason Sands scenario is true

2880
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:43,220
and there's essentially like part

2881
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:46,860
of our technological exploration of these phenomenon,

2882
01:52:46,860 --> 01:52:49,180
whether it's the, you know, more technical aspects

2883
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:51,660
or the, you know, the psychotechnical aspects,

2884
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:55,700
that that's essentially like a semi-regulated human activity,

2885
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:58,780
regulated by non-human intelligence per,

2886
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:01,620
at least to my perspective, like unknown norms, right?

2887
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:02,620
I'm sort of behavior.

2888
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:05,300
Like what's a permissible experiment

2889
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:06,540
that we can run with that technology?

2890
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:09,980
Like are there, it's like, in a certain sense,

2891
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:11,860
you could interpret that cautiously optimistically

2892
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:14,140
that there is some sort of regulative framework

2893
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:17,060
that's unknown to at least to me

2894
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:19,740
that is keeping guardrails on our exploration.

2895
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:21,020
Like we dip our hand in,

2896
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:22,380
we start to pick up the black box

2897
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:25,140
and some NHI hand goes, nope, right?

2898
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:27,820
Or we start to try to weaponize consciousness in a bad way.

2899
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:30,020
And they're like, no, you get turned off, right?

2900
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:32,380
Like I think there's even been accounts in the toilet.

2901
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:33,260
I think they can do that.

2902
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:34,460
I think it's a three body problem.

2903
01:53:34,460 --> 01:53:36,340
They can just shut us down whenever they want.

2904
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:38,340
So in a certain sense, it's like,

2905
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:39,820
okay, well how many tries,

2906
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:42,820
how many runs at that fence, right, do we get, right?

2907
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:44,980
As like a learning, you know, mode is like,

2908
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:47,020
okay, they're gonna test the fence.

2909
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:49,940
That's natural, every human civilization tests the fence.

2910
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:51,860
But in an intelligent civilization

2911
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:53,940
that keeps testing the fence,

2912
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:57,540
that looks like they might try to break through the fence,

2913
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:59,060
well, they need to be put down, right?

2914
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:02,220
That's the implicit threat.

2915
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:03,740
But you know, also like opportunities like,

2916
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:05,700
oh, if we recognize the fence is there

2917
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:08,260
and we like stop trying to test the fence line,

2918
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:11,060
it's an inherent challenge to our sovereignty

2919
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:13,140
and our place in the hierarchy of being,

2920
01:54:13,140 --> 01:54:15,260
but it then removes the existential risk.

2921
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:16,100
And it means that, okay,

2922
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:17,700
as long as you recognize we're in this fence,

2923
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:20,940
that we can sort of continue to develop ourselves

2924
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:23,220
technologically and maybe, you know, psychically

2925
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:27,140
in a garden, essentially, right?

2926
01:54:27,140 --> 01:54:29,860
And then when we reach a certain level of maturity,

2927
01:54:29,860 --> 01:54:30,700
where we're let out.

2928
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:33,740
Well, that is, I think the garden or the fence

2929
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:35,700
is like materialist reductionism.

2930
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:39,820
And like you see like with saints, for example,

2931
01:54:39,820 --> 01:54:41,460
as they sort of like lose their own

2932
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:43,220
like materialist reductionist worldview,

2933
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:45,740
not that like many of these people existed

2934
01:54:45,740 --> 01:54:47,100
pre-materialist reductionism,

2935
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:50,700
but like as they start to ascend into like higher,

2936
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:51,700
it's kind of, you know, again,

2937
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:53,020
I'm using really vague words,

2938
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:56,140
but like interactions with the celestial or whatever,

2939
01:54:57,660 --> 01:54:59,780
they sort of freaks them out

2940
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:01,660
and they have to like look within,

2941
01:55:01,660 --> 01:55:02,820
they have to reform themselves

2942
01:55:02,820 --> 01:55:04,340
and it's the sort of like two steps forward,

2943
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:06,060
one step back process.

2944
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:08,900
And so I do wonder on some level,

2945
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:10,140
like, you know, I've for example,

2946
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:12,620
been so pro disclosure up until now

2947
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:15,500
it does feel like this sort of Pandora's box

2948
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,980
and Pandora's box in the sense that like,

2949
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:19,140
you know, you have hope,

2950
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:21,380
but then there's like a whole lot of like,

2951
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:23,340
you know, bad stuff that comes with it.

2952
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:26,220
I mean, I think this is where we're, you know,

2953
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:27,660
we need new institutions,

2954
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:29,980
which are fundamentally just more accreted,

2955
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:31,940
more formal structures of norms

2956
01:55:31,940 --> 01:55:35,700
and human sort of collective beliefs, right?

2957
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:37,740
Like this is a phenomenon that we need to construct

2958
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:40,300
an entire new institutional framework around, right?

2959
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:44,540
Not just a, you know, not just a, you know, an LLC, right?

2960
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:47,340
You need like, you need actually novel institutions

2961
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,380
to confront this novel phenomenon.

2962
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:51,780
I think the institutions that we created

2963
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:53,420
or kind of that we, you know,

2964
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:56,740
we sort of wrapped around this information, you know,

2965
01:55:56,740 --> 01:55:59,060
were essentially our military and scientific institutions

2966
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:01,660
wedded to the state apparatus in the post-war environment.

2967
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:03,180
And those are certain institutions

2968
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:05,500
set up by certain people with a certain mission

2969
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:08,700
and mandate and psychological orientation to the state

2970
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:11,860
and their class and their military and scientific

2971
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:13,460
and intelligence prerogatives.

2972
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:16,460
And so that, you know, that institution was what was,

2973
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:18,860
what was now sort of absorbed to this technology

2974
01:56:18,860 --> 01:56:20,900
or this phenomenon and had to understand it,

2975
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:23,020
try to apply it, et cetera.

2976
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:25,340
But if you were like starting from scratch,

2977
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:27,340
like that would not be the ideal institutions

2978
01:56:27,340 --> 01:56:29,820
you would want to give like that,

2979
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:33,460
that mandate of like how to level humanity up, right?

2980
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:35,940
By minimizing risk and maximizing opportunity

2981
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:38,260
for collective success and flourishing, right?

2982
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:40,180
Given whatever constraints that might exist.

2983
01:56:40,180 --> 01:56:43,140
And that means like, you truly do need like

2984
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:46,020
blank sheet of paper, new institutions, right?

2985
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:47,340
From the bottom up, right?

2986
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:49,340
New institutions to study it, to finance it,

2987
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:51,420
to organize around it, to diffuse it,

2988
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:53,180
to create new norms around it.

2989
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:56,700
Like that's a massive human project that we have even,

2990
01:56:56,700 --> 01:56:58,300
because no one who has a collective acceptance

2991
01:56:58,300 --> 01:56:59,860
and disclosure is a thing coming,

2992
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:01,620
but like the big project of post-disclosure

2993
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:03,660
is gonna be, you know, creating new institutions

2994
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:06,300
or adapting or likely existing institutions

2995
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,940
or some combination of the two,

2996
01:57:07,940 --> 01:57:09,540
to carry forward that project, right?

2997
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:12,060
So you think we should build a Bitcoin,

2998
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:16,180
exotic physics and spiritual development foundation?

2999
01:57:16,180 --> 01:57:17,500
Is that what you're trying to say?

3000
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:20,180
You know, this is the game is take all your side quests

3001
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:22,540
and turn them into the main quest, right?

3002
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:24,860
It's like, you know, I've been on the geopolitical

3003
01:57:24,860 --> 01:57:28,420
and cyber, you know, intelligence sort of, you know,

3004
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:31,060
main quest and then Bitcoin has now become the main quest.

3005
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:33,660
And then UAPs were the side quest, you know,

3006
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:36,500
like the next logical move is just to make them all

3007
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:37,700
the same thing, right?

3008
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:40,700
Now, I don't know how to do that, obviously,

3009
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:42,100
but I think it's going back to the very beginning

3010
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:43,780
of the conversation is interesting phenomenon

3011
01:57:43,780 --> 01:57:47,980
that like Bitcoin is a sociotechnical system

3012
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:48,900
and has elements.

3013
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:50,380
It's a core technical breakthrough.

3014
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:51,900
It's a, you know, it's a piece of software

3015
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:53,500
that people are running, you know,

3016
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:55,380
but it is also, it's a meme, right?

3017
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:57,140
It's a set of collective beliefs.

3018
01:57:57,140 --> 01:57:58,940
And the interesting thing about Bitcoin,

3019
01:57:58,940 --> 01:57:59,780
the reason why maybe it's like,

3020
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:02,380
have this like hyper acceleration in terms of its adoption

3021
01:58:02,380 --> 01:58:05,260
and then kind of this reflectivity is that

3022
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:10,060
that mimetic sociotechnical system has an endogenous asset

3023
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:13,540
that essentially gives the believers

3024
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:17,420
of that sociotechnical systems potential,

3025
01:58:17,420 --> 01:58:20,380
more power in the world to spread that,

3026
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:22,580
to spread the gospel essentially, right?

3027
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:23,780
And so there's a flywheel embedded

3028
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:26,860
into sort of this mimetic machine.

3029
01:58:26,860 --> 01:58:29,220
With the UAP subject, there really isn't that flywheel,

3030
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:30,060
right, that's built in.

3031
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:31,900
You have podcasts, you have advertising revenue

3032
01:58:31,900 --> 01:58:33,180
for people that are interested in this thing,

3033
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:35,500
but it's not like that big, right?

3034
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:38,060
But obviously I think in general,

3035
01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:39,860
I mean, the Bitcoin community will like, you know,

3036
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:40,860
cast me as an apostate,

3037
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:42,300
but I think ultimately the UAP question

3038
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:44,100
is more important than the Bitcoin question.

3039
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:47,660
But I think, you know, the fuel to create

3040
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:50,500
the new institutions you need in a post-disclosure world,

3041
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:52,780
I think will actually come from Bitcoin.

3042
01:58:52,780 --> 01:58:53,620
Makes sense, yeah.

3043
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:55,980
I think you have, and you know, my buddy Zell,

3044
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:57,100
he gave me these numbers.

3045
01:58:57,100 --> 01:59:00,540
He's like, if Bitcoin monetizes to the level of gold,

3046
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:02,700
right, you know, relatively on a global, you know,

3047
01:59:02,700 --> 01:59:06,340
say market cap or sort of market value basis,

3048
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:07,900
then you'll have roughly equal numbers

3049
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:10,740
of Bitcoin billionaires and say fiat billionaires

3050
01:59:10,740 --> 01:59:11,780
in the world. That's wild.

3051
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:14,460
Which is kind of a unique historical circumstance, right?

3052
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:17,260
That you have this new class of very wealthy people

3053
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:19,300
that all basically believe very similar things

3054
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:22,300
and are also very heterodox thinkers,

3055
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:23,780
they're relatively young,

3056
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:26,500
and they've now had success in building

3057
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:29,860
a sort of a novel global non-state institution

3058
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:33,100
that's now given them a lot of political power, right?

3059
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:35,300
And they're probably interested in lots of things, right?

3060
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:37,180
They're probably curious about the world.

3061
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:39,700
And they're not wedded to, you know, particularly,

3062
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:41,380
and they probably want to have an impact with that wealth,

3063
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:42,220
right, what do you do?

3064
01:59:42,220 --> 01:59:44,140
You have a bunch of Bitcoin, like congrats, right?

3065
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:45,620
Go on your island, like chill.

3066
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:47,340
Or like maybe you should invest

3067
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:48,980
in the deepest secrets of the universe

3068
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:50,660
and like help unlock humanity's potential.

3069
01:59:50,660 --> 01:59:52,380
That would be cool if the billionaires

3070
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:54,900
weren't just posturing around who has a bigger yacht

3071
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,740
or whatever, you know, buying private islands.

3072
01:59:56,740 --> 01:59:58,900
I mean, wouldn't it be like amazing just to endow

3073
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:01,860
like a, yeah, like a research syndicate

3074
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:04,700
and a institution that is like,

3075
02:00:04,700 --> 02:00:07,940
imagine if you had the philosopher kings of ancient Greece

3076
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:10,460
with alien craft and billions of dollars.

3077
02:00:10,460 --> 02:00:11,460
That would be awesome.

3078
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:14,060
So yeah, I think that would be really, really cool.

3079
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:17,620
Just like, I think that some of the,

3080
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:18,940
what I worry about, you know,

3081
02:00:18,940 --> 02:00:20,500
as far as what might be happening now

3082
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:23,100
is like this like need to like operationalize.

3083
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:25,860
Like you have no priors on the history of success

3084
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:27,500
on the program itself.

3085
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:28,900
You have very little priors.

3086
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:30,380
It's just this black box.

3087
02:00:30,380 --> 02:00:33,340
And you're like operationalizing these like little things

3088
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:35,940
kind of as an extension, like this sort of private,

3089
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:39,380
you know, public partnership de facto thing or whatever.

3090
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:42,020
And like, I worry about that if you don't have

3091
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:44,220
like a good mental map of like what's going on overall,

3092
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:46,460
just like I would worry about like the government

3093
02:00:46,460 --> 02:00:48,580
doing things without any sort of mental map,

3094
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:52,420
just because like your only mandate is like national security.

3095
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:54,580
And so I do think like having the, you know,

3096
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:57,860
modern Plato's Symposium is like a fantastic idea.

3097
02:00:57,860 --> 02:01:02,740
And just people who are good-willed or earnest,

3098
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:07,420
just trying to figure, having to have, figure out a map

3099
02:01:08,180 --> 02:01:12,300
and then aligning yourself with the good stuff.

3100
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:14,180
And then you can like, you know,

3101
02:01:14,180 --> 02:01:16,300
get a little more operational after that or something.

3102
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:18,300
I think there's definitely a, you know,

3103
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:20,580
a path dependency here that could go wrong

3104
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:22,580
in many different ways, like building new institutions

3105
02:01:22,580 --> 02:01:27,580
that serve their original, say like naive original mandate

3106
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:30,660
is a difficult process, right?

3107
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:32,660
We've seen this go wrong, like in many cases

3108
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:35,020
where you create something, it's really well-motivated

3109
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:36,940
and then it gets distorted or bent over time

3110
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:38,860
or internally corrupted or distracted.

3111
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:40,020
And it's very hard, right?

3112
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:43,580
I think that's just, there's no one weird trick to do that.

3113
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:48,260
But it's a project that it seems like, you know,

3114
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:50,420
I don't think we're ready to do that right now,

3115
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:52,460
but it is a project that I think you would need

3116
02:01:52,460 --> 02:01:55,020
to focus on in a post-disclosure environment, right?

3117
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:57,980
I think right now we're in this moment where we're not there.

3118
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:00,540
And so it's like, well, how do you catalyze disclosure

3119
02:02:00,540 --> 02:02:02,860
without waiting for big daddy government to give it to you?

3120
02:02:02,860 --> 02:02:04,620
Well, you have to now do it on your own.

3121
02:02:04,620 --> 02:02:06,260
And that's essentially what I think the Skywatcher team

3122
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:08,700
is trying to do is essentially we're trying to collect

3123
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:10,700
with, you know, private resources and our skills

3124
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:13,580
and knowledge from our aspects of engagement with the program,

3125
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:16,540
you know, enough information to convince, you know,

3126
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:18,780
a marginally more subset of the population

3127
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:21,220
of the reality of this phenomenon.

3128
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:24,300
And disclosure is not like a, you know, like,

3129
02:02:24,300 --> 02:02:25,260
oh, this is disclosure.

3130
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:28,460
It's a process that unfolds, more and more people

3131
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:30,900
just leveling up their priors on more

3132
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:32,580
of these different hypotheses.

3133
02:02:32,580 --> 02:02:34,180
And eventually you get to the point where,

3134
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:35,740
oh, there's a billionaire here, there's a billionaire here,

3135
02:02:35,740 --> 02:02:37,300
there's a billionaire here, there's a bunch of scientists,

3136
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:39,580
there's a bunch of academics, there's a bunch of policy people.

3137
02:02:39,580 --> 02:02:41,340
And they all now collectively look at each other

3138
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:42,420
in this kind of this, you know,

3139
02:02:42,420 --> 02:02:44,580
preference falsification cascade and they go,

3140
02:02:44,580 --> 02:02:46,940
oh, this is a serious thing, it's real,

3141
02:02:46,940 --> 02:02:50,140
it needs to be seriously addressed at scale in a novel way

3142
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:52,820
like our existing institutions can't really confront.

3143
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:53,980
Like, oh, you got to think like Rand,

3144
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:54,820
they can do some things.

3145
02:02:54,820 --> 02:02:55,660
You've got some venture capital people,

3146
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:56,500
they can do some things.

3147
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,020
You've got academic institutions,

3148
02:02:58,020 --> 02:02:59,900
you've got, you know, Gary Nolan at Stanford.

3149
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:02,340
Everyone's trying to take their own pieces

3150
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:05,060
of current institutions and trying to contribute

3151
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:07,580
to some, you know, initiative,

3152
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:08,660
Soul Foundation, et cetera.

3153
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:10,660
I think it's all necessary and admirable,

3154
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:13,140
but it's clearly just these raw individual

3155
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:14,900
heroic initiatives, right?

3156
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:18,020
And clearly the ultimate question is so much larger

3157
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:20,140
than what, you know, individual heroic efforts

3158
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:21,380
are going to be able to accomplish, right?

3159
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:23,620
That's a necessary just first step.

3160
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:26,260
But like, if you're really, you know,

3161
02:03:26,260 --> 02:03:29,340
trying to put yourself in this post disclosure,

3162
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:32,180
whatever that is world, you know,

3163
02:03:32,180 --> 02:03:33,860
it's going to catalyze a lot of change

3164
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:36,260
and a potential lot of, you know, disruption

3165
02:03:36,260 --> 02:03:37,860
to existing institutions.

3166
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:40,980
And I think it's important that you have the germs

3167
02:03:40,980 --> 02:03:43,460
of new institutions that can kind of, you know,

3168
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:45,220
act as ballast, right?

3169
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:47,220
To kind of absorb that.

3170
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:49,940
And I think, you know, I'm not shilling Bicoid here,

3171
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:51,340
but it's like, Bicoid is interesting

3172
02:03:51,340 --> 02:03:53,540
because it has these features of it's a global,

3173
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:56,780
non-state, you know, socio-technical system

3174
02:03:56,780 --> 02:03:59,260
that has its own endogenous network, endogenous asset

3175
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:03,380
and, you know, third party free sort of, you know, network

3176
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:06,460
with a lot of people with a lot of capital embedded in it.

3177
02:04:06,460 --> 02:04:09,660
So it's like a substrate that you could potentially

3178
02:04:09,660 --> 02:04:10,660
use to catalyze, you know,

3179
02:04:10,660 --> 02:04:12,740
nucleate different institutions, right?

3180
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:15,380
That are somewhat orthogonal

3181
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:16,980
to the existing institutional structures, right?

3182
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:18,700
They have relationships too, right?

3183
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:20,500
They're not like completely on an island,

3184
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:23,460
but it's a degree of freedom that didn't exist before.

3185
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:25,380
And there might be new possibilities

3186
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:28,420
between mixing and matching old and new together

3187
02:04:28,420 --> 02:04:30,420
that could, you know, provide a basis

3188
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:31,260
to do something different

3189
02:04:31,260 --> 02:04:33,260
that these institutions just hard, right?

3190
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:37,140
Like the classic Francis Fukuyama curve,

3191
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:37,980
you can read his book,

3192
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:39,500
Political Order, Political Decay,

3193
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:41,500
brilliant diagnosis of kind of human history

3194
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:44,220
and the sorts of different social institutions,

3195
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:46,180
governance systems we've created.

3196
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:50,020
And they historically all follow this similar pattern, right?

3197
02:04:50,020 --> 02:04:54,940
Where there's, you know, founding, you know,

3198
02:04:54,940 --> 02:04:58,900
partners of the state or even religious organizations

3199
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:01,180
and they're imbued with energy.

3200
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:04,620
They're successful because they solved some aspect

3201
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:06,660
of a novel problem in the environment

3202
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:08,940
that the existing institutions couldn't, right?

3203
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:12,500
So they now have the alpha, right?

3204
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:13,940
They're now creating something new

3205
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:15,540
and they've figured out, you know,

3206
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:17,700
a new niche to expand and explore

3207
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:18,980
and they can build something, right?

3208
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:20,100
A new institution.

3209
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:22,500
And it gets momentum, it gets energy.

3210
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:23,980
They're creating something.

3211
02:05:23,980 --> 02:05:25,700
They have a sense of purpose and vision

3212
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:26,540
and sort of founding,

3213
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:28,340
it's like the founding fathers of America, et cetera.

3214
02:05:28,340 --> 02:05:30,380
Like those are idolized because there was, you know,

3215
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:32,580
that's like the, you know,

3216
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:36,180
they were creating this novel institution called America.

3217
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:38,500
And then there's some, you know,

3218
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:41,860
process by which those institutions

3219
02:05:41,860 --> 02:05:43,340
start to increasingly formalize.

3220
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:45,660
At the beginning, they're very personalized, right?

3221
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:47,060
Say it's Satoshi, right?

3222
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:49,260
Everyone knows like that's a person.

3223
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:51,700
Hal Finney, that's a person, right?

3224
02:05:51,700 --> 02:05:53,780
You know, the founding fathers, those are people.

3225
02:05:53,780 --> 02:05:55,020
Like their individual decisions

3226
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:56,500
made a huge amount of difference.

3227
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:59,380
Like the Federalist Papers and Declaration of Independence

3228
02:05:59,380 --> 02:06:01,500
and these initial amendments to the constitution.

3229
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:03,060
These were like, again, like going back

3230
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:03,940
to the Big Bay analogy,

3231
02:06:03,940 --> 02:06:05,420
like there was a lot of degrees of freedom

3232
02:06:05,420 --> 02:06:07,380
and those initial founders were like the first,

3233
02:06:07,380 --> 02:06:08,500
they had a lot of first mover advantage

3234
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:10,380
to kind of condense that space down

3235
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:11,620
and then create a structure

3236
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:15,340
that could create a possibility space

3237
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:17,380
for lots of other things to evolve.

3238
02:06:17,380 --> 02:06:19,980
But in a political kind of evolution,

3239
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:22,260
like in Fukuyama's terms,

3240
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:23,820
you know, that starts to get settled

3241
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:27,180
and then the next generations kind of refine,

3242
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:31,500
optimize, formalize, depersonalize as institutions, right?

3243
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:34,620
Now it's like a bureaucracy with, you know,

3244
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:36,540
titles and roles that get handed down

3245
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:37,980
on a result ideally of merit.

3246
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:40,260
It's not just like the brother or cousin or son

3247
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:41,700
that takes on that role.

3248
02:06:42,740 --> 02:06:46,460
And that's a formal modern institutional structure

3249
02:06:46,460 --> 02:06:47,700
and that usually works for some time

3250
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:49,740
until like any institutional structure,

3251
02:06:49,740 --> 02:06:52,340
like software code, you know, you start from scratch

3252
02:06:52,340 --> 02:06:53,780
and it usually does what it's supposed to do.

3253
02:06:53,780 --> 02:06:57,020
Over time, you have to, you know, edit, add additional,

3254
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:58,780
you know, modules or make, you know,

3255
02:06:58,780 --> 02:07:01,740
a new program comes in and slap something different on

3256
02:07:01,740 --> 02:07:02,980
and it starts to develop, you know,

3257
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:05,140
what's called Bohm's law, which is like rot software.

3258
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:08,100
Software tends to rot like on like a mathematical curve.

3259
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:09,660
And I think the same thing with the human institutions

3260
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:11,540
which are systems of norms and rules,

3261
02:07:11,540 --> 02:07:15,660
basically embedded into a certain institutional framework.

3262
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:18,380
And so you get to this point where the rules

3263
02:07:18,380 --> 02:07:20,300
basically start to become overburdened

3264
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:23,460
and they are increasingly rigid

3265
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:25,740
and they can't adapt to what ultimately, you know,

3266
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:27,220
world is chaos, world is change.

3267
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:30,580
And so human institutions that go through this pattern

3268
02:07:30,580 --> 02:07:33,420
eventually start to lag reality, right?

3269
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:35,060
And then there's inefficiencies,

3270
02:07:35,060 --> 02:07:37,220
there's costs that start to accrue over time.

3271
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:39,540
And you get to this critical point in any institution

3272
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:43,020
where the systems of rules become too rigid

3273
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:44,460
and they can't adapt to reality.

3274
02:07:44,460 --> 02:07:48,180
And the lag, the gap between essentially their design

3275
02:07:48,180 --> 02:07:50,180
and the need for them to perform

3276
02:07:50,180 --> 02:07:52,220
given the external environment becomes too great

3277
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:53,220
and they're very brittle.

3278
02:07:53,220 --> 02:07:54,500
And then you get a shock.

3279
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:55,620
You get a war, you get a famine,

3280
02:07:55,620 --> 02:07:58,340
you get a cyber attack now, like who knows?

3281
02:07:58,340 --> 02:08:00,980
Something happens and it breaks the institution.

3282
02:08:00,980 --> 02:08:02,540
It's like a nonlinear change.

3283
02:08:02,540 --> 02:08:03,620
And then everyone realizes,

3284
02:08:03,620 --> 02:08:06,300
oh, this is not gonna work anymore, right?

3285
02:08:06,300 --> 02:08:08,740
And then, you know, everyone along the line is sort of,

3286
02:08:08,740 --> 02:08:11,140
okay, kick the can, kick the can, kick the can.

3287
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:13,500
It's worked well this far.

3288
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:15,460
You know, that curve will just keep going.

3289
02:08:15,460 --> 02:08:18,420
I don't wanna have to make the hard choices on my watch,

3290
02:08:18,420 --> 02:08:19,260
right?

3291
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:20,780
Like just make it someone else's problem,

3292
02:08:20,780 --> 02:08:22,420
you know, in the next election, et cetera.

3293
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:25,580
And that works, you know, up until it doesn't, right?

3294
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:27,460
And then the institutions really break

3295
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:28,820
and then there's a crisis.

3296
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:30,420
And then you have to make a call.

3297
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:33,220
You either, eventually just like,

3298
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:36,020
it's like post-Soviet Russia where it's just,

3299
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:38,020
the institutions are completely demoralized

3300
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:40,900
and just taken apart and, you know, privatized

3301
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:41,900
and the mafia's takeover.

3302
02:08:41,900 --> 02:08:43,620
And you really degrade society back

3303
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:45,940
to a very like pre-state state, right?

3304
02:08:45,940 --> 02:08:48,540
It's warlordism, essentially, fascinalism.

3305
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:50,980
Or you recognize that crisis coming

3306
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:53,540
and you realize you need to kind of like bounce, right?

3307
02:08:53,540 --> 02:08:55,700
You need to create new institutions, right?

3308
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:59,620
That can sort of take that crisis energy and direct it,

3309
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:02,260
you know, formalize it and then create new founding,

3310
02:09:02,260 --> 02:09:03,940
you know, teams to sort of, okay,

3311
02:09:03,940 --> 02:09:07,700
now we can build something out of this crisis, right?

3312
02:09:07,700 --> 02:09:08,900
And so if you think about, you know,

3313
02:09:08,900 --> 02:09:11,620
the disclosures being this kind of recognition

3314
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:14,100
that the legacy program is rotten, basically,

3315
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:16,140
in more ways than one, maybe bureaucratically,

3316
02:09:16,140 --> 02:09:19,100
institutionally, maybe also morally rotten.

3317
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:21,900
And it may be in the process of breaking, basically, right?

3318
02:09:21,900 --> 02:09:23,260
Everyone's defecting out of it, right?

3319
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:25,140
That's what seems to be happening.

3320
02:09:25,140 --> 02:09:26,180
That's also what you see happening

3321
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:28,020
when other institutions break, right?

3322
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:30,300
People look around, they go, oh, well, like,

3323
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:32,460
this isn't gonna, my future isn't here anymore.

3324
02:09:32,460 --> 02:09:33,340
Like, I gotta get out.

3325
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:35,500
Like, now it's the first,

3326
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:38,340
whoever was out first basically wins, right?

3327
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:39,780
It's how, you know, police organizations

3328
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:40,820
take down mafias, right?

3329
02:09:40,820 --> 02:09:42,900
You sort of chip away at it until everyone realizes,

3330
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:45,020
oh, wait, like, my boss is gonna turn on me.

3331
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:47,220
So I better be the first one to rat or whatever.

3332
02:09:47,220 --> 02:09:49,540
So you get this nonlinear cascade collapse.

3333
02:09:49,540 --> 02:09:52,020
And if that's what's happening here, okay,

3334
02:09:52,020 --> 02:09:53,340
it's gonna be good from one perspective,

3335
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:55,300
like the rotten institution is failing,

3336
02:09:55,300 --> 02:10:00,020
but that can go really wrong if you don't have, you know,

3337
02:10:00,020 --> 02:10:02,980
in mind new institutions that you wanna, you know,

3338
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:05,820
start to nucleate that can sort of take that energy

3339
02:10:05,820 --> 02:10:07,700
in a much more positive direction.

3340
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:09,660
So maybe that's, you know,

3341
02:10:09,660 --> 02:10:12,380
that's sort of the motivating conceptual framework

3342
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:14,820
to think about how do you do that?

3343
02:10:14,820 --> 02:10:17,140
How do you build institutions to,

3344
02:10:17,140 --> 02:10:18,620
that can take into account the whole pluralistic

3345
02:10:18,620 --> 02:10:21,100
diversity of perspectives on what's really happening here.

3346
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:23,020
It's not like a new religion that's gonna,

3347
02:10:23,020 --> 02:10:24,620
because that could be the failure mode, right?

3348
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:28,420
You get factionalism, you get people that just in the chaos,

3349
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:29,980
you know, pick on one thing

3350
02:10:29,980 --> 02:10:32,100
and create a new religious institution, right?

3351
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:33,780
That's what we'd like to do.

3352
02:10:33,780 --> 02:10:35,180
We need certainty of belief.

3353
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:38,580
But that's how you create cults,

3354
02:10:38,580 --> 02:10:40,820
that's how you create, you know, internal division,

3355
02:10:40,820 --> 02:10:43,780
you essentially state decay or collapse even.

3356
02:10:43,780 --> 02:10:45,740
And so how do you, you know, avoid that, right?

3357
02:10:45,740 --> 02:10:48,100
Ideally, you wanna maintain what we currently have built

3358
02:10:48,100 --> 02:10:50,180
in terms of modern, pluralistic, you know,

3359
02:10:50,180 --> 02:10:53,820
scientifically grounded, you know, social organizations

3360
02:10:53,820 --> 02:10:58,020
that now have to sort of adapt and reconfigure to address,

3361
02:10:58,020 --> 02:10:59,700
you know, maybe a new possibility space

3362
02:10:59,740 --> 02:11:02,740
for technology and humanity itself.

3363
02:11:02,740 --> 02:11:05,340
And that's a non-trivial thing to do,

3364
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:07,460
but I don't know, I think it's like an important project.

3365
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:10,340
And you look around, like, who's got the money to fund that?

3366
02:11:10,340 --> 02:11:12,980
That would be like crazy enough to try, right?

3367
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:14,980
I actually think it'd probably be like a bunch of Bitcoiners

3368
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:16,300
that would be willing to do that, right?

3369
02:11:16,300 --> 02:11:18,820
They'd be like, we kind of did that, like with Bitcoin,

3370
02:11:18,820 --> 02:11:20,940
like this is the next bit, right?

3371
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:22,340
We're gonna do that next.

3372
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:23,900
So that might be a bit of a LARP right now,

3373
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:25,300
but I don't know, it's non-trivial to me

3374
02:11:25,300 --> 02:11:26,260
that in the next few years,

3375
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:29,380
you could see something like that could get created,

3376
02:11:29,380 --> 02:11:30,220
I think it'd be kind of cool.

3377
02:11:30,220 --> 02:11:32,740
Well, I'm curious to see where things go from here, Matt,

3378
02:11:32,740 --> 02:11:35,980
and I feel like you're on the forefront of so much of it,

3379
02:11:35,980 --> 02:11:39,620
and yeah, it's an exciting, wild time.

3380
02:11:39,620 --> 02:11:41,620
I have a feeling 2025 is just gonna be

3381
02:11:41,620 --> 02:11:45,420
one of the weirdest years we've had, maybe in a millennium.

3382
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:48,900
I mean, I think it's a safe prediction at any given year

3383
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:51,060
to say this will be the weirdest year.

3384
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:53,100
I think that just, we're just on that curve.

3385
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:54,340
Yeah. And just, you know.

3386
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:55,620
It's getting weirder and weirder.

3387
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:57,580
Yeah, and so like,

3388
02:11:57,620 --> 02:12:00,100
it's more about the derivative of weirdness.

3389
02:12:00,100 --> 02:12:01,500
Is that gonna accelerate?

3390
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:05,620
I think it might be a step-wise leap, but I don't know.

3391
02:12:05,620 --> 02:12:09,060
Yeah, well, that's one little personal commentary is like,

3392
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:11,220
this is the interesting thing is,

3393
02:12:11,220 --> 02:12:12,620
you know, going wrapping all this together,

3394
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:15,100
like the Bitcoin, the AI, the alien, these things are,

3395
02:12:15,100 --> 02:12:16,820
if you imagine there's kind of this,

3396
02:12:16,820 --> 02:12:19,700
there's this median distribution of opinion,

3397
02:12:19,700 --> 02:12:21,500
what's considered kind of inside the orbiting window,

3398
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:22,540
and it's a distribution,

3399
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:25,500
and there's some ineffable sort of zone outside,

3400
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:27,260
where if you're outside that zone,

3401
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:30,420
you're either a conspiracy theorist, you're a fringe,

3402
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:34,740
kook, you're, you know, just, you're out there, right?

3403
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:36,220
And then there are things that are like legitimate,

3404
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:38,420
but like kind of, you know,

3405
02:12:38,420 --> 02:12:39,740
still considered somewhat impolite,

3406
02:12:39,740 --> 02:12:41,020
and that's like almost like Hedena syndrome

3407
02:12:41,020 --> 02:12:42,140
sorts of stuff, right?

3408
02:12:42,140 --> 02:12:44,100
It's like just inside the over the window, but disputed,

3409
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:46,020
but people say it's a kooky thing, but lots of people,

3410
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:48,220
yeah, but now it's increasingly a serious thing.

3411
02:12:48,220 --> 02:12:51,940
And what's fascinating is the individuals, right?

3412
02:12:51,940 --> 02:12:53,380
And maybe myself, right?

3413
02:12:53,380 --> 02:12:55,580
I've sort of gravitated to sort of stay on that,

3414
02:12:56,060 --> 02:12:57,980
whatever that liminal zone is,

3415
02:12:57,980 --> 02:12:59,460
I think, I don't know, psychologically,

3416
02:12:59,460 --> 02:13:01,700
but I'm just attracted to that part,

3417
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:03,180
like things that are coming in

3418
02:13:03,180 --> 02:13:06,020
off of that side of the distribution.

3419
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:07,260
But you almost think of it as like a wave,

3420
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:08,740
because I think that whole distribution

3421
02:13:08,740 --> 02:13:10,740
of itself is moving, right?

3422
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:13,860
And so ironically, if I like picked a certain point

3423
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:16,020
on that curve and just stayed there,

3424
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:19,140
like what my like fringe opinions on Bitcoin

3425
02:13:19,140 --> 02:13:20,980
and UAPs four or five years ago

3426
02:13:20,980 --> 02:13:24,380
are now like increasingly like normie, right?

3427
02:13:24,460 --> 02:13:26,740
And so it's like, if I don't like constantly try

3428
02:13:26,740 --> 02:13:28,820
to look further out, right?

3429
02:13:28,820 --> 02:13:31,300
It's like, oh, the reality of non-human intelligence

3430
02:13:31,300 --> 02:13:32,980
was like fully out there.

3431
02:13:32,980 --> 02:13:34,420
Now it's like coming in.

3432
02:13:34,420 --> 02:13:36,100
And now you've got this new, now you've got psionics.

3433
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:36,940
It's like, oof, well, okay,

3434
02:13:36,940 --> 02:13:39,060
that's the new thing out there.

3435
02:13:39,060 --> 02:13:40,540
But that's probably also coming in.

3436
02:13:40,540 --> 02:13:42,180
So like this whole curve I'm looking at,

3437
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:43,180
I'm like, and I'm just,

3438
02:13:43,180 --> 02:13:45,220
I didn't know what the shape of that curve is.

3439
02:13:45,220 --> 02:13:47,940
All I know is like where I am sort of on it,

3440
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:50,380
through like, I get sort of subtle feedback on Twitter

3441
02:13:50,380 --> 02:13:52,060
and professional and semi-professional networks

3442
02:13:52,060 --> 02:13:53,980
of like, where am I on this curve?

3443
02:13:54,580 --> 02:13:58,060
It's like a clue to how fast the median shape is moving.

3444
02:13:58,060 --> 02:14:00,020
And it seems like that whole shape is moving

3445
02:14:00,020 --> 02:14:02,060
this direction, right?

3446
02:14:02,060 --> 02:14:04,420
Which is, if you take any stats class,

3447
02:14:04,420 --> 02:14:07,460
like if you move the mean of a distribution,

3448
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:09,620
like the tails explode, right?

3449
02:14:09,620 --> 02:14:12,660
There's like an asymmetric like effect.

3450
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:14,420
Like if you cut off the left side, right?

3451
02:14:14,420 --> 02:14:16,580
The right side explodes, right?

3452
02:14:17,580 --> 02:14:20,380
And so there's just like a statistical analogy here,

3453
02:14:20,380 --> 02:14:22,420
which is even if it's like a subtle movement

3454
02:14:22,460 --> 02:14:25,420
in the mean perception of these things,

3455
02:14:25,420 --> 02:14:27,900
like the effect on the margin,

3456
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:29,820
especially what that threshold is,

3457
02:14:29,820 --> 02:14:31,420
is changing much faster.

3458
02:14:31,420 --> 02:14:32,260
Yep.

3459
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:33,100
I think that's what you see now.

3460
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:35,060
That's what your podcast think represents.

3461
02:14:35,060 --> 02:14:35,900
Yeah.

3462
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:36,740
I think that's like,

3463
02:14:36,740 --> 02:14:38,780
that's the alpha of the Josie Michaels podcast.

3464
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:41,900
Well, it's funny to watch these like people

3465
02:14:41,900 --> 02:14:45,220
who have credentials that well exceed mine,

3466
02:14:45,220 --> 02:14:47,060
but they're like, they have to like call me

3467
02:14:47,060 --> 02:14:48,540
like on signal or something, you know?

3468
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:50,300
And they have to just be like, you know,

3469
02:14:50,300 --> 02:14:52,220
okay, maybe there's something here

3470
02:14:53,140 --> 02:14:54,780
send me some papers on it or whatever.

3471
02:14:54,780 --> 02:14:56,900
They can't like kind of like fully like own it

3472
02:14:56,900 --> 02:14:59,180
because it's like too fringy for them.

3473
02:14:59,180 --> 02:15:00,180
And so it's like this,

3474
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:02,420
and then they do some like hedging thing publicly

3475
02:15:02,420 --> 02:15:04,500
where they're like, we should look into this,

3476
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:06,900
but there's 99% like nothing there.

3477
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:09,100
And then you just watch them like crumbling,

3478
02:15:09,100 --> 02:15:11,380
like over time, like as they realized

3479
02:15:11,380 --> 02:15:13,100
everything's just way weirder than they think.

3480
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:15,220
And there is something nice about like

3481
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:17,940
not being in that, not having to play that game,

3482
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:20,500
like not having to like optics or, you know,

3483
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:22,940
care about optics or like posture at all.

3484
02:15:22,940 --> 02:15:25,820
If any of these weirder frameworks are real,

3485
02:15:25,820 --> 02:15:28,900
you can't have your talented STEM students

3486
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:31,380
just growing up not thinking they exist.

3487
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:32,940
Like that doesn't work.

3488
02:15:32,940 --> 02:15:35,940
Again, in the world in which like we're at par

3489
02:15:35,940 --> 02:15:39,060
with our adversaries, which you'd have to assume

3490
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:41,020
that we kind of are at least as far as

3491
02:15:41,020 --> 02:15:42,820
the basic existence of the frameworks.

3492
02:15:42,820 --> 02:15:44,380
But that's back to my point about like

3493
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:45,620
the median moves a little bit

3494
02:15:45,620 --> 02:15:49,340
and like the tails move a lot.

3495
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:51,820
Like that's an example of the tail moving a lot.

3496
02:15:51,820 --> 02:15:53,940
And the thing is, you've done venture capital,

3497
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:55,300
you've done investing, you know,

3498
02:15:55,300 --> 02:15:58,860
if you're doing intellectual investing in this sense,

3499
02:15:58,860 --> 02:16:00,220
if you're only paying attention to the mean,

3500
02:16:00,220 --> 02:16:03,220
you're missing the movement on the tail.

3501
02:16:03,220 --> 02:16:06,820
And that is where the dramatic change is happening.

3502
02:16:06,820 --> 02:16:09,340
You have to be looking there and you have to say,

3503
02:16:09,340 --> 02:16:12,580
okay, well, that is a pretty dramatic shift

3504
02:16:12,580 --> 02:16:16,500
that portends an even more dramatic evolution

3505
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:17,820
the next year or two.

3506
02:16:17,860 --> 02:16:20,180
Yeah, and it's like that, you know, like Timur Karand,

3507
02:16:20,180 --> 02:16:22,300
you know, that is this like Duke professor

3508
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:24,180
who talks about like preference falsification.

3509
02:16:24,180 --> 02:16:27,220
And it's always this like very quick cascade.

3510
02:16:27,220 --> 02:16:29,380
So it's not preference falsification,

3511
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:34,060
but it's like, you know, the mean shifting will be,

3512
02:16:34,060 --> 02:16:35,580
you know, very fast.

3513
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:38,260
Like it'll happen at the tail and then it'll like bulge out

3514
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:41,420
and then it'll just like, it'll accelerate much quicker,

3515
02:16:41,420 --> 02:16:43,100
like sort of exponentially quickly.

3516
02:16:43,100 --> 02:16:44,780
And then all of a sudden the mean will be like

3517
02:16:44,780 --> 02:16:47,260
in an entirely different place like after that.

3518
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:49,540
That goes back to the whole like,

3519
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:52,780
you need to have, that can be a disruptive process, right?

3520
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:55,220
Cause like a lot of the social institutions we have

3521
02:16:55,220 --> 02:16:57,300
are framed around like the mean, right?

3522
02:16:57,300 --> 02:16:59,020
It's like everyone believes, you know,

3523
02:16:59,020 --> 02:17:00,380
this is the basic architecture.

3524
02:17:00,380 --> 02:17:02,660
This is the assumptions around next week, next month,

3525
02:17:02,660 --> 02:17:05,500
next year, 20 years, my retirement, my kids,

3526
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:06,460
et cetera, et cetera.

3527
02:17:06,460 --> 02:17:08,340
Like I just did a state planning this morning, right?

3528
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:10,580
It's like very practical trusts,

3529
02:17:10,580 --> 02:17:12,580
how to make sure my kids get what I get, you know?

3530
02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:14,660
It's like, okay, I have to plan 20, 30 years.

3531
02:17:14,660 --> 02:17:15,500
And that's like, okay,

3532
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:17,940
a certain psychological orientation to the future.

3533
02:17:17,940 --> 02:17:19,940
But then you've got this other, these other developments here

3534
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:21,540
and even I who pay very close attention to it,

3535
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:23,460
it's very hard to try to stitch those together.

3536
02:17:23,460 --> 02:17:24,300
Oh, it's extremely hard.

3537
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:26,060
It's like, how do I, you know, I need,

3538
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:26,900
I know I need to do this.

3539
02:17:26,900 --> 02:17:28,420
This is like what I need to do, right?

3540
02:17:28,420 --> 02:17:29,940
But like, I don't really know

3541
02:17:29,940 --> 02:17:31,420
what 20, 30 years is gonna look like.

3542
02:17:31,420 --> 02:17:32,260
Put it all in big time.

3543
02:17:32,260 --> 02:17:34,260
That's an insane, like it's just so much,

3544
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:35,700
it's like a event horizon.

3545
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:37,340
Do you think- Which I can't really see.

3546
02:17:37,340 --> 02:17:39,380
Do you think like, you know,

3547
02:17:39,380 --> 02:17:42,500
I think FDR bought like a huge percentage

3548
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:45,060
of like the gold supply and like put it in Fort Knox

3549
02:17:45,060 --> 02:17:47,620
and then post Bretton Woods,

3550
02:17:47,620 --> 02:17:49,420
this is a total oversimplification,

3551
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:51,500
but you could say that a lot of American foreign policy

3552
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:56,500
was just like governed by the need to

3553
02:17:56,500 --> 02:17:59,580
have somewhat control or like friendly, you know, eyes

3554
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:02,060
on like some percentage of like

3555
02:18:02,060 --> 02:18:03,660
the world's crude oil or something.

3556
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:04,500
Yeah.

3557
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:08,020
Do you think that Bitcoin becomes that now,

3558
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:10,380
especially if you were to get these sort of like

3559
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:11,740
breakthroughs in energy,

3560
02:18:11,740 --> 02:18:13,700
like say you get something weird on the UAP side,

3561
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:15,980
you get some break, you can say you get,

3562
02:18:15,980 --> 02:18:17,620
you know, over unity, you know,

3563
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:19,500
or you get free energy or something,

3564
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:23,140
and you know, fusion works, you know, at scale.

3565
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:27,740
Then would Bitcoin become this like all of a sudden,

3566
02:18:27,740 --> 02:18:30,380
you get this like crazy game theory dynamic over Bitcoin

3567
02:18:30,380 --> 02:18:32,580
where like that becomes the new oil,

3568
02:18:32,580 --> 02:18:34,460
which was the new gold or something.

3569
02:18:34,460 --> 02:18:37,380
Well, yeah, and I think there's a few things.

3570
02:18:37,380 --> 02:18:40,020
One is, I don't think Bitcoin is UAP proof,

3571
02:18:40,020 --> 02:18:41,900
but it might be UAP resistant in that sense.

3572
02:18:41,900 --> 02:18:43,060
I don't think I'm sure you can say anything

3573
02:18:43,700 --> 02:18:45,020
is UAP proof.

3574
02:18:45,020 --> 02:18:46,380
I'd say like disclosure proof,

3575
02:18:46,380 --> 02:18:48,420
maybe is a better way of saying it.

3576
02:18:48,420 --> 02:18:52,340
And like I think I had like a semi-tongue-in-cheek tweet

3577
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:53,740
like four or five years ago that's like,

3578
02:18:53,740 --> 02:18:55,060
what's your UAP hedge?

3579
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:56,180
Hashtag Bitcoin.

3580
02:18:56,180 --> 02:18:58,700
It was a response to this like FT Alpha article

3581
02:18:58,700 --> 02:19:00,580
that was talking about like financial stability risks

3582
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:03,420
associated with UAPs disclosure, right?

3583
02:19:03,420 --> 02:19:05,940
Uncertainty, technological paradigms being changed,

3584
02:19:05,940 --> 02:19:07,820
granted assets, sociological, religious,

3585
02:19:07,820 --> 02:19:09,380
institutional disruptions, et cetera.

3586
02:19:09,380 --> 02:19:11,060
Whole kit and caboodle.

3587
02:19:11,060 --> 02:19:11,900
Which is interesting, right?

3588
02:19:11,900 --> 02:19:12,900
From an investor's perspective,

3589
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:15,300
which is you wanna hold your money for the longterm.

3590
02:19:15,300 --> 02:19:17,660
Most people have a balanced weighted assets

3591
02:19:17,660 --> 02:19:18,740
of like sovereign debt, right?

3592
02:19:18,740 --> 02:19:20,060
Mostly treasury bonds.

3593
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:21,660
Maybe some people have some gold, right?

3594
02:19:21,660 --> 02:19:23,820
It's the old standby in case things get totally crazy.

3595
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:26,180
You've got diversified equity exposure

3596
02:19:26,180 --> 02:19:28,740
to make sure there's any technology changes, right?

3597
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:31,020
New paradigms, whether it's big tech,

3598
02:19:31,020 --> 02:19:33,100
you've got energy utility plays,

3599
02:19:33,100 --> 02:19:35,100
and then maybe you have your flyer 2.5,

3600
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:37,820
two to 5% Bitcoin kind of like thing.

3601
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:40,460
That's probably the new investment sort of,

3602
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:43,140
you know, sort of distribution.

3603
02:19:44,100 --> 02:19:45,580
If you, you know, no one can predict

3604
02:19:45,580 --> 02:19:48,060
what will really come out in terms of technology

3605
02:19:48,060 --> 02:19:52,060
or the diffusion or the rate of change of these paradigms.

3606
02:19:52,060 --> 02:19:55,300
But even if you just get one or two big changes, right?

3607
02:19:55,300 --> 02:19:57,380
Say you do get, not free energy,

3608
02:19:57,380 --> 02:19:58,660
because I don't think that's physically possible

3609
02:19:58,660 --> 02:19:59,500
in the universe.

3610
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:00,420
Let's just think of it as free energy.

3611
02:20:00,420 --> 02:20:02,980
But you get extremely high energy return

3612
02:20:02,980 --> 02:20:04,820
on energy invested sorts of, you know, systems.

3613
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:06,420
Maybe you can draw energy out of the vacuum,

3614
02:20:06,420 --> 02:20:07,780
but there's no such thing as free energy.

3615
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:09,100
You actually have to do some amount of work,

3616
02:20:09,100 --> 02:20:11,140
but it's gonna be like a high payoff

3617
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:12,100
relative to your, you know,

3618
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:14,580
whatever engineering devices you have to put together.

3619
02:20:14,580 --> 02:20:16,300
And we're not even sure if that's physically possible

3620
02:20:16,300 --> 02:20:18,740
because you can do Casimir to just get, you know,

3621
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:22,060
to do this, but that's a reversible process.

3622
02:20:22,060 --> 02:20:24,100
You have to like, you can't develop an engine

3623
02:20:24,100 --> 02:20:27,620
based off of that, at least not to my knowledge.

3624
02:20:28,620 --> 02:20:30,620
But then say you do get something like anti-gravity

3625
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:31,980
or some novel propulsion system

3626
02:20:31,980 --> 02:20:34,180
that allows you to pull forward, say,

3627
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:36,180
the feasibility of asteroid mining at scale

3628
02:20:36,180 --> 02:20:37,260
by 10 or 20 years.

3629
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:38,340
Like that's now on the horizon

3630
02:20:38,340 --> 02:20:39,820
for just conventional propulsion.

3631
02:20:39,820 --> 02:20:41,700
And we know that if you can do asteroid mining,

3632
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:43,740
you can probably get like, you know,

3633
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:45,500
massive amounts of these right now,

3634
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:47,940
very scarce resources don't become scarce anymore.

3635
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:51,820
And, or if you get a ore extraction and refining technology,

3636
02:20:51,820 --> 02:20:54,100
some sort of laser thing that can just, you know,

3637
02:20:54,100 --> 02:20:56,900
blast out of the ore and isolate all the gold.

3638
02:20:56,900 --> 02:20:59,420
Well, maybe you go from a process that right now

3639
02:20:59,420 --> 02:21:01,740
generates 2% of new gold in a year

3640
02:21:01,740 --> 02:21:05,260
and keeps gold as a old standby scarce reserve asset.

3641
02:21:05,260 --> 02:21:08,260
If now you have new technology allows you to create

3642
02:21:08,260 --> 02:21:10,860
five or 10 or 20% new gold every year,

3643
02:21:10,860 --> 02:21:13,300
well, then gold's viability as a reserve asset

3644
02:21:13,300 --> 02:21:15,940
that's scarce enough goes away, right?

3645
02:21:15,940 --> 02:21:17,620
So new technology can finally change

3646
02:21:17,620 --> 02:21:20,900
the sort of monetary predicate of our global system.

3647
02:21:21,780 --> 02:21:23,980
And sovereign debt is sort of what serves

3648
02:21:23,980 --> 02:21:26,660
as the global reserve asset right now.

3649
02:21:26,660 --> 02:21:28,860
And if you read Ray Dalio's new book,

3650
02:21:28,860 --> 02:21:30,340
we're kind of in the sort of end game

3651
02:21:30,340 --> 02:21:32,060
of that kind of sovereign debt crisis

3652
02:21:32,060 --> 02:21:34,100
where we're now paying more on interest

3653
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:36,660
than we do on our defense.

3654
02:21:36,660 --> 02:21:37,900
And we're heading to the point

3655
02:21:38,380 --> 02:21:39,620
where you get this reflexivity where now

3656
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:40,980
the Fed cuts rates on the short end

3657
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:42,540
and the long end goes up by an equivalent

3658
02:21:42,540 --> 02:21:43,380
of maybe even more.

3659
02:21:43,380 --> 02:21:47,580
It's a classic symptom of sort of late stage debt cycles.

3660
02:21:47,580 --> 02:21:49,540
And, you know, it's very hard to get out of those

3661
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:51,060
without essentially monetizing the debt,

3662
02:21:51,060 --> 02:21:52,620
financial oppression, capital controls,

3663
02:21:52,620 --> 02:21:53,580
it's usually what you see, right?

3664
02:21:53,580 --> 02:21:55,900
You have to, you know, inflate the debt away

3665
02:21:55,900 --> 02:21:58,500
or you risk cascading defaults and great depression.

3666
02:21:58,500 --> 02:22:00,620
So you've got to effectively cap rates,

3667
02:22:00,620 --> 02:22:03,300
run the economy hot, try to devalue.

3668
02:22:03,300 --> 02:22:04,820
But the more debt you have,

3669
02:22:04,820 --> 02:22:06,860
the more of a pain you have to impose,

3670
02:22:06,860 --> 02:22:08,340
you've got to isolate sources of capital

3671
02:22:08,340 --> 02:22:10,380
and impose losses on them.

3672
02:22:10,380 --> 02:22:12,180
And so they're gonna be fleeing to,

3673
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:13,660
and that's usually, you know, essentially

3674
02:22:13,660 --> 02:22:16,060
that's the bond market that has to get effectively,

3675
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:18,220
you know, taken out back in shop, right?

3676
02:22:18,220 --> 02:22:20,100
Like, and usually the governments don't forecast that,

3677
02:22:20,100 --> 02:22:22,100
they don't give people clues, it just happens.

3678
02:22:22,100 --> 02:22:24,260
That's how you make sure the sheep are all in the pen

3679
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:26,180
and then you call the herd.

3680
02:22:26,180 --> 02:22:27,860
So you're gonna have to anesthetize

3681
02:22:27,860 --> 02:22:29,780
the global bond market,

3682
02:22:29,780 --> 02:22:32,180
the global sovereign bond market in particular.

3683
02:22:32,180 --> 02:22:33,020
It's not just the US,

3684
02:22:33,020 --> 02:22:35,540
it's basically the whole world at this point.

3685
02:22:35,540 --> 02:22:38,300
And so there's gonna be this movement to,

3686
02:22:38,300 --> 02:22:40,100
you know, harder assets that are harder to do that to,

3687
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:41,060
right, so gold and Bitcoin,

3688
02:22:41,060 --> 02:22:42,860
that's kind of become almost consensus now

3689
02:22:42,860 --> 02:22:45,700
among major institutional investors, Ray Dalio, et cetera.

3690
02:22:45,700 --> 02:22:47,860
You know, I think right now the basic ratio

3691
02:22:47,860 --> 02:22:51,380
is like a five or 10 to one gold to Bitcoin allocation

3692
02:22:51,380 --> 02:22:52,940
in terms of the level of trust,

3693
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:54,340
you know, in the institutional levels

3694
02:22:54,340 --> 02:22:56,180
between gold and Bitcoin.

3695
02:22:56,180 --> 02:22:58,340
But that seems to be the posture, right?

3696
02:22:58,340 --> 02:22:59,420
In fact, there was a story in the FT

3697
02:22:59,420 --> 02:23:04,420
that the London gold vaults are basically being emptied

3698
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:07,500
because a bunch of, you know,

3699
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:09,540
it's all moved to New York essentially

3700
02:23:09,540 --> 02:23:10,380
because they're worried about tariffs

3701
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:12,940
but I think there's other things going on there too.

3702
02:23:12,940 --> 02:23:15,580
So people are repositioning at scale.

3703
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:17,580
In fact, one quick anecdote on that,

3704
02:23:17,580 --> 02:23:22,580
the Swiss army sort of signals intelligence guy

3705
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:25,900
gave a quote to a pretty niche satellite magazine

3706
02:23:25,900 --> 02:23:28,060
several months ago about how they were noticing

3707
02:23:28,060 --> 02:23:30,860
that certain synthetic aperture radar satellites

3708
02:23:30,900 --> 02:23:32,660
that were flown by the US and China

3709
02:23:33,540 --> 02:23:37,540
were intensively monitoring their territory.

3710
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:40,740
It's like, what do you use synthetic aperture satellites

3711
02:23:40,740 --> 02:23:42,620
to do, they're especially X and C.

3712
02:23:42,620 --> 02:23:43,540
Super high resolution.

3713
02:23:43,540 --> 02:23:46,220
Super high resolution since you train mapping

3714
02:23:46,220 --> 02:23:49,700
so you can detect, you know, sub-millimeter deformations

3715
02:23:49,700 --> 02:23:52,260
in say the shape of a mountainside,

3716
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:56,860
the settling of the building or trucks moving in and out.

3717
02:23:56,860 --> 02:23:58,420
So if you are removing large amounts of gold,

3718
02:23:58,420 --> 02:24:00,260
say out of Swiss vaults

3719
02:24:00,620 --> 02:24:01,900
and moving that around the world,

3720
02:24:01,900 --> 02:24:04,540
that would be a thing of acute intelligence collection

3721
02:24:04,540 --> 02:24:06,060
interest to both US and China.

3722
02:24:06,060 --> 02:24:07,220
Where's that gold going?

3723
02:24:07,220 --> 02:24:09,740
You know, gold's hard to track otherwise, right?

3724
02:24:09,740 --> 02:24:12,300
There's no blockchain for gold.

3725
02:24:12,300 --> 02:24:14,060
And a lot, if you look at just the balance

3726
02:24:14,060 --> 02:24:16,620
of disclosed transfers has been a huge amount

3727
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:19,220
of imports to Saudi Arabia from Swiss

3728
02:24:20,300 --> 02:24:21,740
in terms of the gold account.

3729
02:24:21,740 --> 02:24:23,980
So anyways, that's a bit of a sidebar on the monetary side.

3730
02:24:23,980 --> 02:24:24,820
But this is-

3731
02:24:24,820 --> 02:24:25,940
Wait, wait, wait, we gotta close that loop.

3732
02:24:25,940 --> 02:24:26,780
Yes.

3733
02:24:26,780 --> 02:24:28,660
Well, no, so this is, I think-

3734
02:24:28,660 --> 02:24:31,220
Are they trying to sell gold and buy Bitcoin?

3735
02:24:32,140 --> 02:24:33,020
Well, that's a separate question.

3736
02:24:33,020 --> 02:24:36,460
I have heard that in the Emirates, for example,

3737
02:24:36,460 --> 02:24:38,780
explorations of, you know, trying to,

3738
02:24:38,780 --> 02:24:41,860
there's a lot of, say there's a ton of gold

3739
02:24:41,860 --> 02:24:43,820
and other scarce assets, you know, art and whatever

3740
02:24:43,820 --> 02:24:46,980
that has just been tucked away in Swiss vaults.

3741
02:24:46,980 --> 02:24:49,820
Swiss banking secrecy laws have been changing,

3742
02:24:49,820 --> 02:24:52,220
especially after the Russian invasion.

3743
02:24:52,220 --> 02:24:54,020
And essentially, you know, large pools

3744
02:24:54,020 --> 02:24:55,140
of what you call shadow wealth

3745
02:24:55,140 --> 02:24:57,540
is no longer feeling safe in Switzerland.

3746
02:24:57,580 --> 02:24:59,460
So they're trying to go back home, right?

3747
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:02,900
In Saudi Arabia, in the Emirates or other wealth countries

3748
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:05,740
or in Asia and Singapore, Hong Kong, et cetera.

3749
02:25:05,740 --> 02:25:08,020
And so there's been a reconfiguration of where, say,

3750
02:25:08,020 --> 02:25:10,300
the hidden wealth of the world wants to go.

3751
02:25:10,300 --> 02:25:11,540
And they're realizing now that actually,

3752
02:25:11,540 --> 02:25:13,500
if you just want to hold gold in a Swiss vault

3753
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:15,260
for a hundred years, it's been great, right?

3754
02:25:15,260 --> 02:25:16,740
But at the moment, you realize it could be seized

3755
02:25:16,740 --> 02:25:20,460
or sanctioned as a new risk premium attached to it.

3756
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:21,340
And then you want to move it.

3757
02:25:21,340 --> 02:25:23,780
Well, it's super expensive to move, right?

3758
02:25:23,780 --> 02:25:24,620
It's extremely expensive.

3759
02:25:24,620 --> 02:25:25,580
And then actually you'd be like,

3760
02:25:25,580 --> 02:25:28,500
oh, well, if I could just sell the gold by Bitcoin,

3761
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:30,060
I can then teleport the Bitcoin

3762
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:33,580
and maybe buy back gold, essentially,

3763
02:25:33,580 --> 02:25:35,780
there with a local importer.

3764
02:25:35,780 --> 02:25:36,900
And maybe that fee, actually,

3765
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:38,500
that transaction cost is cheaper

3766
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:40,740
than actually physically transporting the gold.

3767
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:41,860
But then if you're doing that,

3768
02:25:41,860 --> 02:25:45,260
you might be convinced to just keep five or 10% of that

3769
02:25:45,260 --> 02:25:47,020
in Bitcoin along the way, right?

3770
02:25:47,020 --> 02:25:49,740
Oh, maybe I don't sell it all back into gold, right?

3771
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:51,740
That's an extra convert, that's an extra transaction fee.

3772
02:25:51,740 --> 02:25:53,540
Maybe I'll keep some of it in Bitcoin, right?

3773
02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:55,380
So I think that is happening now.

3774
02:25:56,180 --> 02:25:57,020
There's institutions, I think,

3775
02:25:57,020 --> 02:25:57,840
being set up in the Middle East

3776
02:25:57,840 --> 02:25:59,020
to facilitate that type of trade.

3777
02:25:59,020 --> 02:26:00,980
Do you think you see game theory play out

3778
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:02,620
on the global scale with Bitcoin?

3779
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:07,060
So you have smaller players like Bukele of El Salvador,

3780
02:26:07,060 --> 02:26:09,060
who I think would buy Bitcoin tomorrow,

3781
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:13,300
and you hear rumors about stuff in Saudi Arabia as well.

3782
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:15,060
But I think they're kind of waiting for the US

3783
02:26:15,060 --> 02:26:17,260
to kind of take the lead on some of these things.

3784
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:22,020
So if we create a strategic Federal Reserve

3785
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:25,020
or a strategic Bitcoin Reserve,

3786
02:26:25,060 --> 02:26:27,380
does that sort of tee off this,

3787
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:29,660
every other country needs to kind of get in line

3788
02:26:29,660 --> 02:26:31,700
and get coordinated on their Bitcoin policy

3789
02:26:31,700 --> 02:26:33,900
and start to buy it?

3790
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:35,980
Yes, I think that is happening,

3791
02:26:35,980 --> 02:26:37,680
but in a very nascent and very,

3792
02:26:38,820 --> 02:26:40,780
everyone's looking around sort of stage.

3793
02:26:40,780 --> 02:26:43,060
Nobody's bolted out to be at first at the door stage,

3794
02:26:43,060 --> 02:26:45,020
but everyone is definitely looking around.

3795
02:26:45,020 --> 02:26:47,220
I was in Abu Dhabi, I don't know,

3796
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:49,220
two months ago for a Bitcoin conference there,

3797
02:26:49,220 --> 02:26:51,180
and it was more like a geopolitical summit

3798
02:26:51,180 --> 02:26:52,940
than an industry conference, right?

3799
02:26:52,940 --> 02:26:56,700
There were delegations sent there from multiple nations,

3800
02:26:56,700 --> 02:26:59,620
like GCC nations,

3801
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:03,300
and their explicit mission from their national leadership,

3802
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:04,780
reporting directly back to the king,

3803
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:06,340
the minister of finance, the central bank head,

3804
02:27:06,340 --> 02:27:08,460
was what does this new administration

3805
02:27:08,460 --> 02:27:09,500
really think about Bitcoin?

3806
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:11,580
How serious are they about shifting

3807
02:27:11,580 --> 02:27:12,940
in a pro-Bitcoin direction?

3808
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:14,700
And not just on the strategic Bitcoin Reserve idea,

3809
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:16,980
but just in general doing this 180

3810
02:27:16,980 --> 02:27:18,580
that we're sort of seeing in motion.

3811
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:20,060
And then what will that mean?

3812
02:27:20,060 --> 02:27:22,780
Again, these governments, they're not traders.

3813
02:27:23,620 --> 02:27:25,620
They're not trying to like time the trade.

3814
02:27:25,620 --> 02:27:28,100
This is a strategic orientation

3815
02:27:28,100 --> 02:27:29,220
they're trying to anticipate.

3816
02:27:29,220 --> 02:27:32,740
Well, how serious do you think the American government is now,

3817
02:27:32,740 --> 02:27:35,300
the new incoming administration when it comes to Bitcoin?

3818
02:27:35,300 --> 02:27:36,140
They're very serious.

3819
02:27:36,140 --> 02:27:37,380
I mean, Trump has said explicitly,

3820
02:27:37,380 --> 02:27:42,380
and he's, you know, about US being crypto capital of the world.

3821
02:27:43,220 --> 02:27:46,020
He's very serious about this pro-Bitcoin policy.

3822
02:27:46,020 --> 02:27:49,220
We'll see what that manifests practically

3823
02:27:49,220 --> 02:27:50,580
in terms of, say, executive orders.

3824
02:27:50,580 --> 02:27:51,420
We have this working group

3825
02:27:52,220 --> 02:27:56,660
this issue of a stockpile of digital assets,

3826
02:27:56,660 --> 02:28:00,140
most likely just Bitcoin, and also stable coins, right?

3827
02:28:00,140 --> 02:28:02,060
So though I think strategically there's a synergy

3828
02:28:02,060 --> 02:28:04,300
between stable coins, essentially dollar pegged

3829
02:28:04,300 --> 02:28:06,180
crypto euro dollars that trade offshore

3830
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:09,020
on open blockchains mostly,

3831
02:28:09,020 --> 02:28:12,820
and are essentially like IOUs in crypto world

3832
02:28:12,820 --> 02:28:14,020
denominated in dollars, right?

3833
02:28:14,020 --> 02:28:16,020
So they function just as like a dollar,

3834
02:28:16,020 --> 02:28:17,380
but you know, on an open blockchain.

3835
02:28:17,380 --> 02:28:19,780
And these will be mostly Ethereum based, you think?

3836
02:28:19,780 --> 02:28:21,020
So yeah, there's some, yeah.

3837
02:28:21,660 --> 02:28:24,300
Well, Ethereum, a Tron is a very popular,

3838
02:28:24,300 --> 02:28:28,260
but there's a, now that was like very nascent.

3839
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:31,820
I think now there's a lot of focus on the regulatory side

3840
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:35,980
to pass laws that would allow say banks to issue stable coins

3841
02:28:35,980 --> 02:28:36,980
and get in on the game.

3842
02:28:36,980 --> 02:28:39,340
And that would, you know, create this regulatory perimeter

3843
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:41,380
to essentially expand the dollar network.

3844
02:28:41,380 --> 02:28:42,580
Stable coins also have this feature

3845
02:28:42,580 --> 02:28:45,060
where if they're properly regulated as they would be,

3846
02:28:45,060 --> 02:28:47,220
you know, forced to under this law

3847
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:49,180
would be fully reserved, right?

3848
02:28:49,180 --> 02:28:50,460
With high quality liquid assets,

3849
02:28:50,500 --> 02:28:53,060
specifically treasury securities, most likely short term.

3850
02:28:53,060 --> 02:28:55,260
But if they're banks, they could actually term that out.

3851
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:56,980
So you'd have new buyers of, you know,

3852
02:28:56,980 --> 02:28:58,780
basically it's a new balance sheet capacity

3853
02:28:58,780 --> 02:29:00,460
to absorb new government debt.

3854
02:29:00,460 --> 02:29:01,980
So you expand stable coins around the world,

3855
02:29:01,980 --> 02:29:04,020
which are right now about 200 trillion,

3856
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:06,060
sorry, 200 billion, right?

3857
02:29:06,060 --> 02:29:09,300
They're about 2.5% of the T-bill market.

3858
02:29:09,300 --> 02:29:11,260
I think it's very plausible if they pass this legislation

3859
02:29:11,260 --> 02:29:13,700
within a few years, you could see that tax.

3860
02:29:13,700 --> 02:29:15,220
And then just stable coins themselves

3861
02:29:15,220 --> 02:29:17,220
are basically giving the US government

3862
02:29:17,220 --> 02:29:19,420
25% of their role on the short end.

3863
02:29:20,540 --> 02:29:21,580
What do you mean by that?

3864
02:29:21,580 --> 02:29:25,180
Meaning about 25% of their annual financing capacity,

3865
02:29:25,180 --> 02:29:28,340
well, like requirements for short-term bill issuance

3866
02:29:28,340 --> 02:29:31,460
would be absorbed by the stable coin issuers

3867
02:29:32,820 --> 02:29:34,580
that have to reserve the expansion

3868
02:29:34,580 --> 02:29:37,500
of the stable coin sort of issuance.

3869
02:29:37,500 --> 02:29:38,340
You know, it's an IOU,

3870
02:29:38,340 --> 02:29:39,940
they have to have an asset to back that up, right?

3871
02:29:39,940 --> 02:29:41,940
Viability asset matching.

3872
02:29:41,940 --> 02:29:43,340
And so you expand the dollar network,

3873
02:29:43,340 --> 02:29:45,260
again, you're sort of penetrating parts of the global South

3874
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:46,980
that don't have access to correspondent banks

3875
02:29:46,980 --> 02:29:49,340
where remittances and, you know, Western Union

3876
02:29:49,380 --> 02:29:50,380
are very expensive.

3877
02:29:50,380 --> 02:29:51,980
And so this would just be like an accelerant

3878
02:29:51,980 --> 02:29:53,820
for I think global development,

3879
02:29:53,820 --> 02:29:55,980
as well as the expansion of the dollar network

3880
02:29:55,980 --> 02:29:58,620
helps the US government on the margin finance itself.

3881
02:29:58,620 --> 02:30:00,340
So kind of win, win, win.

3882
02:30:00,340 --> 02:30:02,580
And Bitcoin to first order is what drives the expansion

3883
02:30:02,580 --> 02:30:04,860
of the global sort of stable coin market.

3884
02:30:04,860 --> 02:30:07,140
It's what you use to trade in and out of Bitcoin.

3885
02:30:07,140 --> 02:30:09,540
And so if the unit price of Bitcoin is, you know,

3886
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:11,820
much higher, you need much more stable coins

3887
02:30:11,820 --> 02:30:13,420
to just facilitate that trade,

3888
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:16,380
let alone the additional activities in the crypto ecosystem,

3889
02:30:16,380 --> 02:30:19,300
some of which are more speculative than others.

3890
02:30:20,140 --> 02:30:22,220
And so, yeah, you can see the synergistic flywheel

3891
02:30:22,220 --> 02:30:23,700
developed between Bitcoin and stable coins

3892
02:30:23,700 --> 02:30:25,900
that starts to take on a geopolitical dimension.

3893
02:30:25,900 --> 02:30:27,340
And then Bitcoin is, you know,

3894
02:30:27,340 --> 02:30:29,980
seen right now essentially as a speculative reserve asset

3895
02:30:29,980 --> 02:30:31,420
that's complimentary to gold,

3896
02:30:31,420 --> 02:30:33,380
but because it's much more volatile, right?

3897
02:30:33,380 --> 02:30:36,020
It's prudently, you know, risk weighted, right?

3898
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:38,860
As a much smaller proportion of your overall portfolio

3899
02:30:38,860 --> 02:30:41,980
in say a sovereign wealth, you know, portfolio.

3900
02:30:41,980 --> 02:30:44,100
But it is now like a non-zero thing, right?

3901
02:30:44,100 --> 02:30:47,060
And so as its total value likely increases,

3902
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:48,460
its volatility likely decreases,

3903
02:30:48,460 --> 02:30:50,020
therefore its risk weighted, you know,

3904
02:30:50,020 --> 02:30:51,540
allocation should rationally go up.

3905
02:30:51,540 --> 02:30:53,860
So it's just like sort of positive feedback loop.

3906
02:30:53,860 --> 02:30:56,020
Yeah, and so actually the Bitcoin Policy Institute,

3907
02:30:56,020 --> 02:30:58,820
the organization I'm proud to now help lead,

3908
02:30:58,820 --> 02:31:00,500
actually has a fellow named Matthew Ferranti,

3909
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:05,500
who's a economist, trained PhD at Harvard under Ken Rogoff,

3910
02:31:06,100 --> 02:31:08,500
who's an economist for the US intelligence community.

3911
02:31:08,500 --> 02:31:09,940
And he's written a white paper for us,

3912
02:31:09,940 --> 02:31:11,300
which is the case for Bitcoin

3913
02:31:11,300 --> 02:31:14,700
as a central bank reserve asset.

3914
02:31:15,580 --> 02:31:17,340
So I would encourage folks to read.

3915
02:31:18,020 --> 02:31:20,100
Is Satoshi either rolling in his grave

3916
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:22,940
or extremely pissed off at that prospect?

3917
02:31:22,940 --> 02:31:24,460
This is the thing, is like, you know,

3918
02:31:24,460 --> 02:31:26,140
eventually Bitcoin is now,

3919
02:31:26,140 --> 02:31:28,820
is gonna play the geopolitical in the sovereign level.

3920
02:31:28,820 --> 02:31:30,460
And it does open up these larger questions.

3921
02:31:30,460 --> 02:31:32,020
Okay, Bitcoin is non-state money,

3922
02:31:32,020 --> 02:31:34,100
but when states start to hold it, what happens to Bitcoin?

3923
02:31:34,100 --> 02:31:35,100
Yeah, totally.

3924
02:31:35,100 --> 02:31:36,860
And then also you get this wealth transfer,

3925
02:31:36,860 --> 02:31:38,380
so that's like this really interesting thing.

3926
02:31:38,380 --> 02:31:41,780
But it is sort of anathema to like the initial, you know,

3927
02:31:41,780 --> 02:31:43,180
spirit maybe.

3928
02:31:43,180 --> 02:31:44,980
I mean, you can say that you read the early forums

3929
02:31:45,020 --> 02:31:47,700
and how Finney was calling for a Bitcoin price of 10 million

3930
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:49,060
and thought that states would buy it

3931
02:31:49,060 --> 02:31:51,220
and it would just be like a global money, right?

3932
02:31:51,220 --> 02:31:53,660
And the question is, the argument was more,

3933
02:31:53,660 --> 02:31:56,860
is there a central issuer that can control the supply

3934
02:31:56,860 --> 02:31:59,100
or censor transactions, right?

3935
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:00,700
The government owning Bitcoin

3936
02:32:00,700 --> 02:32:02,340
does not change the supply of Bitcoin,

3937
02:32:02,340 --> 02:32:05,740
it doesn't restrict anybody's ability to transact.

3938
02:32:05,740 --> 02:32:07,060
They're just a participant in the network

3939
02:32:07,060 --> 02:32:09,780
like anybody else, and they're subject to,

3940
02:32:09,780 --> 02:32:12,460
it's rule set as much as everybody else's, right?

3941
02:32:12,460 --> 02:32:14,420
And so this is the thing, you gotta,

3942
02:32:14,460 --> 02:32:16,300
there are more second order effects though

3943
02:32:16,300 --> 02:32:17,620
that are important to assess.

3944
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:18,900
And as BPI will think,

3945
02:32:18,900 --> 02:32:20,620
we'll be taking a very close look at these,

3946
02:32:20,620 --> 02:32:22,660
which is more on the nuance associated

3947
02:32:22,660 --> 02:32:24,580
with the development ecosystem,

3948
02:32:24,580 --> 02:32:25,980
which is this rough consensus model,

3949
02:32:25,980 --> 02:32:27,140
you've got Bitcoin developers,

3950
02:32:27,140 --> 02:32:29,060
you've got kind of this community of folks

3951
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:31,500
that are very invested in Bitcoin technical development.

3952
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:33,780
And there's always a lot of, you know, conversations of,

3953
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:36,060
you know, it's an open source money project, right?

3954
02:32:36,060 --> 02:32:37,580
There's just code, right?

3955
02:32:37,580 --> 02:32:39,660
And so it's like what sorts of BIPs,

3956
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:42,540
Bitcoin improvement proposals are gonna be considered.

3957
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:46,060
And, you know, that conversation was happening

3958
02:32:46,060 --> 02:32:48,220
at some levels, and then there's big companies

3959
02:32:48,220 --> 02:32:50,460
that get involved, and that potentially changes

3960
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:51,700
some of the inherent dynamics

3961
02:32:51,700 --> 02:32:53,100
associated with that consensus model.

3962
02:32:53,100 --> 02:32:55,980
Now you've got, say, Bitcoin miners are a big constituency.

3963
02:32:55,980 --> 02:32:58,500
There are certain things that they would rather see

3964
02:32:58,500 --> 02:32:59,500
versus other things.

3965
02:32:59,500 --> 02:33:02,260
Whereas the individual user or developer or custodian,

3966
02:33:02,260 --> 02:33:05,140
like they all have their own interests in Bitcoin, right?

3967
02:33:05,140 --> 02:33:06,100
And those are gonna be reflected

3968
02:33:06,100 --> 02:33:08,500
in the kind of the dynamic political economy of Bitcoin.

3969
02:33:08,500 --> 02:33:10,220
And now states, right, as they buy Bitcoin,

3970
02:33:10,220 --> 02:33:11,860
they're gonna have a view, right?

3971
02:33:12,140 --> 02:33:13,540
And there's no monopoly power,

3972
02:33:13,540 --> 02:33:15,980
but now there's some multi-level bargaining

3973
02:33:15,980 --> 02:33:17,500
about, you know, the future

3974
02:33:17,500 --> 02:33:18,820
of this open source money project, right?

3975
02:33:18,820 --> 02:33:21,260
And the game theory of Bitcoin has always been,

3976
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:23,940
the incentives always align in a positive direction

3977
02:33:23,940 --> 02:33:25,700
that works to Bitcoin's benefit, right?

3978
02:33:25,700 --> 02:33:29,100
Like the miners and the users and the algorithm

3979
02:33:29,100 --> 02:33:31,300
are essentially, they structure the game theory

3980
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:33,460
of the incentives around this protocol

3981
02:33:33,460 --> 02:33:35,580
that makes it a stable system, right?

3982
02:33:35,580 --> 02:33:37,820
And so, again, I have no crystal ball,

3983
02:33:37,820 --> 02:33:39,820
but that's what you gotta, you know,

3984
02:33:39,820 --> 02:33:41,620
that's why it's not already 10 million, right?

3985
02:33:41,620 --> 02:33:43,700
Is because there's some inherent uncertainty and risk.

3986
02:33:43,700 --> 02:33:44,980
If everyone knew that it was gonna become

3987
02:33:44,980 --> 02:33:49,300
a global reserve asset seamlessly from here to 2040,

3988
02:33:49,300 --> 02:33:51,260
then that would be priced in, right?

3989
02:33:51,260 --> 02:33:53,660
It's clearly the market has some uncertainty about that,

3990
02:33:53,660 --> 02:33:54,500
right?

3991
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:56,580
And we're gonna see on a path dependent basis,

3992
02:33:56,580 --> 02:33:58,180
like how it actually evolves.

3993
02:33:58,180 --> 02:34:00,220
Well, it seems like a pretty constructive setup,

3994
02:34:00,220 --> 02:34:03,140
both for Bitcoin and for UAP.

3995
02:34:03,140 --> 02:34:06,380
And we'll see where things go from here.

3996
02:34:06,380 --> 02:34:07,780
And I really appreciate your time, Matt.

3997
02:34:07,780 --> 02:34:11,580
It's always a pleasure and an honor and a lot of fun.

3998
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:13,380
Yeah, of course.

3999
02:34:13,380 --> 02:34:14,220
All right.
