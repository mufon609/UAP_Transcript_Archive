1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,880
Over the last 48 hours, I read your entire book, The Extra Tempestrial Model, blew my

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,880
mind.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,880
Awesome.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:22,100
I think it is, it makes so much sense and you do such a good job of laying out probably

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:29,860
the most reasonable explanation I've ever heard to these alien abduction accounts and

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,620
these UFO experiences that people have with beings.

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,140
Can you sort of just like lay out how you got into this whole thing and how you got

8
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,140
interested in this?

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,740
Yeah, no, it's kind of a long and winding road to say the least.

10
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,460
This started similar to a lot of people's experience with the cover of Whitley Strieber's

11
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,460
book.

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,300
Right, right back there.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,180
As you have displayed on your shelf, it was sitting out just like that on, in the house

14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,700
I grew up in, it was sitting on a living room shelf, faced out just like that, maybe as

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,620
a conversational piece, I don't know, because my biological father saw a UFO late at night

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,620
with another individual.

17
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,580
He was a veterinarian in rural Ohio, kind of northeast Amish country, and he described

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,580
it as this ball of light.

19
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,460
It wasn't emitting rays, like you look at a street light and it's kind of got the rays

20
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,540
coming out, but he said him and this colleague crested a hill, they could see it off in the

21
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,260
distance, not too far, maybe five, six hundred meters or so, and then all of a sudden it

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,580
shot toward their truck, hovered there above them for a little bit, shot back across the

23
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,780
horizon, maybe another five or six seconds and straight up into the sky at tremendous

24
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,780
speed.

25
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,340
And I overheard him telling this story to some friends at our house, I was kind of sneaking

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,660
downstairs late at night because there was stuff going on and I was like an eight year

27
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,980
old kid, so I was curious what was happening, it was right around that time that Whitley's

28
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,820
book came out, he got it, it was on the living room shelf, and there were a number of things

29
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,540
about that, just hearing the account to start with, like A, it's Amish country, there's

30
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:09,500
no lights, Amish don't use lights, B, it's not moving like any conventional craft, C,

31
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,940
he's talking about UFOs, never heard of that, that piqued my interest, but even beyond that,

32
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,980
when I walked into the living room and saw that book on the shelf, it sort of triggered

33
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,740
this image in my head, and I described this in both my first two books, because it was

34
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,540
the origin point for this little rabbit hole that I've spent my entire life going down

35
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:38,460
pretty much, where I imagined or saw in my mind's eye an early hominin form, like a chimpanzee,

36
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,500
in the middle was this modern human form, I put it on a koozie too, and then on the

37
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,980
right was this quintessential alien, like on the cover of Whitley's book, and obviously

38
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,740
that's kind of a cheeky character of what I saw, but it gets the point across, and it

39
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,020
got the point across to me, that's all it took, and I had this sort of awareness or

40
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,140
this thought, what if we're all related, what if we look like we do because we came from

41
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,980
this early primitive form, and what if we go on to look like them in our future, and

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,540
it sort of shaped the rest of my life from that point, I chose the majors I did in college

43
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,640
to look into this further, I did the research that I did as part of my graduate work and

44
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,940
even after graduate school in my normal anthropological career, looking at craniofacial anatomy, human

45
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,380
evolution, how the eye interacts with the brain and the face in a functional sense,

46
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,540
in a biomedical sense, but also just how all of these things change together, and what

47
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,980
if we project that forward, these same dominant trends that characterize the last six to eight

48
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,340
million years, project those forward, are we going to look like them, and then it obviously

49
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,900
went a lot further into other fields, but that was sort of the impetus for it, that's

50
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,220
what got me started.

51
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,860
So how long did you study biological anthropo- I don't know how to say it.

52
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,940
Yeah, biological anthropology, it used to be called physical anthropology, which was

53
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,940
way easier to pronounce.

54
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,940
Anthropology.

55
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,380
Yeah, it's anthropology.

56
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,140
Biological anthropology, easy for you to say.

57
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,460
Yeah, well, physical was easier, but actually it was just about four or five years ago that

58
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:19,740
we changed from the APAA to the ABAA, the American Biological, yeah, it doesn't really

59
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:24,340
matter, but I don't know why we did that, honestly, because there's been physical anthropology

60
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,900
for a century, and all of a sudden we're the American Association of Biological Anthropologists,

61
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,580
so I screwed that up.

62
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,180
And how long did you study it for, what kind of degree do you have in there?

63
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:42,340
I got a PhD, I started out in physics and astronomy because I was interested in the

64
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,540
are these time machines question, and I was going to pursue that.

65
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,220
And then my sophomore year, I remember it vividly, I was standing behind Morton Hall,

66
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:58,020
which is the physics and astronomy lecture hall, the actual department was located elsewhere,

67
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,460
and yeah, I was just standing back there by myself, and all of a sudden it was like, you

68
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:09,340
know, this kind of drive to switch, like what if we looked at the biological side, what

69
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,380
if we looked at the beans instead of the craft?

70
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,660
And from that point on, I switched my major, and yeah, it's been great, I've gotten to

71
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,020
travel the world, work at archaeological sites, three and a half million year old site in

72
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,980
Makhpansgarh, South Africa, for two seasons, a Neanderthal site in Shapenoa, Jeansak, in

73
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:33,500
the Bordeaux region of southern France, and yeah, go all over the world and study skulls,

74
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,300
and it's been fun, even outside of this underlying question of could they be us?

75
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,060
Where are we going morphologically?

76
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,380
But it's just, it's a really interesting field in general, I find it fascinating.

77
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:53,340
To you, what is the most compelling evidence that these typical alien beings that we see,

78
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,740
like for instance, on the cover of Whitley's book, are us?

79
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,220
Well, I mean, perhaps I'm biased in the sense that this is what I've been looking at since

80
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,060
I was eight or nine, like I wasn't going and digging up bones and measuring them or anything

81
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:16,900
back then, but I had sort of been thinking about this, and obviously switched my major

82
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:23,900
to study this, and it was more about, it's hard because we're at a place now where we

83
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,620
say, well, we have cockpit videos of the craft, we've acknowledged those, there's still debates

84
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,940
about what they might be, you know, is it lens flare or some other, seagulls, swamp

85
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:42,300
gas has been a common one throughout history, but the question of who's inside is still

86
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,220
kind of on the fringe, but to me, I don't see it that way.

87
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:53,340
I think at least as far as what I've been looking at, that's the best evidence of future

88
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,340
humans, the craft themselves, and we could talk about this as well if you want, do seem

89
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,940
to have a form consistent with the function of manipulating space-time and creating closed

90
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:09,940
timeline curves, so there's a technological continuity aspect too, but for me and my research,

91
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:18,060
it's the extremely ubiquitous description of a humanoid form, and I've said a million

92
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:24,280
times if what got out of these craft was, you know, an eight-legged squid-spider type

93
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,140
of creature, never would have got into this, but they're so consistently described in very

94
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:37,140
hominid terms, bilateral symmetry, two gut openings, eyes, nose, mouth in the same location,

95
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,180
pentadactyly having five digits at the end of each limb, four limbs in general, tetrapods

96
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:48,020
going back 400 million years, and then characteristics indicative of the continuation of long-standing

97
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,780
trends on this planet, going back six to eight million years ago since we stood upright,

98
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:59,660
bigger heads, larger eyes, smaller faces, less hair, thin bodies, less pigmentation

99
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,220
to their skin, just this incredible suite of characteristics that seem to indicate that

100
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,400
they're not just related to us phylogenetically, but they are part of the hominin clade and

101
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,260
specifically toward the future of where we are now.

102
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,380
With that said, there is obviously variation. There's a lot of variation in what people

103
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,380
describe.

104
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,340
Yeah, some people describe four fingers, right? Like, Willie, I think, said that.

105
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,060
Yeah, and that could be very much an atrophy of our fifth digit. The fifth phalanges just

106
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,420
maybe shrinks down. I don't know. It's pretty small, and also maybe I have especially small

107
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,420
pink hair.

108
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:37,660
My pinky toe is, like, almost not there. It's so tiny. It's, like...

109
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,060
You're the future, man. You got to get out there and reproduce. You're at least going

110
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,060
to get us into there.

111
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,980
Yeah, I'm saying I could be, like, maybe a hybrid or something.

112
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:52,700
I wouldn't doubt it. Some look into it, for sure. And, you know, there are... There's

113
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,780
variation not just in the physical form, like we're talking about, in us, but there's variation

114
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:04,780
in what's described, what people see. So I don't think this theory explains all of it,

115
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:12,860
but I do think it explains the humanoid forms with the extenuation of traits indicative

116
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,260
of our hominid past. And I also point out, I wasn't aware of this when I published my

117
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:22,300
first book, unfortunately, but the Dr. Edgar Mitchell free study at the time surveyed something

118
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:30,300
like 3,200 contactees and abductees as well, so individuals who have been on the ships.

119
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,340
And they asked them specifically if they had observed non-human intelligence, and they

120
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,900
used that term, NHI, non-human intelligence, which biases the question. So they should

121
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,460
have used a different one, something more... Something less leading, I guess you should

122
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,580
say. And it's hard with surveys, you know, because you're trying to get people to think

123
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,580
about, well, what was it, and put in those terms, and that's the common term. But much

124
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,100
like extraterrestrial, we should kind of pull back from that and use terminology that is

125
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,060
less leading. I'm with Whitley. I use visitor, traveler, things like that more recently to

126
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,380
advocate for that as well. So anyway, what they found is individuals who are taken on

127
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,700
these ships, the majority saw humans. They described them as human, even though the question

128
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,780
specifically asked non-human intelligence. So just like us. After that, the next most

129
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:26,100
common was the short grays, and then the tall grays, and then hybrids rounded it out. About

130
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,020
5% were non-hominin forms, something like apparitions or these mantis-type beans. And

131
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,220
I always point out, too, that with the mantids, if they have four limbs, they're still more

132
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,060
in the hominin clade than they would be in an insect, which has six limbs. So that's

133
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:48,180
an important distinction, too. But my point is that based on the definition of a hominin,

134
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,180
an upright walking primate, we're in the primate order. We stand up on two limbs. We're not

135
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,220
only the only primate that does that. We're the only mammal on this planet that habitually

136
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,780
walks on two limbs. We're the only biped. I think there's a compelling point in your

137
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:11,220
book. You mentioned that there's two million catalogued species on Earth, and 20 of them

138
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:22,580
are hominids, and one of those 20 are upright walking hominids. And it was like .001% are

139
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:28,140
the upright walking hominids. And then we are the ones who generated the technology

140
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,760
that could get off the planet. Yeah, and even ask these questions. So just looking at how

141
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:41,120
rare, or how we don't know, it could be non-existent, life is in the universe apart from us, just

142
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,240
how rare we are on this planet that is so packed with life. How would we know that life

143
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,960
would be anything resembling what we are anywhere else in the world? Especially if a lot of

144
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,960
the other worlds that are out there in Goldilocks zones that are habitable for life are mostly

145
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,360
water worlds. What would animals look like in water worlds? Not like us.

146
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,280
That's a great point. And there's so many other variables to the distance from their sun. Are

147
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,960
they in a singular binary star system? Are they nitrogen-based or carbon-based like we are? Do

148
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,400
they have anything even closer resembling DNA? What are the chances they would get AGCT in the

149
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:27,240
same nucleotide linkages that we have that structures all life on this planet? Some viruses

150
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,720
have RNA, but they're not living because they need something else to replicate in a host,

151
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,680
but every other living organism on this planet, I'll get in trouble for that because some people

152
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,320
think viruses are alive and I get a lot of hate mail. Do they really? Yeah. That and free

153
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,680
will. If I say viruses aren't alive, or they're not living organisms, and I say some about free

154
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,960
will, I get a lot of hate mail, but I'm used to it at this point. Anyway, it's not just all of

155
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,720
these other variables, whether they be celestial, do they have a moon? Do they have a large planet

156
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,760
like Jupiter that sucks up all of the asteroids that would hit them otherwise like we do? We're

157
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,800
so fortunate here in our solar system, but even outside of that, I did a study in 2016 looking at

158
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,480
all of the planets that have been found as part of the Kepler mission, and based on the stats of

159
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:20,120
planetary size, their mass, only 2.2% of them were the same size or smaller than Earth. I redid it

160
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,800
in 2022 with new data, we're up to over 5,000, but we're pretty close to six or seven now,

161
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,200
based on the planetary habitability study from the University of Puerto Rico,

162
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,080
Arecibo, one of the big dish that collapsed a couple years ago. Right, right. Yeah, what was

163
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:41,680
the story with that Arecibo? It was a signal that we sent out? Yeah, we sent, I think it was in the

164
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,000
70s, maybe it was our first big broadcast. There was some debate, like, should we be broadcasting

165
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,600
our existence here? Because we could, you know, bring in all of these evil extraterrestrials that

166
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,620
want to treat us like we treated people and we discovered other civilizations on this planet.

167
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,720
I think Hawkein was one of the big proponents of that. But the point of doing the study was

168
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:09,800
to show, in concert with what Dr. Latimer, who used to be the director of the Cleveland Museum

169
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,360
of Natural History, called the perils of being bipedal. We suffer from all kinds of problems with

170
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,720
our necks, our backs, difficulty in childbirth, blown out knees, hernias, varicose veins, hemorrhoids,

171
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,880
all of these problems we suffer from are the direct result of standing upright. But the benefits

172
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:34,040
that we get from standing upright outweigh the costs that come with bipedalism. But it is rare

173
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:41,560
here, like you said, we're the only ones that do it habitually. And if it's rare here, based on the

174
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,600
fact that between two and four and a half percent of all other planets that we've identified so far,

175
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:55,000
which is a decent sample, are much, much larger than Earth. And it's hard to do here on a very

176
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,280
small planet, relatively speaking, with only 9.8 meters per second squared of gravity, the acceleration

177
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:07,240
pulling down on us. It's going to be very, very unlikely on any other planet based on the limited

178
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,880
sample that we have. But if we can extrapolate that out, it's not likely that you're going to

179
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,960
get bipedalism on other planets. So even in addition to all these other factors that you've

180
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,320
mentioned, and I threw in some on top of just the fact that they're bipedal, they're reported as

181
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,240
being bipedal in almost every case, I think is an indication that we have a phylogenetic relationship.

182
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,960
When I'm down on all fours, it's only because I've dropped my Mando in the shower. Otherwise, Danny's

183
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,120
a bipedal walking scent machine that dusts each room with bourbon leather in such volume that suggests

184
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,280
he applies it more often than a teenage jock who just discovered that girls don't wink at the stink.

185
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,520
You've heard me talk about Mando before. And when I was stranded on an island for 13 days with no

186
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,640
water, a bearded man walked up to me and scrubbed my whole body with this mysterious bar and said,

187
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,560
thou shall be taken care of for 72 hours. It's clinically proven. Yeah, I couldn't believe it

188
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,680
either. But it turns out it's aluminum free, baking soda free, cruelty free and vegan. And it's

189
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,720
developed by a doctor who saw that people were misdiagnosed with BO. And he said, I shall save

190
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,000
thou pits and packages. There he is. That's him. That's the island bearded Mando man. Mando comes

191
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,200
in four manly flavors, bourbon leather, clover woods, Mount Fuji and pro sport. What is that

192
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,040
you got there, Danny? I got the Mando bourbon leather right here. This is what I scrub my bum

193
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,000
with every day. If you like Danny, Danny likes me and I like you, then that's just a coincidental

194
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,480
bonus to what it's like to have Mando radiating from the happy moist cracks of your body. The

195
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,320
other day I was doing some jujitsu in this hot fort of heat and I got this really big guy in a

196
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,880
leg lock. Then he complimented my butt for smelling so pretty. In fact, I smelled so pleasant. It gave

197
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,680
him the strength to leg lock me. He didn't have any deodorant on at all. It was like being strangled

198
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:48,600
by a boiled onion. I love sniffing Mando in the morning. Others do too, which is why our listeners

206
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,200
to the show. Is the idea that gravity would be way stronger on those planets that are larger?

207
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,320
Yeah, it's all about mass. Many of them are super earths. They're many thousands of times larger

208
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:52,840
than earth. Some are close, but even a little bit of mass increase, even going to one point. And I

209
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:59,080
did in doing this study, I went up to 1.5 the mass of earth just to have a little cushion there,

210
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,520
saying, well, what if we went up 0.15 the size of earth more, which is a little generous, I think,

211
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,400
because bipedalism is almost non-existent here. But I did allow for that and it was still in

212
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:22,440
between 2 and 4%. So you think that, I mean, obviously you've studied the evolution of our

213
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:29,480
species extensively. And you seem to think, you believe that if you go way back millions of years

214
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,080
ago to our early ancestors and where we are now, you can project out what we're going to look like

215
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,000
in a million years and a couple hundred thousand years. And you think that that would be

216
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,840
what these aliens look like with huge eyes, big heads, no muscles, skinny, small bodies.

217
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,840
And what makes you think that we would look like that? And what would be the

218
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,280
environmental conditions that would make us evolve that way?

219
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,720
Right. Well, yeah, there's a couple of things to unpack there. I don't want to get too technical,

220
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,200
or maybe I can and people can just fast forward to this part. But it's good to have it out there,

221
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:13,160
I guess, if people want the information. But so in looking at the specifics of our evolution,

222
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,640
Kim, a lot of people would write to me and be like, yeah, this makes sense. You know,

223
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,080
we'll blow up this planet, we'll have to live in space or go underground. So that's why our

224
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,520
eyes would get bigger because we have to see in the dark or whatever. Maybe, I don't know.

225
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:35,080
But that's speculation. And I tried to avoid speculating in these books and instead focus on

226
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:41,960
long term trends that are understandable in the context of the length of those trends and what

227
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,480
happens. And we might be able to extrapolate those a little bit. And I do that. But extrapolation

228
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,960
isn't necessarily the same thing as speculation, because we have data that can back up that trend

229
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,280
and then see how that would move forward in the future. So a couple of important ones are

230
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:04,760
obviously brain size. Going back to the time of Australopithecus africanus right between when we

231
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,600
stood up right and where we are now, their brains are bigger, right? Much, much smaller.

232
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,240
Oh, really? They were bigger. 3.5 million years ago, they were third the size of ours,

233
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,760
they're about 420 cubic centimeters. On average, the modern human brains between 1400 and 1600

234
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,640
cubic centimeters. So about the third the size of our own about the same size as chimpanzee,

235
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,480
little bit bigger than a child. It wasn't until we get beyond the Australopithecines homo habilis,

236
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,960
you see a little jump. And then with homo erectus throughout the time of homo erectus,

237
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,400
we start to see an accelerating curve, where it gets bigger and bigger by the time you get

238
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,200
to Heidelbergensis, Rudolfensis, Bodensis, all of those. It's getting to the point where

239
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,200
they look more modern. Their postcranial skeleton is almost the same as ours. It's a little more

240
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,760
robust based on where they live and what they did. But their cranial facial anatomy is still

241
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,920
pretty primitive. They have a prognathic face, a low sloping forehead, big brow ridges, simply

242
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,960
because their forehead hasn't, their brain hasn't grown out over top the eyes yet. And in addition

243
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,320
to us being the only biped, we're also the only mammal with a brain that sits right on top of the

244
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:18,440
eyes. And it's interesting. Yeah, it's something that I took this study of craniofacial evolution

245
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,800
and applied it in a biomedical context to see if that the two main changes throughout hominid

246
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,600
evolution are an increase in brain size, it moves forward and expands medial laterally.

247
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,520
And one of the characteristics that defines anatomically modern homo sapiens is we have

248
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,880
neurocranial globularity, our brains expanded to the extent that we have like bobbleheads basically,

249
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,960
and our faces are shrunk back. So we have this trade off between the brain and the face. Brain

250
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:48,680
grows out, expands, face gets smaller, teeth get smaller, and we have a chin. As that happens,

251
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:56,280
we have what's called a mental eminence, where our teeth and our masticatory muscles retract

252
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,360
and recess so much that we have a little chin that sticks out. Right. And this has a lot to do,

253
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,640
I'm from what I understand, this has a lot to do with the way we ate in our diets back then,

254
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,880
like chewing meat all the time. Yeah, and tool use too. We started to be able to cut our meat,

255
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,920
we could cook our meat, which was a big one. Going back 1.8 million years ago, we started using fire.

256
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:21,400
And we can also process our food, we can cut into smaller strips, we can cook it, we can pound up

257
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,160
fibrous plant materials. There was an offshoot here, if you pull out on that.

258
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,080
Where are they? I guess they didn't include them on there. Oh, they're there. Boisei,

259
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:41,240
Garhi, and Robustus, those ones in the middle there. Those are all called robust australopithecines,

260
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,560
because they- Can you punch in on that, Steve?

261
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,760
They did the opposite. What they have, and you can even see on the australopithecus boisei,

262
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,400
this little ridge running from around the top, that's called a sagittal crest. You see that in

263
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,760
gorillas too. And gorillas are vegetarians. They mostly feed on nettle, and they have these big

264
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,200
bellies because they have to break down that fibrous plant material. They have to spend a

265
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,080
lot of time chewing it. And these guys went that route. They went the vegetarian route, like gorillas.

266
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,400
We went the omnivore route, started eating meat, and that helped our brains get bigger,

267
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,880
and likely we killed them off, maybe even ate them. The meat made our brains get bigger?

268
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,080
It's called the expensive tissue hypothesis, where because of the way we can break down

269
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,160
the proteins in meat and turn it into the sugars that we need for our brain, we see not just a

270
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,880
decrease in our gastrointestinal system around this time, but also that's when our brains started to

271
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,000
get bigger. So Lesley Aiello in South Africa proposed that, I think back in the 90s, called

272
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,520
it the expensive tissue hypothesis. But you can see it here. They were a dead end. They have no

273
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,280
living descendants. Who? Which ones? The robusta australopithecine. Boisei, robustus,

274
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,200
and garhi, up just to the top right of that. I'm getting off track a little bit. I told

275
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,080
you there's a lot of moving parts. I love this stuff. So what was the explanation for that

276
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,480
thing across the top of their head, that gray part? Chewing. Yeah. So they have these big massive

277
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,200
faces, and you can see it just looking between robustus there and africanus to the right.

278
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Robustus was a dead end. They went veggie. Their faces got huge, but their brain couldn't get any

279
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,320
bigger because it was all face. We went the opposite direction. Africanus, afarensis,

280
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,840
all of the Homo that came after that. We were able to shrink our faces back, especially with

281
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,720
Homo erectus. That's why we see this accelerating trend, what we call biocultural evolution,

282
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,000
because we started using tools. We started using fire that allowed our face to get out of the way

283
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,560
of our brain, because the brain grows first and it leaves less time and space for the face to grow

284
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:47,000
out. It's just an aspect of the modularity, the way the different parts of our craniofacial anatomy

285
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,880
grow. But when we needed a face, when we were constantly chewing on fibrous plant material,

286
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,520
the face had to be there. There was selection for that. Once we relaxed that selective pressure,

287
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,080
teeth get smaller, masticatory muscles get smaller. Our temporalis muscles are the ones

288
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,360
that would come up and attach to that sagittal crest and the robustus or lopithecines. Right.

289
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,080
Now they attach right here. They're all the way down here. We have very thin skulls. Our brain

290
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,360
can grow out over our eyes. Like I started to say earlier, one of the things I look at in a

291
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:23,080
biomedical sense is how that impacts vision. If juvenile onset myopia, stigmatism, which what you

292
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:31,960
see with a highly myopic eye is it's elongated. Myopic meaning short-term distance. Yeah, we call

293
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,160
it farsighted, but you can't see things at a distance. Nearsighted, it's sort of weird how

294
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,280
they phrased it. We say nearsighted, but you can't see things at a distance. I'm very nearsighted,

295
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,040
like negative five diopters. But what happens is the eye is expanded or medial or not medial

296
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,960
laterally, but from front to back. And what it does is it changes the focal length where the image

297
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:00,200
focuses in front of the retina instead of on the retina. And what I proposed in a paper, I think in

298
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,280
2012, is that that may just be a function of our massive brains growing out over top of the eyes

299
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,920
and our face is shrinking back underneath them and the eye becomes sandwiched in between. And

300
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,320
the only place for it to go is out. It can't go up because the brain's there. It can't go down

301
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,800
because the face is there. So it's being squeezed almost like a tennis ball. If you squeeze it from

302
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,080
top to bottom, it has the same shape as a myopic eye. So I proposed that in 2012 and it's gotten

303
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:31,880
some traction. In any case, sorry, I went down a little rabbit hole there. So where does that go,

304
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,200
though, if you extrapolate out into the future? Right. And that's why it's extrapolation and not

305
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,280
speculation, because this is a six to potentially eight million year old trend. This has been

306
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,840
happening regardless of where we lived on this planet, what our political system, group size,

307
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,800
economic system was like. This has just happened. Right. So if you project that into the future,

308
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:57,640
and it is an acceleration, and this doesn't even take into account how they might be manipulating

309
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,840
us in some way, we could get into the hybrid program if you want to. This is just strictly

310
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:09,800
what's been happening over the course of the entirety of hominid evolution. To add another

311
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:15,000
little side angle here, I also, and there's some images in that second book where I show,

312
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:23,000
based on some geometric morphometric analyses I did, how the shape of our skulls is likely to

313
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,440
change with another dominant trend called craniofacial feminization, which is where

314
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:35,080
we're basically, our skull shape is turning more female. And what happens there, this is largely

315
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,640
as a result of self-domestication. We've been domesticating ourselves for about the last 30,000

316
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,760
years. Can you explain that? What does that mean, domesticating ourselves? Well, in the same way

317
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,880
that we see morphological changes in cows and sheep, and foxes was one of the first studies

318
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:56,120
See, it's called craniofacial feminization. Craniofacial. So in the same way that

319
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:03,080
when we domesticate foxes, very quickly they go from having pointy ears to saggy ears,

320
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,160
and from a tail that comes up to a tail that comes down as a little curve, they start barking. They

321
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:12,120
do all these things that we see in domesticated dogs. Similar things happen to us. There's this

322
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,400
suite of characteristics that change in us simply because we've been domesticating ourselves

323
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,480
With agriculture, about 12,000 years ago, that ramped up tremendously. We started to

324
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,680
be more domesticated, and a lot of the reason for it is because we're selecting for what are called

325
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:34,200
pro-social behaviors. When we were hunter-gatherers, if somebody pissed us off, we would just leave and

326
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,760
go somewhere else. We'd take our clan and we'd move to a different area. As space fills up,

327
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,480
it gets harder to do that. One of the main reasons space fills up is because of agriculture.

328
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,800
People just don't have the ability to move, and why would you? If you spent all of this time

329
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,880
tending to the soil and weeding and removing bugs from your fields, you're going to stay there.

330
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,280
You're going to reap what you sow. So we stay in the same place. We're forced to get along with

331
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:04,280
people, and what that does is it creates for more pro-social behaviors. We get along, and that

332
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:09,400
exacerbates these trends toward craniofacial feminization. So what I did, and again,

333
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,880
sorry if this is getting too technical, but I did a geometric morphometric analysis,

334
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:20,520
which factors out size. So we can just look at the shape of a male and female skull,

335
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,960
and so I projected what the extreme female shape would be. So if this trend continued,

336
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,760
if this craniofacial feminization trend continued, what would the male,

337
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,080
what would all of our skulls look like? And what was really interesting about it is it looked just

338
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:43,240
like one of these gray aliens. You had a forehead that was higher, you had a more forward brain,

339
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,520
and you had even more medial lateral expansion of the parietal lobes in the back. And if you look at

340
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,800
these classic images or even like Skinny Bob or any of these videos where they depict these things,

341
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,760
they have that big round area back here, and the parietal lobes are actually what has been expanding

342
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:06,920
the most throughout the last 200, 300,000 years. So it doesn't say this is what is going to

343
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,760
happen, but it shows if this trend continues. So wait, if my parietal lobe is expanding,

344
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,560
does that explain why I get so excited for public rec? Smart humans can't resist the allure of

345
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,960
public rec fabrics. It's comfort wear disguises casual clothing, like if aliens were disguised

346
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,720
as humans from the future. If I were a time traveler, I'd wear this. My favorite are the

347
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,120
daymaker pants. It's the comfort of sweatpants, except nobody knows it. Imagine going to work

348
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,200
and looking at all your coworkers and smiling every day. I can't do that without my public rec

349
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,280
pants. And they're perfect for golfing, flexible enough to give me a few more yards off the tee

350
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,120
box. When Danny's out golfing, I have to jump into the bushes and collect his balls.

351
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,600
Now I know why he laughs while I struggle and sweat in my primitive jeans. It's because his

352
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,560
daymaker pants are so comfy that he doesn't have to go without pants anymore. Public rec has finally

353
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,840
allowed me to enjoy pants in my life. It's soft and stretchy, and I use them for jogging, traveling,

354
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,640
and podcasting. The stretch on these pants are elite. When Danny wrestles people on the street

355
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,640
who don't like the show, he does so knowing that all that twisting and squeezing won't crush his

356
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,440
family jewels. It's almost like they came from the future to speed up our evolution by changing our

357
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,680
flexibility. Maybe it's so we can run away from the invaders faster. Or maybe they realize that

358
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,240
pants should just fit you, no matter if you gain or lose a little around the waist. The best pants

364
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:01,160
We would have more of these characteristics consistent with that of these gray aliens.

365
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,680
Another interesting thing too, and I show this in a video at lectures sometimes,

366
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:10,440
because I did a video of how we go from extreme male to extreme female, is that the orbits go up

367
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,880
and around. And that's what people so often describe in these cases of close contact,

368
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,680
that the eyes are bigger. And that would likely be another rabbit hole, this very technical,

369
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:26,040
that I'll give you maybe a brief example of. But the eyes are described as being larger

370
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:31,720
and wraparound, that they come up and around. And you can see that in this animation from this

371
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,600
geometric morphometric analysis going from extreme male to extreme female. Is this something we can

372
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:43,320
find online? No, I could send it to you if you want to edit it in later. Let's pull out the picture

373
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,400
of Whitley's alien on the communion. That's a great example of the wraparound eyes, I think.

374
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,520
Yeah, and it's classic. Every single person describes it. And they're these haunting eyes,

375
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,400
like you see the windows are the eyes to the soul. And it's like they're mesmerized by the soul

376
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,720
of these highly intelligent, highly conscious, empathetic creatures. And it just sucks people

377
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,920
in. Some people can't even look at them because it's too intense. Have you ever gotten your eyes

378
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,320
dilated, the eye doctor? Yeah. Sometimes I don't even need them to, I just want them to do it.

379
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,200
I'll go home and just like stare at my children and they can't look at me because it just freaks

380
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,560
them out too much, you know? Really? Yeah. And they don't know. So I'll have sunglasses on.

381
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,560
Start screaming. Because yeah, it's freaky. You know, even someone on acid. Or Adderall.

382
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,400
I've seen people come in, like I've talked to people like I'm jacked on Adderall. And those

383
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,480
are just normal sized eyes. Those are modern human eyes. We're talking about, you know,

384
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,440
these gray aliens with these massive pupils already, even bigger. People really struggle

385
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:46,120
to look in those. It's crazy. So, okay, you explained earlier though, like how the brain

386
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,520
would grow, like forward and take up all this space and like crush the eyes. But then how do

387
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:58,280
you explain the eyes getting huge and wrapping around like that? Yeah, no, it's a great question.

388
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:05,960
The main thing, and I pointed this out in that 2012 medical hypothesis paper too,

389
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:15,160
one of the main reasons why the eye would grow larger is because our brains have grown larger

390
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,080
throughout hominid evolution. And the eye is part of the brain. The eye is part of the brain. Yeah.

391
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:24,840
So it grows out of the telencephalon of the brain, the forebrain, basically, during early fetal

392
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:30,680
ontogeny. So it is part of the brain. It grows out from the brain. And more importantly, they appear

393
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:37,800
to be linked because of something called pleiotropy, where you can have the same gene or set of genes

394
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:44,920
controlling seemingly different anatomical parts. So we see the eye and brain as being different,

395
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,400
but because it grows out of the brain and it's governed by the same genes,

396
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,240
it is essentially the same thing. So as the brain gets larger, we would also expect the eye to get

397
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:02,360
larger. And then, yeah, couple that with the, and again, this isn't necessarily going to happen.

398
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:07,720
It's just a model based on this dominant trend of craniofacial feminization over the last 30,000

399
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:14,600
years. But couple that with the fact that we do see this expansion and posterior rotation of the

400
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:21,560
upper part of the eye orbits, I find to be really interesting. Yeah, it makes so much sense. What,

401
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:29,160
um, there's another, there's a, there's a bunch of other compelling reasons for these creatures

402
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:35,720
to be time travelers. But to me, another interesting thing was how there's the SETI researchers who say

403
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,680
there's no evidence of like traffic or super highways of any kind of ships or any kind of

404
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,400
crafts coming in and out of our atmosphere. There's nothing going on in space. It's super quiet,

405
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,680
but there's all these electromagnetic anomalies that are happening around the world. And especially

406
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,040
in the places where a lot of these experiences or a lot of these sightings of UFOs have happened.

407
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,680
What, how do you explain the electromagnetic anomalies?

408
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:07,720
Yeah. Um, before we get into that, I, I forgot one key bit of evidence related to the morphological

409
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,960
thing. So for the people fast forwarding through this, just, but you know, hit for,

410
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,600
I promise you, you might miss an ad, you might miss an ad, so stay with us.

411
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,720
But, but I did just want to bookend this with one other thing that I think is pretty compelling,

412
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,240
which is also technical. So I want to just squish them together before we move on.

413
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,920
And that's called pedomorphosis, which is an aspect of neoteny. It's a very common thing

414
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:39,720
in evolutionary biology where as an adult, you have characteristics more indicative of

415
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,360
the juveniles of your ancestors. So let me say that another way that

416
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:51,640
when you have the descendants of say group A, when they're, when they've reached full maturity,

417
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,760
when they've finished ontogeny, as we call it, life history cycle, they look more like the kids

418
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:04,680
of their ancestors. So that is interesting to me because it's yet another, I would argue,

419
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,240
line of evidence to suggest that they are us, because that's a trend that also characterizes

420
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,440
hominin evolution, that we look more like the kids of our ancestors.

421
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:21,080
And that is also described in a number of cases of close encounters. You have Terry Lovelace

422
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:25,560
turn into his friend Toby saying, what are those kids doing out there in the field under this craft?

423
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:31,560
I mentioned Travis Walton often too, where he described them as overgrown fetuses. That's

424
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,840
exactly what we'd expect to see because of this other evolutionary trend. So there's just so many

425
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:42,520
little things characteristic of our morphological evolution, pedomorphosis being another one of

426
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,720
those. You can see it really well with dogs. I make the comparison in my first book with dogs.

427
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,000
Is there an example in nature we can think of of pedomorphosis?

428
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,120
Yeah, if you pulled up, that's actually in my book, the one with the two chimps there.

429
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,840
On the bottom right?

430
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:02,040
Bottom right. Yeah. So if you look at the baby chimp, it has a larger, more projecting forehead,

431
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,040
a smaller, more recessed and retracted mid and lower facial anatomy. But as an adult,

432
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,360
once it reaches full maturity, its face is all the way shrunk down. It's got a low sloping forehead

433
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,480
and the brow ridge. So that's just another example over a long period since we split with them,

434
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,440
since the bifurcation of the chimp line and the modern human line.

435
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,440
We look much more like baby chimps.

436
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,040
Yeah. They look like, I think I said in my book, they look like somebody's Harry grandma or

437
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:35,400
something. But that's another important one, too. And honestly, in Steven Spielberg's

438
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:43,000
Close Encounters of the Third Kind, he sort of threw a little bone to people when these

439
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,760
childlike beings come out of the craft and it lands on the top of Devil's Tower.

440
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,600
There's the World War II pilots who hadn't aged at all.

441
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,320
They don't age, right?

442
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,160
They don't age. That's a little shout out to time travel right there.

443
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,480
But they're very kidlike. They're small. They're very, you know, petite, childlike.

444
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,600
And we do this, Spielberg and his genius did this intentionally. That's what he did with E.T.

445
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,680
to make an alien that was cute and cuddly that Drew Barrymore would want to give Reese's pieces

446
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,880
to and, you know, hide in her closet with their other stuffed animals that we also make to be

447
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,840
more pedomorphic and lovable. It's something called Kind and Schema. This guy, Lorentz,

448
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:21,640
I think he was Austrian, first wrote about, and I believe the 40s and 50s,

449
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,120
it's what Walt Disney used to launch his franchise. Mickey Mouse used to just be a little

450
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,320
mouse. After this study, he realized if I make Mickey Mouse look cute and pedomorphic,

451
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,800
people are going to like him more. They did this with all their Disney characters.

452
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,560
And it's a big part of why Disney was so successful. Gave them the big ears,

453
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,000
oversized hands and feet, big eyes. It's why you'll see cheetahs raising gazelles

454
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,360
because they see this little baby. They chase off the mom. They don't want to eat it because

455
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,560
it's cute and they end up raising it as their own. And it's this drive that we have to take

456
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:57,080
care of cute things. It's just innate within us and all mammals, apparently. We all do it

457
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,080
because it's cute. You just want to take care of it. I had a little baby fawn come into my yard

458
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,760
about a month and a half ago. It was all cut up. Coyote got it. And, you know, I'm patching it up,

459
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,800
wiping off its wounds and stuff. And it's just, they're adorable. You can't not take care of them,

460
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,160
you know? It's just this intuitive, sort of ingrained aspect of our physiology,

461
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,000
but it's all related to that pedomorphosis. We want to have cute babies. So when they're crying

462
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,600
and they're pissing us off, we don't just throw them out the window. Right. Exactly. Yes. Yeah.

463
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:35,320
That makes a lot of sense. Okay. So let me see if I got this right. My takeaway from this whole

464
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:42,440
thing, and I think the way you summed it up towards the end of the book, is that we have tons of

465
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:50,440
evidence of UFOs around schools showing themselves to children and then around like military bases,

466
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,920
activating and deactivating nukes. These children have, they get these telepathic

467
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,040
communications about saving the planet, about nuclear destruction. You had the one lady who

468
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,800
was brought to like a hilltop where they showed a bunch of like rockets and stuff like that. And

469
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,080
they said, we're not going to make you forget this or make sure you don't forget this.

470
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:14,200
It seems like whatever this phenomena that's happening that people are experiencing is,

471
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:21,000
there's a very unique correlation between all of them where it's like,

472
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,800
save, keep the planet safe from destruction and don't kill, don't annihilate the planet,

473
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:34,920
right? And save, don't kill other species even in some, like some of them talk about like even like,

474
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,960
I forget who it is. I think Chris Bledsoe was in here saying that they had an experience where

475
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:43,560
they were like, don't kill other animals or anything like that. But it's like preservation

476
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,040
of the planet and the species, it seems like. And if this was an extraterrestrial race coming

477
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:53,640
to our planet, it wouldn't make a lot of sense that they would care. Why would they care that

478
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:58,680
we preserve ourselves? But if it was a future human race, you would see how they would be very

479
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:08,440
invested in preaching that message to us to protect the planet. And I've talked about this

480
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,360
at Nausium, but I had a lady on here recently, Annie Jacobson wrote a book called Nuclear War,

481
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:17,640
and she talks about after the nuclear war, after the nuclear winter, you know, 90, you know,

482
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,440
89% of the human race will be wiped out and the people who do live will have to live underground

483
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,200
because there will be, it'll be blacked out. It'll be just plague infesting the earth. And then when

484
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:35,160
the atmosphere or when the clouds, the nuclear ash finally clears, there will be no atmosphere

485
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:41,400
and exposure to the ultraviolet radiation from the sun for even like five minutes will just kill you.

486
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:48,600
That combined with like the rotting corpses that have been outside for a decade for seven,

487
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:55,000
I think she said like seven to 14 years before it clears up. Those frozen corpses will now be like

488
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,560
getting baked by the sun causing even more plague and disease and like nasty, nasty shit. So no one

489
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:08,040
would want to be outside. You'd want to be living underground and you would, people would be forced

490
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:15,000
to breed with each other and it would be incest. So we would lose the genetic diversity that we

491
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,760
have now on earth. And if that happened far in the future, it would make sense that we would

492
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:29,560
want to travel back in time and diversify our species by breeding with them. That's basically,

493
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:37,240
I mean, that seems like it makes a lot of sense. Yeah, yet another compelling little morsel to chew

494
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:43,640
on. Maybe actually not a delicious morsel. That sounds horrible. All of that sounds nightmarish,

495
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:50,120
but yeah. And you couple that with how commonly, yeah, like you said, experiencers

496
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,840
speak of something coming, you know, some sort of cataclysm, something transformational earth

497
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:02,680
shattering, whether that be a shift in consciousness, a sort of mass awakening or something that

498
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,960
really has to spur that into existence or the dark night of the soul in a novel where you hit

499
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,160
rock bottom and everything's bad, but then you emerge from it with this new insight and this new

500
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:19,160
way of perceiving not just what's happening now, but who you were before. Maybe we look back on

501
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,360
humanity and say, well, yeah, that was dumb. What were we doing? You know, in so many capacities,

502
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,720
war, just overuse of fossil fuels, over consumption. There's so many things, but yeah,

503
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:35,160
in a biological sense, what would that do to our genome? What would that do to our genetic diversity?

504
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:43,560
And in my first book, I mentioned the case of Jim Penniston, who completely independently,

505
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:49,880
and in fact, I only learned of his account or his interaction at Randall Shum, maybe a month or two

506
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:56,360
before my first book came out, but he specifically remembers being told that they were having

507
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,120
problems with reproduction in the future and they're coming back to get genetic material

508
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,440
to help diversify their gene pool. I had already written a whole section about that in my first

509
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:10,200
book, just based on past trends and how previously we used to have gene flow between isolated

510
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,960
populations, interbreeding groups, and you do have incest on islands and all kinds of weird stuff

511
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,600
happens. But if you interject new genes into that population, you can get around that problem. So

512
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:25,000
what we do with panda bears and gorillas at zoos, we're constantly switching them around and switching

513
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,760
up, adding new genetic variation to help diversify those gene pools. So I argued that maybe that's

514
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:37,880
what they're doing too, even outside of any sort of cataclysm or bottleneck, as we call it in

515
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:45,320
genetics. But in addition to that, in my second book, I also listed a number of other things

516
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:51,880
that could help account for why it's so ubiquitous that they do come back and get genetic material,

517
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:57,960
sperm from males, eggs from females. Many cases, that woman, Terry, that John Mack

518
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,360
interviewed as one of his patients, who was the one talking about being shown the missiles and

519
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:11,240
war scenarios. She was also subjected to a number of pregnancies, fetuses being implanted, extracted,

520
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:15,960
implanted, extracted. Linda Jones was another one also in that book. So what are they doing? Why are

521
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:22,520
they doing this? It's one of the most common features of these abductions. So even outside

522
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:29,560
of this potential homogenization of our gene pool or interbreeding incest that happens after

523
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:35,000
a bottleneck. What does homogenization mean again? Just all the same. And that's where the incest

524
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,240
comes from, because all your genes start to have what we call alleles identical by descent. They're

525
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:47,560
not similar, they're the same, because you got the same ancestors. So even outside of that, we see

526
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:54,360
problems with the reduction in sperm count, for instance, in males. 50% in, I think it's actually

527
00:46:54,360 --> 00:47:00,520
60% in the Western world, 50% globally, reduction in sperm counts. Women are having a harder time

528
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:06,440
giving birth. In vitro fertilization, which is great for helping individuals, also helps their

529
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:12,360
genes, which weren't ideal for reproduction on their own, to get into future populations.

530
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:18,520
So you're taking genes that would otherwise be selected against and allowing them to propagate

531
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,240
through the future. There's also the risk that we run if we start to manipulate our own DNA. And I

532
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:29,000
listed a number of cases in my second book where we've already run into problems. Because if you

533
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:36,200
start modifying even somatic cells, you're trying to help with some congenital disease, so someone's

534
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:43,800
not affected. But if those modifications get into our heritable genome, to our gametes, not

535
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,840
just our somatic cells, you can cut off your arm, go make a baby, your baby's going to come out with

536
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:54,040
two arms. Because that's your somatic cells. But if you stand in front of a microwave or dip your

537
00:47:54,040 --> 00:48:02,200
testicles in toxic sludge every day for years, that's going to affect your babies. So seemingly,

538
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:09,320
if we do things to try to help alleviate problems, genetic conditions, and that modifies

539
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:14,440
our heritable traits, who knows what's going to happen? So that could contribute to different

540
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:19,160
problems. Designer babies would be a big one, because we are actually changing the way those

541
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:24,120
genes are expressed. Are we doing, people are having designer babies? Not yet. No, I believe

542
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:31,160
it's still illegal. But it seems like it'll start with trying to cure disease. Even that could cause

543
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:38,440
these same problems. It's a good idea. It may have negative latent outcomes that we can't account

544
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:44,120
for. I'm just saying there's a lot of things that we can do now that go outside of just the fact that

545
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:49,880
we live in one island of Earth, an incestuous island of Earth, that we are homogenizing our genome

546
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,800
because of our culture, which we've always used to help our biology. It could actually hurt.

547
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,120
Anyway, there's just a lot of reasons why they might want to come back and get our genes.

548
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:07,000
So yeah, what's going on with that? If we start looking at the hybridization program,

549
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,080
if we take that seriously, that adds a number of other questions. You have people like Whitley

550
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:18,360
Strieber, Terry Lovelace, who described seeing these different forms all working together on the

551
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:24,760
same ship, some of whom are in modern military uniforms. Are we already working with them? Are

552
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,920
we aware of what they're doing? Was there some sort of contract that was made that Grush pointed

553
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,520
out and a number of others have as well? How many abduction cases have you read through

554
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,920
personally? I don't know. Thousands?

555
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,520
Well, we know John Mack did what? How many? It was probably about 20.

556
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:53,000
Well, he wrote about probably 15 or 20 in abduction, but he references others.

557
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,760
I think he interviewed over a thousand, right? I can't tell you the exact number, but it was a lot.

558
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,320
What percentage of them say they're future humans and what percentage of them tell the people that

559
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:10,280
they're aliens from another galaxy? That's a great question. Honestly, I would feel a little

560
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:16,680
disingenuous giving an answer because I haven't really sat down and crunched those numbers. But

561
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,840
this is split. There is a split. Yeah. Oh yeah. A lot of them are told they're future humans.

562
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:25,720
Absolutely. And why do you think that some of them would say they're from like Zeta Reticuli or some

563
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:31,720
other star system? Well, this would actually be a great study for a graduate student, especially with

564
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,760
all of the supercomputing capabilities we have. And if we can enter all of these cases into a

565
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:41,320
database that's searchable, you could easily answer that question. And it would also be

566
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:46,760
interesting, and this would be a hypothesis that you could test, is there a temporal relationship

567
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:52,920
there? Are there more that are told they're from outer space farther into the past because we

568
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,600
didn't think about time, you know? And it's probably easier for them with some farmer from

569
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,200
South Dakota to say, oh, we're from that star. Which star? Oh, that one up there. Don't worry

570
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,440
about it. Well, Barney Hill, Betty and Barney Bill was in the seventies, early seventies.

571
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:14,040
And we have, there's accounts of them telling abductees that they're future humans. Oh,

572
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:18,440
in the sixties, early sixties. Okay. I'm not exactly sure, but I know it was the sixties. I

573
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:24,040
think it was early sixties. Yeah. A database of all these things with like all, like a breakdown

574
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:30,760
of all the communication and all the experience would be great. I had this dude, Sam, I'll text

575
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:38,520
this to you, Steve. Oh, well, that's weird. He just texted me. Pull this up. TheUFOTimeline.com.

576
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:48,120
So Sam put together this incredible database with like amazing graphics and visuals

577
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:55,800
of every UFO sighting. And I think it's like any UFO encounter in history,

578
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:02,040
but it like includes abductions. I don't know how DP goes into the details of the abductions.

579
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:07,320
Interactive map. Yeah, there you go. No, no, go to the timeline. Timeline. There you go.

580
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,840
So this hypothesis I'm proposing. Interactive map on the right.

581
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:17,000
Interactive map. One more. That's his timeline. Oh shit.

582
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:29,640
No, that's not it. Click on early access. Oh, son of a bitch. He sent it to me. Whatever. Go to the

583
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:36,840
Twitter link I sent you. It'll show you a little demonstration of it and what it looks like.

584
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:43,560
Wow, that is so awesome. Yeah, that's it. So yeah, so you can like scroll through,

585
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,320
that's the timeline on the top. It shows you like the year that everything happens.

586
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,680
Shows you like, look at, he has like breakdown of craft type, shape, entity type.

587
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:58,360
Yeah, this is exactly what we need. This is, this is insane. He's been working on this for years.

588
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:03,160
If you could have the details of each of these cases, the hypothesis I'm proposing is that in

589
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:07,880
more recent time, we have more of them saying we're from your future. Whereas farther back,

590
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:14,120
they say, or like Betty Hill, where she was supposedly shown the star map. This woman,

591
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,680
I think Fisher was her last name, tried to even reconstruct it. Carl Sagan and other astrophysicists

592
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:24,360
look at it, eventually rejected it because it didn't fit. And it's data mining. Of course,

593
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,960
if you throw, you know, five or six stars up there, you're going to find something that matches it.

594
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,200
It's like monkeys on typewriters are eventually going to type out Shakespeare's works.

595
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,840
Yeah. So she tried to, she claimed that they showed her some sort of 3d star map that had like

596
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,520
12 stars in it. And they like tried to put her in a trance and put her in a flow state to figure out

597
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:45,400
what it looked like. And exactly. And what's interesting is this guy, Michael Swords, who

598
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:50,040
wrote this critique against this time travel theory back in the eighties and nineties actually

599
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:55,640
made more of a case for it than he did against it. And I talk about him a lot in my second book as

600
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:01,400
well, but he was like, you can't argue that the time travel theory is real without also accounting

601
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,000
for Betty Hill and her star map. Cause that proves that they're from outer space. I'm like,

602
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,600
bro, that's one data point, you know, much respect for this guy, tons of respect,

603
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:13,080
but that's one data point. You also can't base all of your arguments against a theory

604
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:18,120
on one singular data point that eventually was gone on to be shown. It wasn't true.

605
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:25,080
And even more interestingly, the video I just sent you to send Steve shows Betty Hill holding

606
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:30,520
this 3d model of the beam that she interacted with that she took to biological anthropologists

607
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:34,840
who told her, oh, that's what we're going to look like in your future. Betty Hill's team time travel.

608
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,560
A lot of people don't realize that they get off at the star map and they're like, oh,

609
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:43,480
she must think that they're extraterrestrial. They told her they were, she's team time travel now.

610
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,080
Really? Yeah. I mean, I think she's dead, but toward the end of her life,

611
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:53,240
she was squarely on the side because she saw in this form that that's exactly what we're going

612
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,920
to look like. And she was told that by experts in the field. Steve, you get that video I just sent

613
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:04,040
you? The YouTube video? It just popped up. I think that higher evolution can only come from

614
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,440
factor meals. You don't have to count calories or avoid foods that make you groggy. You just

633
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:52,520
show. Small orifice for a mouth and actually instead of whites actually have yellow eyes and

634
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:59,800
the iris is a pupil. We put yellow in to emphasize him. I was going to say he needs

635
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:08,600
byzine or he looks like he has malaria. Okay now, Junior has been evaluated by, I don't know how

636
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:15,880
many physical anthropologists, but what he looks like now, if we continue along the path of evolution,

637
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:25,960
this is what we're going to look like in 25,000 years. And would we be mammalian, reptilian or

638
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:30,360
insectoid or a combination of the three? I mean because if you look at the way we're on our way

639
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:38,040
with the nuclear, there was a nuclear exposure in Japan for instance and radiation causes mutation

640
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:42,280
and if you look along the lines of evolution we lost our appendix for instance people say we'll

641
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:48,440
lose our little toe because we don't need it. The brain capacity gets larger, you become more

642
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,360
spindly because we don't need muscles because it's mind over matter, correct? Is that the...

643
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:59,080
No. We're going to be like we are now except I mean look at mankind it's been around for

644
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:04,840
what 2.6 million years? Depends on who you talk to I guess, so subjective.

645
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:15,240
So that's basically what the astronaut looked like. Can I ask you something, when they put that needle

646
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,880
back on board the craft, they put the needle into your navel, some have speculated that perhaps they

647
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:24,520
were taking eggs or ovay or... No. No you don't think so? No. Because some have projected that,

648
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:28,840
isn't it interesting if you correlate that with test tube babies years on? Yeah well because you

649
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:36,600
know at the time this happened doctors said oh it's absolutely impossible to put a needle in

650
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:41,480
someone's navel, it would probably kill them but they get infections and then I think the process

651
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:48,200
was developed in a hospital down in Houston, Texas. Shortly afterwards. Yep. Did they do a

652
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:55,800
performance... Steve, see when this video was published? Hit escape, you'll see it. 99. Oh 99,

653
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:02,120
wow. This is what's dated here. Interesting. Isn't that cool though? That's super interesting.

654
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:08,520
Because yeah we got stuck on the... Lost 108 minute interview. Yeah we got stuck on the star map,

655
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:13,080
you know it dominated the conversation but... But she thinks they're future humans. Yeah.

656
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,680
And she doesn't think that they were trying to extract her eggs though.

657
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,360
No I think originally she thought that was a pregnancy test or something, it's been pointed

658
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:26,920
out to me by a gynecologist since that that's a dumb way to take a pregnancy test, that's probably

659
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:32,280
not what they were doing. So I don't know why they were doing what they were doing there

660
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:37,640
but it and so much of what they do is mysterious to us because we don't have the technology,

661
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:44,440
we don't have the knowledge of human anatomy that they have, diseases, parasites, there's just so

662
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:50,280
much so who knows. Have you noticed any biological correlation between all the people that have gone

663
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:55,880
through these experiments or been a part of these breeding programs? Like what do they have

664
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:04,280
anything in common? Me personally no but I mean there's the the cod 8 putamen study that Gary

665
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:10,040
Nolan did where they seemingly have more connections between the cod 8 and putamen in their brain.

666
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:16,600
Which can be an effect of trauma right? Yeah and and you know there there may be some relationship

667
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:23,880
with disassociation, with intuition, empathy, just sensing other people and if that's the case

668
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:30,440
you know then and this has been argued too that there's the case to be made that maybe it's an

669
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:35,560
antenna you know that we're ramping up those connections to be more connected to this thing

670
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:41,720
and and in my first book I look at this question what's with the telepathy basically? Is it a

671
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:47,560
brain-to-brain communication with some third-party medium with some technology or is it direct

672
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:52,920
brain-to-brain communication through consciousness? And I came out on the side of consciousness

673
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:58,520
that there seems to be the capacity to do this in people who have a first-time experience nothing's

674
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:04,760
been put in their brain it's just our minds connecting so to speak. So yeah I don't know and

675
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,720
maybe maybe there's some biophysical marker that would indicate that maybe it is the cod 8 putamen

676
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,720
or something else that we haven't yet identified but we're just scratching the surface we haven't

677
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,720
been allowed to talk about this stuff yet we haven't been able and we still can't get grants

678
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,880
to study this stuff and it's going to take money to get everybody an MRIs to do all these blood

679
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:26,360
tests genetic tests of markers and do you think it's true any of these stories that the government

680
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:32,760
has captured beings? I don't know. Like Roswell or anything like that. I'm on the fence about that because yeah you have

681
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:41,240
these videos and those can be faked. The alien autopsy like that one was faked but it was

682
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:47,720
allegedly based on real footage they just recreated it. You have people like Dan Burrish who claims to

683
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:56,360
have been a part of these he was I guess sampling this j-rod individual from some and who claimed

684
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:02,200
to have been future human from some 45 or 55 000 years in our future I forget which specifically.

685
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,920
So yeah you look at all of this even going back 10 years that would sound like nonsense. Right. Now

686
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,160
with Grush and his testimony and everything else you kind of have to start putting all of these

687
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:15,480
pieces together and looking at them holistically like maybe there's something to this. Are you familiar

688
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:20,840
with James James Fox's Varginia documentary? A lot of the aliens that were captured. I watched it with them in a

689
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:27,960
screening at the International UFO Congress in Phoenix 2022 maybe. So I think I think that case

690
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:33,080
happened that crash in Varginia Brazil was like 1992 I believe. I could be off by a couple years

691
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:39,160
92 or 96 maybe maybe maybe I'm getting that cut them conflated between that one and Ruiz. I think

692
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:45,480
it was the 90s. It was early 90s yeah and one of the beings was captured brought to a hospital

693
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:50,840
they said it reeked of of sulfur or ammonia or something it was sulfur they said they said the

694
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,480
hospital smelled like sulfur for weeks afterwards. He interviewed their x-ray technician and he said

695
01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:04,360
the things had cloven feet and red eyes. Weird. And then they apparently the US Air Force came in

696
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,680
and took the thing and left and there was like tons of military activity so they think somebody

697
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,280
if this story is real which it seems like there is because he interviewed so many witnesses around

698
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:17,160
the town and the doctors. And those the girls who saw it initially I think they found footprints in that

699
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:22,040
yard they were right where they encountered it. Yeah I know that's a fascinating case. Can you pull the picture

700
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:27,000
of the Varginia Brazil? There you go he got her. Fuck Steve's talking on it today.

701
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:33,560
Like that's a new one right there that's yeah I haven't seen that one but that's close that's

702
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:39,080
close to what he explained the red eyes the brown oily skin and the fingers were different

703
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:46,040
and the thing yeah I think it had three fingers maybe yeah find a different one like this one

704
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:51,400
seems a little off yeah it seems a little off from from the this doesn't seem to fit the abduction

705
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,440
encounters no but it's a data point so we got to take it into account we can't throw anything out

706
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,920
at this point right he said there was three horns on the head too like that one on the top left kind

707
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,840
of shows those three horns that one looks like three like bubbles or something one thing I often

708
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,880
wonder too is if the contacts that are so commonly seen on these are some sort of like

709
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:16,760
night vision or protective shield or maybe even technology of some sort that allows like the six

710
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:21,400
million dollar man he can like focus in or you know change the amount of light right and then

711
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:26,520
another thing you talk about in your book too so if we were if we were us yeah those are the

712
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:31,320
witnesses a million years from now or let's even say a hundred thousand years from now we got we

713
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:36,280
can travel backwards in time are we going to send ourselves backwards in time are we going to

714
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:42,040
send like some ai robots back in time I think both and there's evidence for both too I think

715
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:45,800
I think what an interesting case is the pascagoula

716
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:52,760
Calvin Parker Charles Hickson and that was also in the 70s I think I'm really bad at dates that's

717
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:59,320
why I'm not a historian but but they they were taken by a robot straight up no doubt about a

718
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:07,080
robot how do they describe it um elephant like skin hovering club feet antennas three antennas

719
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:13,960
not like that but like antennas and made beep boop bop type of sounds um picked them up carry

720
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:18,840
them into the ship where they saw fully modern looking humans and that's interesting for a couple

721
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:25,800
reasons one the humans you know looked like nerdy scientists and you're not going to go out there

722
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:31,720
and pick up two big dudes that are fishing who are scared shitless of what's happening to them

723
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:36,280
you're going to send a big burly robot you know the one that came into Whitley's room initially

724
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:42,120
had like a shield on it he describes being small but like he he mentioned them as being like the

725
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:46,600
transporters or kind of the muscle of the operation but the woman he interacted with a little like

726
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:53,000
ogre looking bees yeah yeah whose job may be just that like little abduction droids I think I called

727
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,600
them in my book but but then there was also the small grays and then the woman the tall gray

728
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:04,040
woman who seemingly have traits indicative of a more distant point in our future a more evolved

729
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:09,160
consciousness and the ability to control these other forms it's almost like they're using their

730
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:14,360
mind to control what's happening to orchestrate this thing and to keep people calm to the best of

731
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:18,200
their abilities in these moments so I absolutely think they're not just going to use robots like

732
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:24,440
in the past gagula case but that we would eventually bioengineer robots we get past moving

733
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:30,120
parts and things that can break down and need oiled but we will yeah we could 3d print a biological

734
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:35,800
being right yeah or even just hybridize using genetic manipulation the same way we went from

735
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:41,080
teosinte a corn of cob used to be about three inches tall to the big delicious ear of corn we

736
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:45,640
have now simply through the manipulation of genetics and selective hybridization selective

737
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:52,520
breeding so we might be able to do that to create kind of a robot like thing yeah you know the ones

738
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:57,000
without genitals maybe they don't need genitals because we're just making them maybe it helps

739
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,320
explain that aspect right because we can just create them they're not reproducing themselves

740
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:07,400
but they serve some specific function with regard to the abduction itself or they're carrying out

741
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:12,920
they're the the worker bees essentially of these these future humans right yeah those are those are

742
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:17,560
the things that he describes is that what they are is that what was in the movie where he said

743
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:21,960
the little beings that moved him around that these i think this is a joke yeah it is a joke

744
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:28,760
but it's probably like it it looks like the ones from the movie i think yeah so okay so so

745
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:38,760
yeah the the ones like the varginia alien is super strange because it it seems to

746
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:49,320
echo like biblical depictions of demons in ancient text in like biblical text they there's

747
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:56,040
recollections of demons smelling like sulfur and having cloven feet yeah and you know what's to

748
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,720
say if these things can they can travel back in time they could probably travel back to biblical

749
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:08,040
times oh absolutely and i wouldn't be surprised if much of our religious lore and in various

750
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:13,400
folkways and mores throughout history are the direct result of contact i mean why wouldn't they

751
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,640
be you know these seemingly magical beings come down from the sky they have the ability to

752
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:23,000
levitate they know the future like you think of the archangel gabriel who told mary that this

753
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,680
is going to happen you're going to have this one he knew the future he warned her about what's

754
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:32,120
going to happen it started with a dream and then you know clearly she was impregnated if you know

755
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:37,640
this situation i'm plain devil's advocate here um if that situation played out the way it was

756
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:44,520
described there's a lot of overlap with abduction encounters where there'll be dreams about this

757
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:49,160
it sort of normalizes it to some extent and then you're brought into this very strange world

758
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:56,200
jesus had paranormal powers he could heal the sick he could levitate he could make fish rain

759
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:01,320
down from the sky you could easily pull off all of those tricks with the technology that

760
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:07,320
is on display in these cases of close contact and it's a big a big uh yeah part of the storyline

761
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:11,480
in that book too which is let's talk about this for a minute your book revelation

762
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:20,680
with a beautiful beautiful artistry yeah depiction of jesus and dan i had that commissioned

763
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:27,240
and jesus christ is being sucked up into an spaceship a flying saucer throwing us the double

764
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:33,160
bird double bird yeah that is correct that's gorgeous and there's actually it's really really

765
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:40,360
funny how that happened because one of the artists i commissioned to do that piece i just did a sketch

766
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:45,240
of jesus doing this underneath the ufo like your classic little peace sign or whatever it was he

767
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:50,040
did he thought he was flipping the bird and then went even bigger and did the double bird

768
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:55,320
i was talking to him at this conference in new york city like man i totally respect that you

769
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:59,400
just took that and ran with it because they gave me that as the final proof yeah not even like hey

770
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:04,200
do you mind if we had jesus thrown up a middle finger let alone two of them and i was like i

771
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,640
can't believe you guys did they he's like didn't you draw that in the sketch i was like no but

772
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:12,840
there's actually a scene in the book where after jesus i don't want to give away too much but after

773
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:19,000
jesus is brought back to life there after the crucifixion that there's this scene where he's

774
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,440
shouting tupac lyrics you know going around jerusalem flipping everybody off you know like

775
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:30,440
it gets a little weird um so the fact that they just took that and ran with it

776
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:35,400
mistaking a sketch i had done and then there's actually a scene in the book where jesus is doing

777
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,800
that i was like well we got to keep that it'll probably piss people off but it's kind of funny

778
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:46,280
yeah that's funny yeah no if i had a time machine i would go back there's two points i'd go back to

779
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:50,600
i would want to see where the how the pyramids were built i want to see what jesus was doing

780
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:56,520
totally there was um actually in curt vonnegut slaughterhouse five that was one of the the

781
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:01,800
things they did too to go back and see if jesus actually died during the crucifixion or if it was

782
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:08,120
sort of uh just a dramatic thing to help spur i mean that's one of the main parts of the faith

783
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:15,800
you see the crosses jesus on it everywhere it's kind of the main main element of of that faith

784
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:20,360
is the crucifixion sacrificing yourself for humanity and whatnot yeah yeah i mean it's a

785
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,520
huge mystery right people want to believe it but the truth is about the gospels is that they were

786
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:31,800
written most of them hundreds of years later and they were written not by people who witnessed

787
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:36,760
stuff but they were basically the people who wrote them were writing them based on testimony

788
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:41,320
of people who told them that things happened and it was hundreds of years later so you know

789
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:47,400
and there's so many books that were taken out too that tell a very interesting story that maybe adds

790
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:53,080
a lot of depth and breadth to what happened because these things many of them were historical

791
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:57,240
events but they were just left out so most people have a very slimmed down version i saw you had jeff

792
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:02,520
crapple on your show not too long ago and he's written extensively about many of these other

793
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:07,640
texts gnostic texts and yeah and kind of what we can learn from those and many religious scholars

794
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:13,000
have as well but i really like his approach because he also focuses on many of the things

795
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,360
we're not supposed to talk about or that we'd like to pretend weren't characteristics of jesus

796
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:25,720
life and him lying with you know prostitutes and hanging out with the children the women of the

797
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:31,480
night children right yeah and a lot of that stuff was more common back then but we you don't want

798
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:36,440
christians don't want to think about jesus in that way so we paint this picture of what this was and

799
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:43,480
a big part of this book too is calling out the hypocrisy in that a lot of people have a mouthful

800
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:48,760
of scripture but a heart full of hate and that's not the teachings of jesus it was about love and

801
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,840
empathy and kindness and taking care of the poor and the weak and the sick so this book kind of

802
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:59,000
bolsters those ideas while calling out the rampant hypocrisy that's grown up around it

803
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:05,640
yeah there's a lot there's a lot to talk about there you know one of the things that's really

804
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:10,280
interesting to me about that whole era of human history is that you have like the bible that's

805
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:19,000
based on the gospels of those guys mark uh john forget the rest of them anyways there's but there's

806
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:25,800
so much more text and history in that area that is not included and it's purposely ignored there's

807
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:35,400
there's comedians that existed from 100 bc to 100 ad there's physicians and doctors that existed

808
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:40,920
these and poets that existed and all these people wrote extensively about what was going on that

809
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:46,440
gives you a lot of context to what was happening in those times and when you talk to like classicists

810
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:52,200
or linguists that's how they figure out what words mean so there's like this thing called

811
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:57,000
semantic drift like if you take the timeline of history one word can mean something totally

812
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:03,080
different in 1500 bc than what it means in 1500 ad right so that's how that's why they take every

813
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:10,600
single bit of writing and art or whatever it is that they can find drawings on temple ceilings

814
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,920
to figure out what things meant to figure out the context what was really happening

815
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,000
in that part of that part of history yeah i've never heard that term before but it makes a lot

816
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,120
of a lot of sense yeah semantic drift semantic drift yeah that's cool yeah similar to genetic

817
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:28,680
drift so yeah one of the examples that guy almond hillman brought up on the show is uh the word

818
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:34,840
laystace is an ancient greek word that's that's it's experienced a lot of semantic drift over time

819
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:39,400
and in the bible it's used to describe when jesus was arrested in the park he says i'm not a

820
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:48,440
laystace biblical scholars like to say that laystace means a revolutionary yeah but

821
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:56,440
caesar was captured by child traffickers and when he was captured by them and when he eventually

822
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:04,200
uh got set free well i think they had to like they paid a bounty to for the captors the pirates or

823
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:10,120
the traffickers that caught him and he eventually got set free he crucified them and he called them

824
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:15,560
he literally this is like documented he called them laystace so they were child kidnappers

825
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:21,880
traffickers and he crucified them and that's this guy saying that caesar used the word laystace as

826
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:26,280
a child trafficker and jesus said he was not a laystace when he was arrested in the park this

827
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:30,440
is less than a hundred years apart as he's as a child running away and he has barely any clothes

828
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:36,920
on exactly the naked kid running away yeah so take for that that's interesting context an important

829
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:41,160
context that's left out of the narrative because it doesn't not only left out but biblical scholars

830
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:47,640
go out of their way to basically change the meaning of shit right yeah i know it's uh there's some

831
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:54,200
muddy waters even i tweeted recently um about i don't want this to get political because i'm

832
01:15:54,200 --> 01:16:00,200
largely apolitical i've given up on all that shit because it's hopeless um but but in the first the

833
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:04,520
the other two that you were talking about matthew and luke i think were the other ones but in the

834
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:10,840
first book matthew the very first section of it there's all this stuff about sex and adultery

835
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:15,560
and violence and yeah and it's like well this is the text this is what you're reading growing up

836
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:20,680
is being into my head as a kid i was raised in a fundamentalist christian household and you know

837
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,520
i'm being taught that women belong in the kitchen and all of these things about

838
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:29,800
racial superiority and stuff i'm like that that can't be in this book you know is this really what

839
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:34,280
we're being taught i started to reflect on as i got older jesus christ a lot of that is in the book

840
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:40,120
yeah but there's also crazy shit about prostitutes and oh yeah children and slaughtering children

841
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:46,200
like literally going going in and slaughtering women and keeping like i've been reading the

842
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,720
bible on and off like the last few months because i've really been getting into it recently from the

843
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:53,800
gas that i've had in and there's a part that i just listened to i'm listening to audio bible

844
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:58,040
that talks about how they would go in kill all the women and children and boys but they would

845
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:02,920
keep like the pre-pubescent girls that were virgins because they could breed with them and

846
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:07,480
that's dar four that's what happened in the genocide in dar four and many other conflicts

847
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:13,080
throughout the world it's yeah it's weird you know and i'm not it's also full of contradictions too

848
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:18,200
like there's tons of of timeline contradictions especially when it comes to noah and and some of

849
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:23,320
the things that happen yeah and and you know i'm not i'm not here to bash the bible or any religion

850
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:29,080
per se i only bring it up because there is something to be said for the original teachings

851
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:35,720
of this one individual this historical figure jesus you know and i and i i i did hold on to

852
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:42,840
those parts i'm i'm yeah it's more a religious than i am apolitical these days but i do remember

853
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:47,080
those parts framework and i think there's something to that and especially in the context of where

854
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:52,680
we're going as a species and maybe it was the intent was to introduce those ideas of empathy

855
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:57,960
and love for others and taking care of others and into this time 2000 plus years ago and that was

856
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:02,760
supposed to take off and resonate failed experiment if that was the case because everybody just took

857
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:07,400
out swords and started fighting each other over these different prophets and ideas and you know

858
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:12,840
who's a prophet who's not a prophet right but but what if you know that is the future of humanity

859
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:19,240
what if they sent back this highly evolved highly conscious highly empathetic individual

860
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:24,600
to carry out this mission that would help move us in that direction to become more like them

861
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:32,040
to evolve our consciousness even more did it work no but you could see how that might be something

862
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:36,120
they would try to do but then it gets into questions like are we just in some kind of

863
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:40,520
simulation are we an experiment are they just throwing things in here and there can we even

864
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,800
change the past did they already know what was going to happen if we're in a block universe

865
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:48,440
model there's that i'm not saying that's the case it's just a fun thought experiment and it's a big

866
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:54,440
part of what this book was is to sort of think about a lot of religious lore in the context of

867
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:59,160
real contact with future humans and what the intention behind that might have been and what

868
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:04,600
the ramifications of those interjections might have been as well right and there's also a point in

869
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:14,280
the the the extra-tempestrial model book where the two brothers they basically came across a

870
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:19,160
flying saucer that was just had these these two dudes who didn't look like great aliens they

871
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:24,120
looked like humans like exercising outside the ship and they brought it like they came back a

872
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:30,440
bunch of times like weeks weeks apart and they eventually brought them in and showed them stuff

873
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:35,480
answered all their questions gave them a tour except one except one question they asked them

874
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:41,320
about jesus right and that was the one question they could not answer i find that fascinating

875
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:47,160
jeff crapo actually i was at a conference with him at the eslin institute in 2022 and he had a

876
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:52,120
little powerpoint introducing every like the the main things we're going to talk about in this

877
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:59,080
group of phd's at this really iconic uh place in the cliff sides outside of big sir and he brought

878
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:05,480
that up in his little slide he brought up uh astin walt and i forget his name but the guy who

879
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:12,360
interviewed uh leo dorshak about about this interaction but he brought that up specifically

880
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,600
like this was the one question they answered all his questions about electromagnetism language

881
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:22,920
travel through space and time but they wouldn't talk about jesus and jeff was like we all need

882
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:27,800
to think about that what does that mean whether they're extraterrestrial time travelers whatever

883
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:32,120
what does that mean he pulled out the importance of that too and i'm glad you did because i think

884
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:37,960
i think it is really telling and ties into what i was just talking about like how do these things

885
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:43,560
relate if they are future humans and they are coming back they must be aware they've they've

886
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:48,360
yeah if they can go back from from hundreds of thousands of years in the future to now

887
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,600
they could certainly go back to and they must be aware that it's influencing our cultures

888
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:58,360
tremendously cranial cranial uh morphine the cranial boarding intentional cranial modification

889
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:04,280
is the technical term for it we see this across the world and through time and almost every major

890
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:08,200
civilization throughout the world and a lot of small ones even the enderthals might have done it

891
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:13,960
but why why are they why are they forcing their children's head which must have been tremendously

892
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:19,800
painful yeah why are they doing this unless there's some huge reason for it and even there was a

893
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:25,240
study in 1995 where they interviewed people why are you doing this because our ancestors were

894
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:31,160
instructed by the gods to do it is what they said who are these gods the gods if they're future

895
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:35,880
humans if they're aliens whether they're future human or not have big round heads how do you get

896
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:41,560
that shape you squish your head from front to back so yeah there's so many things the cave paintings

897
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:46,120
with the there's just there's so many and and if they're doing that and it's influencing these

898
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:52,680
cultures if it's influencing and creating the major religions of the world how do they see that

899
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:57,480
how do they see what they're doing that ain't your star trek non-interference prime directive

900
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:03,800
type shit they're clearly influencing the past and present and potentially their own future in ways

901
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:08,520
but there's so many questions i i don't have an answer i just it's something i've been thinking

902
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:13,640
about lately and it kind of makes my brain hurt so if they asked him i don't know what they asked

903
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:17,960
is jesus real or is religion is all the stuff real i mean i guess that would be the i forget

904
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:23,720
the exact phrase you know something like that though yeah if it was real and they knew it was

905
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:29,960
real why would they not answer however if it was not real and they told the kids it was not real

906
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:35,080
you would seem that would have to that would be that would affect us more i played the fifth they

907
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:39,320
just played the fifth and moved on yeah right no that's a good point they break it down even

908
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:49,720
more like yeah how does that aversion factor in in both cases real or not real yeah i had eric

909
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:54,200
wargo in here and he was explaining to me yeah yeah he's great he has the whole time loops

910
01:22:54,840 --> 01:23:00,920
theory which is amazing um there's he was explaining to me and i don't remember it

911
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:07,720
perfectly but there's like a time travel paradox basically or a paradox too if we go back in time

912
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:12,040
and we affect ourselves it's going to basically affect them in the future so they can't exist

913
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:18,840
and that's that that all ties into the block universe versus multi the multiverse yeah eric

914
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:25,400
is his big time team block universe for sure and and i am too for the most part only because

915
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:31,880
it is the dominant paradigm to explain time and time travel and can you for people for the

916
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:35,480
limit can you explain the basic differences between the block universe right right sure

917
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:42,920
so in the block universe model and i always i always recommend an article i think her name

918
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:48,920
is dr christy miller at the university of adelaide maybe it's in austria but she wrote this great

919
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:55,000
concise article very layman's terms helps explain if people want to look that up i'll do a short

920
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,760
one here the block universe is basically the idea that all moments from the very beginning of the

921
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:06,760
big bang to the very last bit of matter leaving this universe and likely going back to start the

922
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:15,160
big bang because i think it's cyclic um all of those moments are structured as sort of static

923
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:22,440
stationary and a four-dimensional block so if you move between those you're not changing anything

924
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:26,680
you're just connecting different parts of that block it's also called landscape time occasionally

925
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:31,640
because it's easier for us to factor out one dimension so think of all of time and all of

926
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:37,160
the moments throughout history past present future is being on the static sheet you can jump to

927
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:42,280
another part within that but it's not going to affect anything about where you came from what

928
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:49,320
you're doing if you go into the past is basically just interacting in the way you always had and

929
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:53,880
there's not going to be a change because when you get back you find that you had just done what you

930
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:59,960
are always going to do so there's no paradox in the block universe because there's no change

931
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:05,000
you're interjecting yourself you're doing the things i think in her article yeah she's talking

932
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:10,200
about you're walking around you're petting donkeys and you know eating lunch and interacting with

933
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:14,520
people but you're not changing anything you're just doing what you'd always done in that period

934
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:18,200
it just took you to go back to do it another thing that helps people sometimes is to think

935
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:23,640
about meeting yourself so if you go back say you're 40 years old you go back to when you were 10

936
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:28,760
you get out of this disc-shaped time machine and you go up and say hey i'm you from the future oh

937
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:34,200
cool nice to meet you got any advice don't date rose she was bad for you okay dale don't don't

938
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:38,920
race today dale don't race today what was that for i'd go back and tell dale on heart not to get

939
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:44,440
oh yeah right right yeah but see that's the thing is you can't change anything in the block universe

940
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:49,000
and and one of the saddest things for me when i started doing this and writing about it and

941
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:55,320
talking publicly in 2018 and 19 i never thought in my life i would have people writing me

942
01:25:55,320 --> 01:26:01,720
asking me how to save their their dead child or their lost father relative or something it was

943
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:06,440
tremendously sad like that was not on my radar at all i thought i'd lose my job and people would

944
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:11,400
hate me for other things related to this but i never thought i would have to like try to help

945
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:16,760
people who are suffering tremendous loss from something they wanted to change unfortunately

946
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:21,240
in the block universe you can't change those things those moments are structured that way

947
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:25,080
so everything's predetermined essentially yeah here's a good way of looking at here

948
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:30,760
i don't want to don't want to say that but that is one of the because i hate mail man they come

949
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:34,520
after me they come after me hard when i just delete it you don't have to read it yeah there's

950
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:41,000
there's that's one of the implications of this some people see that as an issue i don't i actually

951
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,760
kind of like it i call it i call it feel will because it feels like we have free will who cares

952
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:49,160
if we do or we don't right and there's all these studies like the limit study showing we don't even

953
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:54,280
know what we're doing until after we do it we don't we don't have conscious awareness of our

954
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:59,320
actions until milliseconds after it actually happens another thing this is the big hang up

955
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:03,960
for people and i think this helps folks are out there head around the block universe is that if

956
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:07,640
you look to the past you can see all these things that might have happened in your life but there's

957
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:12,680
just one timeline there's one world line for you and everybody else we look to the future and we

958
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:17,960
say oh there's all these infinite possibilities anything could happen but if you're looking back

959
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:24,120
from 100 years in that future but they see the one line they see the only one thing actually

960
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:30,680
happened all of those possibilities converged into one world line for the universe and that's

961
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:35,480
essentially what this is it's looking back at the end of the universe and seeing that one line that

962
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:40,440
played out in this universe there was one history you can move around within it it's not changing

963
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:46,440
anything it's not like you come back and it rains donuts and and cats are dogs and dogs are cats

964
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:49,320
it's that everything is still the same you just went and did what you're gonna do

965
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:56,360
versus the multiverse many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is one of the the more

966
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:02,120
dominant models here where if you go back into the past it creates this quantum decoherence and now

967
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:06,680
you have two different timelines it bifurcates the timeline and there's issues with the law of

968
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:14,040
conservation of mass how can you just double this huge universe and all of the mass within it into

969
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:19,000
two different things there's other issues too but that's one of the big ones so in that model you

970
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,480
could have different timelines and i've often said that i think the interdimensional theory

971
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:27,320
and the intertemporal theory this extra tempestual are essentially one in the same

972
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:33,640
but basically this interdimensional one of the versions focuses more on jumping timelines

973
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:37,800
whereas this extra tempestual model because it is the most dominant paradigm that we understand

974
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:43,320
in philosophy and physics looks at it in the context of the navikov self-consistency principle

975
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:50,040
that all things remain the same there is no change you're just interacting with the block universe

976
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:55,000
in all of these different ways it's not creating new timelines it's not creating change there is

977
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,760
no paradox so i mostly focused on that because it's what we know is it wrong we'll find out in

978
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:07,320
the future i don't know but i can only base the things i write about on our current knowledge

979
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:15,480
of physics and philosophy right yeah that was um super compelling piece of your book when you talk

980
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:21,160
about um interstellar travel so like the time dilation that occurs when you travel at the

981
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:26,440
speed of light so like if we eventually figure out light speed travel and i think you made the

982
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:30,520
case in your book that it takes like 22 years to travel from like the edge of the universe to the

983
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:36,040
center of the universe or something like that in rocket time rocket time 11 years to the center

984
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:40,920
from the edge 22 22 from edge to edge of the universe yeah or to the center and back from

985
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:46,120
is that traveling at like light speed or what what speed is that yeah like 99.99999 percent

986
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:51,320
um but yeah so that's 100 000 years on earth time right or something like there are no from like

987
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:57,560
edge to edge it was like two million years right no it was 100 000 yeah so an 11 22 year round

988
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:06,040
trip and this is based on god i'm spacing his name um but yeah a well-known physicist

989
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:14,200
did these calculations i i don't have the capacity to do that math but yeah he said that um 11

990
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:20,840
22 year round trip in your ship you know very doable you could survive that um would be

991
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:26,680
100 000 years on earth based on the basic time dilation einstein's 1905 paper i think it was

992
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:31,480
called the electrodynamics of moving bodies or something like that yeah which is it's it's it's

993
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:36,200
displayed nicely in interstellar how you know he goes off and he comes back and his daughter is

994
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:41,960
like 90 years old exactly yeah and the argument i made is that if we're going to do interstellar

995
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:47,320
travel we're also everybody yeah we're going to need to also conquer backward time travel right

996
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:51,240
because you don't want to just get back to your planet and have everybody be dead you want to

997
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:57,880
get back to your time too it's hilarious how you explained that if we if we sent a crew of

998
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:03,320
astronauts out to explore the edge of the galaxy and they were 25 years into their trip yeah and

999
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:09,480
then all of a sudden like a set of astronauts pulled up next to them in like 10 minutes with

1000
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:15,320
their belly full of breakfast that wasn't that wasn't mine i pulled that a guy was writing about

1001
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:21,560
my book yeah on um medium and he those were his words yeah i was quoting him and i can't remember

1002
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:25,480
his name trevor or something that's hilarious because he put that so well i loved that they're

1003
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:31,160
in a 25 year trip to the edge of the galaxy but that's really like a hundred thousand years on

1004
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:35,320
earth which we can easily develop technology that's so much more advanced by then and they

1005
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:38,440
could travel probably 10 times and it was a great point one that i hadn't even thought of

1006
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:41,800
yeah as soon as i read that i was like damn that's a really good point you know because

1007
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:47,880
yeah if if things are speeding up on earth what's the point of even trying to send somebody out

1008
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:52,040
because they're gonna get all this way in this very fancy technology and then you just catch

1009
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:56,200
right up to them right because everything's going so fast back on earth and i had never even thought

1010
01:31:56,200 --> 01:32:01,880
about that but trevor mahoney i think was his name um but he he phrases it really well too and

1011
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:06,920
and like you have implications of that it would be pointless people catch up like shit seriously

1012
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:12,440
doing this my whole is my life's work and they're just whizzing by me yeah that's such a paradox

1013
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:15,640
because it would be it's it would render it pointless yeah right because you spend your

1014
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:20,520
whole life traveling and then earth just catches up and you're here like in this primitive spaceship

1015
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:27,080
what's the point yeah but at what point do you do it with that in mind you know like where do you

1016
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:31,320
draw the line because at some point you're going to want to do it right right well it would make

1017
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:36,360
sense that we would want to figure out time travel first we could go back and get back true true

1018
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:40,920
yeah that's back to that time in our life yeah because then you already know you can go forward

1019
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:46,600
yeah and and actually a friend of mine uh san ali agrama he's a professor of anthropology as

1020
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:51,960
well at the university of chicago but he made a little cameo in that book he's the guy that

1021
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:56,360
i had in there proposing the the super technological singularity like people talk

1022
01:32:56,360 --> 01:33:01,720
about a singularity in ai yeah but he's saying like if these are future humans at some point

1023
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:08,520
if we know who they are and we have access to all of the knowledge of the future we instantly

1024
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:13,960
become part of that like it's the singularity where all of the information all the technology

1025
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:18,440
is available to us and we could solve so many problems we could cure all these diseases we

1026
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:24,440
would be them instantly it's pretty wild to think about but i think he makes a solid point

1027
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:29,240
that is pretty wild to think about are there people that think that when i think a lot of

1028
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:33,320
people speculate that the singularity is going to happen in like the 2030s 2040s

1029
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:38,920
do people ever talk about when we might be able to figure out time travel or actually experiment

1030
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:45,400
with time travel well what's interesting is that if time travel exists we have time travel at all

1031
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:51,640
points in the past that that can reach so there really is no point where time travel becomes

1032
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:58,120
new essentially because think about it like we say we don't have time travel yet but it exists

1033
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:02,920
100 years in our future someone from 100 years in our future can come back and pick us up now

1034
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:07,960
and take us to whatever point in the past they want to we didn't have it now but because it's

1035
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:12,680
accessible to the people in the future that do it's also accessible to us it's kind of the same thing

1036
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:18,120
is that super technological singularity where all of these things and these capabilities become

1037
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:22,760
available to us at whatever point they decide to let us know and that may be a part of what this

1038
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:26,920
disclosure movement is too is shifting us toward that because finally we're not

1039
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:32,600
the the humans trying to have a conversation with ants we're the humans trying to have a

1040
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:37,480
conversation with more advanced humans so do you think the like the these government programs

1041
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:41,080
where they have these crashed vehicles or these reverse engineering programs these are time

1042
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:48,040
machines that they have and yeah and i think about it too like um if they are say say this

1043
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:53,160
time machine crashed in roswell let's just use the roswell example okay it's people see this

1044
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:57,720
as a paradox too even though it's also not paradoxical in a block universe but if you go

1045
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:04,280
back in time and crash this thing outside the desert of roswell 1947 those people didn't create

1046
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:07,960
that thing it crashed into there but they're reverse engineering it they're figuring out how

1047
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:13,640
to use it and how to make it and how to fly it and how it manipulates space time and eventually

1048
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:18,520
you develop that same machine that goes back and crashes in 1947 starts it over goes back it's

1049
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:23,800
this infinite time loop of self-consistent events that are connected across two different points

1050
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:28,760
in the block universe but where the paradox comes from it's called the bootstrap paradox

1051
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:33,480
is because people think there has to be an origin point there has to be a creator they say who

1052
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:39,240
created it must be a paradox doesn't matter that thing's always existed in those bookended

1053
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:44,440
connected points in space time the people in the past didn't create it because it crashed into

1054
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:48,280
their time people in the future didn't create it because it took the reverse engineering of

1055
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:53,400
the people who added initially to create that thing so it's like i always say it's like looking

1056
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:57,720
for a corner on a rounded ball there is no corner because it's not a block it's a ball

1057
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:03,960
it doesn't matter it's just always existed but it violates our fragile sensibilities about linear

1058
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:08,200
time and cause and effect one of the first things we do in kindergarten is we're given

1059
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:12,200
little things we got to cut out the paper and then put them in order we're taught from a very

1060
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:17,480
young age brainwashed almost that linear time is all there is not the case when you have backward

1061
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:25,000
time travel capabilities and why do you think these things technically and physically

1062
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:31,480
can work as time machines because i mean there's been the cases made in the book from the guys who

1063
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:36,600
are given there was one guy who saw the thing hovering above a lake or a river or something

1064
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,960
like that and he basically showed him the schematics and how the thing operated and you

1065
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:45,240
claim that that's how a time machine would work who do artena yeah well what they told him is

1066
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:54,440
that they were extracting hydrogen from the water in order to power it i guess i don't know or had

1067
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:59,240
something to do with their power system again these were human human looking things entirely

1068
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:06,360
human entirely humans they spoke to him verbally they said they spoke 500 languages i make an

1069
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:12,040
interesting correlation in that book because the case study right before it was mike and leo

1070
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:19,640
dorshak in south dakota the one with udore ortena was in um outside of helena montana not far from

1071
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:24,440
where i live and they both claimed to have spoken 500 languages came out of ships that looked very

1072
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:29,480
similar had very similar appearances in clothing i wonder if maybe they were the same if there was

1073
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:34,840
the same group they just happened to come across these two different groups of individuals but that

1074
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:39,640
makes sense you could use the oxygen to breathe and you could use the hydrogen for power i kind

1075
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:44,440
of feel that maybe they're using something more like they've cracked the case on zero point energy

1076
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:50,760
cold fusion perhaps because they're going to need a lot of energy to do this in any case um

1077
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:59,240
yeah so so it seems that the craft themselves as i mentioned earlier the we have this

1078
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:03,640
expression in biology that form follows function and you can use this with anything you can look

1079
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:08,760
at the form of a fork and think well that probably stabs something to eat you know you can watch

1080
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:14,040
people use it obviously and get more information but the form of these crafts seem to indicate the

1081
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:19,000
function of backward time travel so what i did because i don't understand how to backward time

1082
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,640
travel i'm an anthropologist nobody understands how to do that what i did is i started with

1083
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:29,560
einstein's 1915 paper on general relativity his first one in 1905 was on special relativity we

1084
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:37,000
just talked about the twin paradox also not a paradox but uh how time and space are relative

1085
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:43,240
that was the point of the electrodynamics a moving body's paper in 1915 he talked about how there's

1086
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:49,400
a curvature of space time which was largely developed in association with his mentor minkowski

1087
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:55,160
minkowski space time it's our four-dimensional the the same understanding that we have today

1088
01:38:55,960 --> 01:39:01,400
um so it's relative when you travel at a high rate of speed like we were talking about right

1089
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:05,480
before we started back up everything's compressed you're going away from the earth and it looks

1090
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:10,120
like everything stops you look back and everything's just frozen because you're moving at the same speed

1091
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:15,560
as the light that left earth at that same time as you turn around and come back you're now blasting

1092
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:20,760
through all of those moments that you had missed as you were traveling and then a whole bunch more

1093
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:25,720
because you compress space and time so by the time you get back everybody's much older as we

1094
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:32,200
just talked about so with the curvature of space time his 1915 paper very soon after he published

1095
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:37,880
that there were solutions to the field equations he published that showed with the rotation of a

1096
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:44,440
highly massive and or energetic at first it was a universe or the earth initially just any sort of

1097
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:50,280
massive spinning body lens in theory and i think in 1918 demonstrated and it's pretty common if

1098
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:55,960
you put like a bowling ball in oil or molasses and spin it the oil and molasses start spinning with

1099
01:39:55,960 --> 01:40:03,160
it so it's that rotational energy that can create what's called closed time like curves it can bend

1100
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:08,120
over light cones and a good way of thinking of light cones is if you turn on a flashlight

1101
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:13,160
okay you just flip it on real fast turn it off the light can only move out in this direction

1102
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:17,640
nothing can move faster than light so anything within that light cone is moving with it

1103
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:23,240
so it's always going from past to future however with this rotational energy which

1104
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:30,280
lenz and thuring showed 1918 then godel showed with a rotating universe essentially that that

1105
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:36,040
creates the same tipping over of light cones so when you tip over the light cones and they go far

1106
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:41,320
enough now the past is also at play like you're still moving forward you're still obeying the

1107
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:48,600
laws of physics but you're able to move into the past carry that forward van stockem in the

1108
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:56,840
1970s 1950s i think and then importantly frank tipler in the 1970s showed that if you shrink down

1109
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:02,440
this galaxy of essentially but an infinite galaxy is what van stockem and godel had argued that you

1110
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:09,320
need this infinite mass tipler showed if you shrink that down to a ring sphere or importantly a disc

1111
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:16,440
of finite size you can create that same warpage of space time and the same bending over of light

1112
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:20,600
cones in order to travel into the past and this is why i say that form follows function because

1113
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:27,000
that's essentially what a ufo looks like the cylindrical disc shaped ufos it's this rapidly

1114
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:33,880
spinning disc that seemingly can manipulate space time so even beyond that in my second book i tie

1115
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:40,760
in a number of cases where space and time is manipulated you have corporal armando valdez in

1116
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:48,600
1977 he walks in the proximity of this craft he's gone for 15 minutes based on what his men see this

1117
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:54,120
are the different reference frames when he emerges he's weak he's got a beard and his watch reads

1118
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:59,720
five days in the future so for him he was gone five days to his men he was gone 15 minutes

1119
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:04,200
and there's case after case like that and i try to highlight a number of them in the extra

1120
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:09,720
tempestual model because it it demonstrates that what is happening these things might be time

1121
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:14,760
machines themselves that they're able to manipulate space time if things like that are happening and

1122
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:20,040
they're in control of it what's keeping them from going back into the past and you know based on

1123
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:26,360
the fermi paradox he famously said if there's all these aliens where are they this potentially helps

1124
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:31,240
explain it that we are seeing future humans that if they are going into the past why don't we see

1125
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:39,640
them i think we are and i think they're inside the ufos whoa so the people so the people that

1126
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:45,560
go on board these crafts they can somehow who's ever manipulating them they can somehow

1127
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:52,440
make time stand still or they can some or no they don't make time stand still but they're

1128
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:59,160
i don't i don't understand why time would move faster like where are they going

1129
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:06,920
i think what's happening is that inside the craft everything is extremely normal everything feels

1130
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:13,480
normal right time moves as you would experience now at the speed of life you could say but there's

1131
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:18,600
this what what jim penniston called a sphere of influence around it when he went and approached

1132
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:24,600
the craft in the rendlesham forest in 1980 all of a sudden he described as walking through water

1133
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:29,800
like everything was different he felt like his movements were more labored and time was moving

1134
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:36,120
differently it's seemingly what's happening is that there is this sphere of influence and

1135
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:41,240
corporal amando valdez crossed it he walked into that sphere of influence time he disappeared

1136
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:48,760
because if you um i think in my now that's my first book sorry i think um once he crossed that

1137
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:53,160
you would expect him to disappear in the same way that these ufos pop in and out of existence they

1138
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:57,800
appear and disappear and to go back to something that i accidentally skipped over earlier when we

1139
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:02,920
were talking about the super highway how nasa says it's incredibly quiet in space yeah steve

1140
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:10,440
mera uh ufo researcher in the uk pointed out why is that you know what does that mean we would

1141
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:15,000
expect to see the super highway they're constantly coming and going from outer space if they're from

1142
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:20,520
outer space but what we actually see is them popping in and out of our four-dimensional

1143
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:24,440
frame of reference which is exactly what we'd expect to see of a time machine it would appear

1144
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:29,720
and disappear as it moves into the future or past and that's the same thing that seems to be

1145
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:33,720
happening here and as it was pointed out to me after i published my first book by someone who

1146
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:39,400
claimed to be an intelligence agent who was really concerned that i understand what he was saying he

1147
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:42,840
wrote me the first time i was like oh that's cool and he could tell i didn't understand what the hell

1148
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:48,280
he was talking about wrote me again like no i really think you need to hear what i'm saying

1149
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:54,200
but what he pointed out which seemed very obvious once he said it is that when we see these craft

1150
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:59,560
doing these right angle turns at tens of thousands of miles an hour

1151
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:06,520
the g forces would be five to ten thousand g's nothing could survive that right but what he

1152
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:12,520
pointed out to me is that the way in which they're manipulating space time just creates the illusion

1153
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:18,360
of them moving that fast and that they use this speed to mask themselves they slow everything down

1154
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:24,760
speed up their frame of reference as we perceive it in order to do these things so that 90 degree

1155
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:29,560
turn may be one g to them but because of the manipulation of space time and these different

1156
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:35,800
reference frames inside that sphere of influence for them versus outside of it for us we see this

1157
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:40,680
is some incredible maneuver that would squash anything inside when in fact that's just a

1158
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:46,280
perception differential it's a difference in the way we perceive what's happening versus how they

1159
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:53,160
perceive it because they manipulate space time in and around these craft okay that's not my

1160
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:58,520
information that was given to me by someone who claims to be an ex uh intelligence officer

1161
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:02,440
somebody that just emailed you out of the blue yeah but it makes a lot of damn sense it makes

1162
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:07,160
perfect sense and if we slow there's so many cases where something will zip across the sky

1163
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:12,120
you slow it down and you can see the craft doing this and they might use it they might use it to

1164
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:16,680
protect themselves too if we start shooting at them these bullets which seemingly are going you

1165
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:20,920
know 700 miles an hour a thousand miles an hour to us they're like we should probably move over

1166
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:25,880
here because they're shooting at us again um so it just it makes a lot of sense yeah you know

1167
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:30,200
that's also it was described i think with uh fravor right he said that like the thing went

1168
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:33,560
showed up at his cat point yeah or whatever they knew the future yeah

1169
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:39,480
yeah that's an interesting one too is it kind of like that one

1170
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:44,680
quick silver scene and x-men i've never seen that i haven't seen that either

1171
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:49,160
i'm more of a marvel let's watch it and get this uh episode copywritten

1172
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:57,160
just don't show it on the screen yeah is it the same with video if you show less than 15 seconds

1173
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:02,120
and you don't have to get the rights i don't know usually if you show anything yeah exactly

1174
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:07,000
or like the matrix too you know when he's dodging the bullets he just slows time down and

1175
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:14,360
yeah yeah that's a perfect that's a perfect metaphor steve exactly that's okay so that's

1176
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:18,360
what he's that's what he's claiming and as soon as he said that i was like jesus yeah that makes so

1177
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:22,840
much sense and i included that in my second book because i thought it was highly relevant to this

1178
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:23,560
conversation

1179
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:30,200
and if they're time travelers they absolutely have the ability to do this

1180
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:35,800
you know and in whatever capacity they want and i list the case of linda jones where she's running

1181
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:42,680
and the grass is growing at like four six feet all around her as she's running um you have a study

1182
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:47,720
that was done where travis walton was abducted and the trees in the vicinity of where he was taken

1183
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:53,880
grew 20 times faster than the trees just outside of that circle so again inside the craft once you

1184
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:58,760
cross over that threshold i think everything is how they perceive time but there's this

1185
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:01,000
disconnect between their reference frame in our room

1186
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:09,720
and travis walton also when he came when he finally got found out when he when he came back it was

1187
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:14,840
like a couple days later he had like a beard grown out and uh his watch that one could be that he

1188
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:19,960
was just gone that long it was also about five days i think on earth yeah earth time yeah because

1189
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:26,120
he he was in a bad state like he he sees it as an ambulance call basically like they zapped him good

1190
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:31,560
unintentionally and interestingly the case with um mike and leo dorshak in south dakota north dakota

1191
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:37,160
i forget which um they specifically said we need to ground the ship before you touch it because

1192
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:41,240
they're little boys they want to be like what's this can i touch it and they were like all right

1193
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:46,200
but yeah we need to ground it first really yeah and then travis just ran up on it he's like cool

1194
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:51,800
ufo so he ran up on it got zapped by this electromagnetic discharge and when he woke up

1195
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:55,800
there are these two little grays around him and he's had all this medical equipment on him so

1196
01:48:55,800 --> 01:49:02,200
seemingly he had sort of an emergency room visit based on what happened it would take time to heal

1197
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:07,560
so i don't know if that was a manipulation space time i think it was just gone that long

1198
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:11,240
but one of the last cases in the book which you'll probably remember if you just read it

1199
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:19,480
was the one of amy rylance in uh i think gondia australia oh yeah where she was gone for what she

1200
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:24,600
claims was a week seven days in the presence of this man she doesn't call him an alien she calls

1201
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:29,240
him a man and there was a witness to this one though there was a witness her friend petra

1202
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:34,920
came out because there was a storm it woke her up she sees amy being taken out through the window

1203
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:43,640
into this large cylindrical disc-shaped craft and disappears freaks out husband wakes up freaks out

1204
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:49,320
starts running around where'd she go abducted by aliens whatever not the case eventually is like

1205
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:56,120
seriously where'd she go and um yeah they call the cops and this is an interesting one for a

1206
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:02,760
couple reasons uh i'll finish the story and then i'll try to backtrack into why i find it fascinating

1207
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:11,000
but she ended up about 790 kilometers away in mckay an hour and a half after she was taken

1208
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:17,720
so what that indicates to me is that and they told her we're going to drop you off somewhere

1209
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:21,960
different we're going to put you somewhere else because we can't go back to the original place

1210
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:28,200
we took you there's cops everywhere right but they did drop her off closer to the time at which she

1211
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:34,440
was taken and i think because her husband and friend were freaking out like it almost seems

1212
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:40,600
like an empathetic nice thing to do you know if she was gone for seven days they have the ability

1213
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:45,080
to travel back in time they didn't drop her off seven days after they were done hanging out with

1214
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:50,040
her doing whatever they were doing they took her back to an hour and a half after she was taken

1215
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:52,280
to drop her off closer to that moment in time

1216
01:50:55,800 --> 01:51:00,200
yeah that's wild man this uh it seems like the most compelling

1217
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:05,960
the most compelling explanation for for what these things are and you know the other weird thing is

1218
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:11,160
like why i asked uh witley this too but like it seems like this stuff stopped happening after

1219
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:17,000
the 90s like nobody else like the stuff people stop reporting these encounters the hybrid stuff

1220
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:24,840
for sure and i think he even says that it's part of their their sort of gene harvesting program

1221
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:30,840
and maybe that's part of some contract i i used to think it sounded crazy and then after grush

1222
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:35,560
came out and you know people talking about the eisenhower meetings and all this stuff if you

1223
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:41,000
get enough of these in your brain you can't not think about them or try to put the pieces together

1224
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,720
try to find patterns yes and essentially with that one you know and hearing witley talk about it too

1225
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:51,400
there seems to have been some sort of agreement i and i understand this sounds insane but there

1226
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:57,160
seems to have been some sort of agreement where they needed our genetic material maybe because

1227
01:51:57,160 --> 01:52:01,560
of the things we talked about earlier who knows but there was a period of time in which they did

1228
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:08,920
it seemingly from like the 70s to the early 90s maybe even to the early 2000s yeah that's what

1229
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:14,120
willy says okay he thinks it ended i mean who knows right but he thinks it ended in the the early

1230
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:22,040
the early 80s but one has to also wonder if you take that little bit of evidence if we

1231
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:25,960
can count it as that obviously the standards of evidence don't apply to anything that we're

1232
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:31,640
talking about but if we can take that data point let's say and look at it in the context of what

1233
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:38,360
people also feel is an impending cataclysm or some sort of massive shift that will affect all of

1234
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:44,840
humanity are they trying to get as much genetic material as they can while it still exists

1235
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:51,960
before that bottleneck occurs that scares the shit out of me to tell you the truth

1236
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:58,120
because why focus on that period what is it about our genes now and a lot of native americans too

1237
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:02,680
a ton of native americans have these sorts of interactions and they have more wild type genes

1238
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:07,240
than you know a lot of people from other parts of the world have been sailing around and are

1239
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:11,800
breeding with other groups yeah they're like wolves compared to us and australian aborigines

1240
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:15,240
too if you look at a lateral radiograph of an australian aborigines what's a lateral

1241
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:21,960
radiograph a side view of an x-ray okay if you look at their skulls from the side in an x-ray

1242
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:28,760
they're very very similar to homo erectus which makes sense genetic isolation on that island

1243
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:33,000
they didn't go on to interbreed with a lot of other groups and places that were developing

1244
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:41,960
derived characteristics is why we have egg laying mammals in on that side of the the wallace zone

1245
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:48,280
yeah and it's interesting because those genes would naturally be more important in the context

1246
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:53,640
of diversity because they're untouched they're more pure i guess in the sense that if you're

1247
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:59,800
coming back through time to get genetic material to help diversify your gene pool in the future

1248
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:05,800
solve genetic problems those indigenous populations all throughout the americas and

1249
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:10,840
other places sub-saharan africa australia new zealand those may be of even greater import and

1250
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:20,280
you do find story after story in the cultural lore of these various groups yes and how do we also not

1251
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:24,360
know that they're they continue to do this in the future too like just because they stopped in the

1252
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:29,640
2000s maybe they took like a 20-year break and then started doing it again in like the 2030s

1253
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:33,480
maybe i mean you definitely don't hear about it as much anymore you definitely don't hear about it

1254
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:37,880
and that's all we have i mean it's not like someone's out there with a video camera recording these so

1255
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:43,400
all we really have is people's accounts and i honestly yeah it does seem like it fell off

1256
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:51,400
in in the zeros the whole narrative in the ufo community or the government or whatever it is it

1257
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:58,040
seems to be like a very big push to people want to conflate these things with angels and demons and

1258
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:08,360
the bible sure i like i seem to agree with what georgiani said about that is that if we were to

1259
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:18,280
make this whatever it is publicly known society or whoever in charge of society the united states

1260
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:24,760
government would want to put something in place that would bolster christianity or sort of reinforced

1261
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:31,640
christianity um in the case that if some sort of crazy technological thing would become known to

1262
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:38,600
the world that it could have the potential to destroy religion yeah well maybe not destroy it

1263
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:45,480
so much as reshape it or allow people different avenues which they can use to think about it i

1264
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:50,760
mean that that again was probably the biggest theme in this most recent book i wrote and the

1265
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:57,480
reason i did it as a science fiction novel satirical one at that um is to explore some

1266
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:02,840
of these things you just can't talk about in a grounded scientific publication but i feel

1267
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:08,600
like that's going to be the next big issue is religion it shapes so much of the day-to-day

1268
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:13,880
life of so many people it structures life it structures their behaviors activities on a

1269
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:19,000
regular basis the way they see themselves in this world interacting with others where you

1270
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,640
come from where you go and you die all these big questions are answered by that if you have

1271
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:30,360
something come out that indicates that much of what you believe grew out of these very tangible

1272
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:36,280
things that existed in the past and potentially came from the future how is that going to force

1273
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:42,120
you to reshape your conceptualization of reality for a lot of people won't matter because religion

1274
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:46,760
is a belief that's all it is right doesn't matter you can say yeah your your religion everything

1275
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:51,560
you believe in jesus was a time traveler he was paranormal because he had the ability to do these

1276
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:56,760
things technologically and consciously and spiritually well it won't matter because faith

1277
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:02,200
is faith it'll bend but it won't break however with a lot of people especially the younger

1278
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:09,720
generations that have more open minds to science and different explanations for things it it may

1279
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:16,520
eliminate a lot of those world views that over time will eliminate the entire religion

1280
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:23,000
simply because those that ardently adhere to it die out and we we see this all the time it's a

1281
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:30,520
very normal process but it might be a line in the sand that helps reshape the way we have

1282
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:38,520
historically looked at our place in the universe in a spiritual capacity yeah did they did any of the

1283
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:42,920
guys who experienced these things ever see any like crosses on the spaceships or inside the

1284
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:48,520
spaceships or any like pictures of jesus not that i'm aware of no um that would be interesting

1285
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:53,400
though if there were different factions do you think the ones that created jesus yeah were like

1286
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:59,160
real big into like their their achievements and what they did do you think that the human timeline

1287
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:05,160
has been linear as far as evolution goes or do you think it's potential potential that there was a

1288
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:10,680
more advanced human civilization that got wiped out by a cataclysm no there's there's no evidence

1289
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:16,760
for that um and it just it wouldn't make sense in the fossil record it wouldn't make sense with the

1290
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:23,800
process of evolutionary change you go back six million years into the past to our earliest

1291
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:32,600
ancestors they were just starting to stand up right they didn't have any of the same traits we

1292
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:38,040
had and wouldn't for another four million years just nothing really happened in that period what

1293
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:43,880
we were mostly doing was adapting to becoming bipedal we stood upright around the time of

1294
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:49,480
lucy three and a half million years ago australopithecus afarensis we see her pelvic morphology

1295
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:54,680
looks pretty modern the head still looks like a chimpanzee and it would be like that all the way

1296
01:58:54,680 --> 01:59:00,520
up until about 800 000 years ago when really our brains started taking off our faces started

1297
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:04,760
shrinking back the fire the biocultural evolution the tools like i was talking about earlier

1298
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:13,000
so if there was any sort of chance that that could happen it would have to be within that window

1299
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:19,640
800 000 years to present but it's still one line you know and people talk about well what if there

1300
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:23,960
was like the salarian hypothesis what if there was some advanced civilization they were wiped out

1301
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:27,800
where would they have come from we were the only ones that can even talk about this stuff we're

1302
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:32,440
the only ones that would have done that and we didn't even have the capacity to until the last

1303
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:38,760
100 or 200 years it's happening a lot faster but it's all very recent there's no physiological

1304
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:43,000
evidence in the hominin lineage and more importantly there's no archaeological evidence

1305
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:48,520
that anything ever existed that would suggest a civilization had that capability and look at

1306
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:53,720
what we do look at how successful we are we exist on every part of this planet we erect these massive

1307
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:59,480
structures skyscrapers these monuments once you have civilization you get those you get public

1308
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:06,120
works projects you get these features as we call them those would appear and be highly prolific

1309
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:11,400
throughout the world with any advanced civilization because we don't see those there's no indication

1310
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:16,200
that they ever existed or there's a population that could ever leave earth in our hominin past

1311
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:22,200
up until the 1860s what about the evidence that has been i think i've had a few people talking

1312
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:28,040
about this recently on the podcast but there's been there was newspaper articles that were coming

1313
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:37,800
out in like the i want to say it was like the late 1800s early 1900s of giants that were discovered

1314
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:43,800
that were dug up in like new mexico area and there is actually i think this wasn't like the new york

1315
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:52,520
times steve can you pull up the newspaper articles of giant skeletons the stuff that

1316
02:00:52,520 --> 02:01:00,600
peregrine was talking about yeah like click on any one of these like giant skeletons 10 to 12

1317
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:06,120
feet tall found in mexican caves mexico city june does say the year this was there is a better one

1318
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:13,000
indians are rising out of the ledge strange skeletons found and that's so zoom in on that

1319
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,800
it says it says new york times and it says like the april 5th what what's the date punch in punch

1320
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:27,640
in punch in uh god son of a bitch what does that say uh 1886 1886 okay seven foot eight eight's

1321
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:34,680
pretty big they declared they have found bones of giant 32 feet bones of giant 32 feet high in

1322
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:41,560
mexico city mexico city yeah i mean there's just like like we don't we according to this there are

1323
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:46,360
evidence of like giants that you know maybe could explain building the pyramids but were they were

1324
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:52,840
they intelligent enough and like like how would people four or five thousand years ago be able to

1325
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:56,360
create some of the things like that we do have evidence for like these i don't know if you've

1326
02:01:56,360 --> 02:02:00,440
ever seen these but these there's these dynastic egyptian vases these are made of like this is a

1327
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:05,960
3d print of one but i had a guy who come in who brought in like 40 of them and they're made of

1328
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:13,400
granite and they brought them into a um an aerospace the aerospace division of rolls

1329
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:18,280
royce i believe where they have these light scanner scanning machines where they can essentially

1330
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:23,320
like measure them down to like the one one millionth of a centimeter and they found out

1331
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:32,600
that they are perfectly symmetrical within one uh like the variation of the width of a human hair

1332
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:37,240
and they're made out of the one of the hardest stones on earth and these hands like not only

1333
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:42,680
that but these handles are built into them and today if we wanted to recreate that it would have

1334
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:49,560
to be created on like a cnc machine like a very advanced computer uh modeling machine

1335
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:56,520
and the hundreds of and thousands of these have been found and there's no explanation like it's

1336
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:02,200
absolutely impossible for this to be done with um chisels you know copper chisels and pounding

1337
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:10,440
stones is there a date associated with them what is the date i think it was 2000 2400 bc

1338
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:16,680
yeah it's hard like i i went on ancient aliens a few times reluctantly at first did you really yeah

1339
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:21,560
yeah i've been on five different episodes maybe three different shoots but it was i was reluctant

1340
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:28,040
because they're sort of your your quintessential aliens built everything and and we really pull

1341
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:34,440
back from that as anthropologists because it's also innately racist because it's never european

1342
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:40,520
sites that we say that about we assume the europeans at that time could build those things but well the

1343
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:46,360
these browner people must have had help in egypt or you know central america or wherever but even

1344
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:51,800
beyond that we do have a good sense of how they would make these things and once you relieve

1345
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:57,160
people of the burdens of agriculture because the agricultural surplus allows people to do things

1346
02:03:57,160 --> 02:04:01,160
that doesn't mean they have to toil in the field all day then they have the ability to spend their

1347
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:05,640
day doing whatever it is if you're enslaving thousands of people because your agricultural

1348
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:11,160
society was able to take over theirs and force them into slavery you can use those people to do

1349
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:15,560
the manual labor to build these things so right we can understand how they did it we don't need to

1350
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:19,960
alien the gaps the same way we got the gaps with everything else et in the gaps we don't have to

1351
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:24,360
do that because we can see how they did it and understand these massive public works projects

1352
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:29,480
as being a latent effect of agriculture that's what i'm saying like it like wouldn't it be

1353
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:37,960
possible that instead of dating the creation of these and the pyramids to 4000 bc wouldn't it be

1354
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:44,760
more reasonable than claiming it aliens saying that maybe it was like advanced humans before

1355
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:49,800
some sort of cataclysm that maybe like wiped him wiped him out and and had to force us to reset

1356
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:53,160
no that that's something i can get on board with in fact i made that argument

1357
02:04:53,160 --> 02:05:00,120
at a lecture i gave in phoenix last may uh may and a half it's a weird way of saying that the

1358
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:04,200
the may before this one the previous may i don't know what i'm giving you seven different versions

1359
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:10,920
of which may this was that makes no uh it's not relevant maybe we could edit that part out too

1360
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:18,040
too in any case i i i looked at this in the context of kind of what we're talking about the

1361
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:23,480
solarian hypothesis that there are out of place artifacts that seemingly indicate that this thing

1362
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:27,880
was produced by a more advanced species than was alive at that time not that they built the

1363
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:33,800
pyramids or anything but what i argued is that you could have the same line of evolution in our

1364
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:40,280
technology from simple to complex where it goes on into the future and we start making things

1365
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:47,240
that if found in our past would confuse the hell out of us but that would only happen with backward

1366
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:53,400
time travel technology so it's the same process of descent with modification we in culture we

1367
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:58,120
talk about how it's cumulative it's always built on what came before even our languages that we

1368
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:03,400
speak like that semantic uh drift thing yeah it's built on the evolution of language and we can look

1369
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:09,160
at what came before and how it changed same thing with technology we go from simple to complex and

1370
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:16,760
this evolution of compounding cultural complexity but with a backward time machine if you jump over

1371
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:21,880
now you take that more advanced technology and the artifacts that you produce and they exist in the

1372
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:28,520
past and even things like atlantis if you can imagine that we do nuke this planet or there's

1373
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:33,480
just it's inhospitable but we go on to exist in the future we have the ability to go back in the

1374
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:40,040
past and set up shop at a time that predates not not just that we could hide underwater we could

1375
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:45,640
hide in mountains or we could hide in plain sight if it's before 70 000 years ago because humans

1376
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:51,480
didn't invent boats until 70 000 years ago you could have this island all to yourself and know

1377
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:56,120
nobody's going to find it because they don't have the technology to do so so i think that could even

1378
02:06:56,120 --> 02:07:01,720
help explain like these ideas of atlantis these lost civilizations it wasn't some offshoot

1379
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:06,760
but it was potentially humans from the future and this is a reoccurring theme in the revelation book

1380
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:12,120
too humans from the future that have the option to live in whatever pristine garden of eden they

1381
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:17,880
would like on this planet yes in a place prior to humans having the ability to discover it at that

1382
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:22,600
time right like right now they could live in an ark if they wanted to yeah i mean we're there we

1383
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:26,520
check it out occasionally but there's so much left and yeah maybe they're doing it in our time and

1384
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:30,680
and maybe these usos the underwater bases yeah these crypto terrestrials that we've explored

1385
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:34,840
more of the moon than we have of our own oceans so they could our side of the moon would be a good

1386
02:07:34,840 --> 02:07:40,040
opportunity too up until the 1960s when we started going there so it's kind of the same thing as i

1387
02:07:40,040 --> 02:07:45,960
was saying 70 000 years ago before boats moon would have been a perfect option up until the

1388
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:50,600
late 1960s and even then it's really weird what happened with the moon like us and the russians

1389
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:55,160
are working together which is weird unto itself during the cold war no back in the 60s like they

1390
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:59,560
had their missions we had our missions and there were these ideas about populating it we're going

1391
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:03,880
to go there and make these bases and all of a sudden we're like no we don't want to go there

1392
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:10,520
anymore why is that you know what what's happening on the moon and the far side of the moon especially

1393
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:15,960
that could be such a great place to build a base if you were extraterrestrial you know the future

1394
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:21,720
humans whatever nobody's going to find you there and even if they do it's a select group of

1395
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:26,200
individuals who you could convince to just pr campaign the hell out of that so nobody wants

1396
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:30,200
to talk about anymore because that's exactly what happened all of a sudden they reversed

1397
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:35,960
the direction and nobody's talking about these moon bases anymore populating the moon it was

1398
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:41,960
like do you think we really went to the moon yeah i do yeah yeah we definitely went to the moon it's

1399
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:46,200
just what did they find up there yes that's what that's what piques my interest and then you look

1400
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:52,040
at ingo swan his penetration book he remote viewed it case after case of other abductees i read one

1401
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:56,600
called like abducted in the latin quarter by this woman that just sent me this book about her

1402
02:08:56,600 --> 02:09:02,360
abduction experience she was standing on in this base crater in the moon with this woman who was

1403
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:08,920
telepathically communicating with her looking down at this base terry lovelace claims to have seen

1404
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:13,880
this this guy named jerry wills was taken up to this moon base and shown it and then brought back

1405
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:18,440
he's like what's the point of that i just want to show you that there is a you see enough of these

1406
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:24,840
you start to ask questions there was a guy who i had on the show who said that he was contacted

1407
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:29,320
and visited by a guy who worked for nasa for like decades and he claimed to be like the expert in

1408
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:33,080
mapping the moon for the moon missions the guy was really old i think i forget his name

1409
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:42,120
i can't think of his name right now but he he wrote a couple books about the moon

1410
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:46,360
but his job essentially was to basically like map out where they were going to go

1411
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:50,520
during those missions during the apollo missions and like how to navigate it seems important you

1412
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:56,840
don't want to crash into a rock somewhere crater right and he allegedly told this guy chris bledsoe

1413
02:09:56,840 --> 02:10:04,200
was on my podcast that there was ancient structures on the moon like like mushroom shaped structures

1414
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:10,440
that were ancient and he's claimed to know like i think there's so many weird interesting theories

1415
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:17,320
about the moon you know it's crazy apparently like the moon our moon is like the one moon

1416
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:22,920
that is perfectly placed perfectly shaped to keep us in like the perfect gravitational balance to

1417
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:27,080
maintain life and apparently that's the only moon that exists that we know of that's that perfect

1418
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:34,440
yeah what it does for our tides itself and and taking a lot of the the brunt of the asteroid

1419
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:40,120
yeah and it's i've heard it's cheese also yeah delicious cheese well i have heard that it's

1420
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:45,960
honeycombed on the inside too um there's the hollow moon theory well yeah hollow moon honeycomb

1421
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:50,040
honeycomb it could be the same but there was actually like a nasa thing that came out recently

1422
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:53,880
which i think i've talked about in like fucking 10 podcasts already in the last month

1423
02:10:54,680 --> 02:11:00,680
that said that they found uh deep caves on the man for that yeah i heard that too and there's

1424
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:05,080
water we're always told there's no atmosphere there's no water as a a fleeting atmosphere

1425
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:11,160
that will form and deform and yeah i was watching on on stephen colbert one night the the group of

1426
02:11:11,160 --> 02:11:15,960
people i forget what they're calling the mission but they're they're gonna go to the moon and

1427
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:20,040
they're gonna use this jumping off point to go to the mars and they're getting water and it's like

1428
02:11:20,040 --> 02:11:24,760
well they told us for so long there's no water on the moon there's no atmosphere it's just this dead

1429
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:30,600
nothingness right i don't know like i'm not big into conspiracy theories but other than the cheese

1430
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:39,000
moon thing uh i'm i'm kind of starting to ask some questions but there's a what so is that a

1431
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,040
real photo right there no i know the one in the middle is definitely not real but the one on the

1432
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:47,880
right and the left or is that a real lava tube on the moon says lunar lava tube wikipedia lunar

1433
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:53,080
lava tube um apparently that's what it is click on the actual link so we can see the wikipedia

1434
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:58,840
lunar lunar lava tubes are lava tubes on the moon formed during the eruption of uh basaltic lava

1435
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:05,240
flows when the surface of a lava flow cools oh so there was lava on the moon yeah it's interesting

1436
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:12,280
something that small could have tectonic activity and a hundred meters deep lava a hundred meters

1437
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:16,280
deep that's what this one is a hundred meters jesus christ

1438
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:23,080
yeah i don't know a lot of questions i did bet some kid at a party one time

1439
02:12:23,160 --> 02:12:29,080
that within we bet 20 bucks had some uh some people notarize it who are watching our insane

1440
02:12:29,080 --> 02:12:35,480
conversation um a normie you know not into the ufo stuff at all but i i bet him 20 bucks that

1441
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:43,240
within 10 years we would have we would know as a society that there is and has been a moon on the

1442
02:12:43,240 --> 02:12:47,960
base that's how convinced i am a base on the moon far side far side of the moon yeah yeah i think

1443
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:54,200
that's likely i think so too uh i also added an addendum for another 20 dollars that it's the

1444
02:12:54,200 --> 02:13:00,120
air force they're involved somehow yeah it has to be air sport or air force or um space force

1445
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:06,520
nr o what's that one um the national reconnaissance office there's like we think of like the three

1446
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:12,920
letter agents funny like anna jameson pointed this out there's like 18 or 20 three letter agencies

1447
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:16,680
intelligence agencies that we don't even fucking know about speaking of shit that scared the the

1448
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:22,840
hell out of you that interview scared the hell out of me which one with uh jacobson annie yeah

1449
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:28,520
yeah oh yeah that was intense yeah especially in the context of all the stuff we've been talking

1450
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:35,320
about with the warnings that experiencers have with like yeah no it's all about i took some

1451
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:41,880
preventative action uh after listening to that one for sure it's uh did you buy a bunker no i

1452
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:47,320
didn't buy a bunker i can't afford a bunker look at me weird cheap clothes um no billionaires

1453
02:13:47,320 --> 02:13:51,880
dressed just like you what are you talking about i don't know about that although the hoodie was

1454
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:55,560
in fashion for a while i've been rocking that one my whole life so it was cool to see the billionaires

1455
02:13:55,560 --> 02:14:01,880
wearing um no just yeah you know like i live i live in a place that's already pretty well

1456
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:10,120
suited yes yes you do i feel very fortunate about that um natural spring and the yard animals

1457
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:14,440
everywhere yes no just just you live in a great place for an apocalypse bring it on and a civil

1458
02:14:14,440 --> 02:14:19,560
war you actually look at living a great place for a civil war too yeah no i but i don't want that

1459
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:25,240
for anyone it's it it scares me not necessarily for myself but just what we would all have to

1460
02:14:25,240 --> 02:14:30,520
suffer through and and honestly as as destructive as this life is and you multiply it out over the

1461
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:35,400
billions of people on this planet it's relatively comfortable for most people you know you don't

1462
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:39,800
have to worry about walking outside and getting shot by a sniper up on a hill who's hoping to

1463
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:45,240
get whatever little rations you have we we want our children to grow up with the same luxuries

1464
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:49,960
and amenities that we had and grew accustomed to and we don't want people to die like if people

1465
02:14:49,960 --> 02:14:55,240
started dying by the millions i think it would just do a lot to our collective psyche as humans

1466
02:14:55,880 --> 02:15:00,440
especially empathetic people it would just it would be horrible you know and if if there is

1467
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:07,320
something coming and if we do emerge on the other side better a more benevolent empathetic highly

1468
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:11,560
conscious species great but it would still suck to live through that you know yeah

1469
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:19,720
yeah it totally would um do you think if these things were future time travelers do you think

1470
02:15:19,720 --> 02:15:24,920
they would if there was like a a nuclear war about to happen or if like kim jong-un was about to

1471
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:29,400
launch a nuke they would come stop it yeah so where they let it happen we kind of danced around

1472
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:35,400
this earlier um when you were like why would they care you know if they're extraterrestrials why

1473
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:40,200
would they care yes just leave them alone yes you know dance around with their nukes and blow

1474
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:45,960
each other up um and and actually you know jalen heinick's one of jalen heinick's son paul heinick

1475
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:50,760
um i heard him say this a few times like what how would they find us and why would they care

1476
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:55,080
those are two big questions we have to ask if they're extraterrestrial how would they find us

1477
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:59,400
i talk about that a lot in my first book just the difficulties of not just finding us locating

1478
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:04,120
us but then communicating with us too it'd be much easier to learn the languages of the past

1479
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:09,400
than it would have a planet that exists elsewhere and you're relying on radio transmissions which

1480
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:13,080
are governed by the speed of light would take you know potentially light years to reach you

1481
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:17,800
how would they find us why would they care but if they are stakeholders in the future

1482
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:23,640
to your point earlier why would they care um it's their planet of course they would care because

1483
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:28,440
they have to live on i mean my editor made me take this out of my second book but i think it's

1484
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:34,280
an apt analogy where it's like you're at a four day music festival it's day four they're not

1485
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:39,960
keeping up with the porta potties and you're the last guy in line that's them looking at us right

1486
02:16:39,960 --> 02:16:47,080
now we are all the drunk people who have been eating bean burritos the entire festival drinking

1487
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:52,280
bush light and about to destroy that bathroom you know and they see themselves at the end of

1488
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:56,040
that line looking at us like oh it's gonna be a mess in there you know i might as well just go

1489
02:16:56,040 --> 02:17:01,800
off into the woods or kill them all and then take the bathroom before they destroy it or let them

1490
02:17:01,800 --> 02:17:07,800
kill themselves and then take the bathroom after they destroy it or some other solution that does

1491
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:14,280
involve everybody dying i don't know i also don't know if they can save us if we did do that they

1492
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:19,160
certainly can't change the past if we're in a block universe i i got into this in chapter 13

1493
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:24,120
or case study 13 of my second book maybe you remember kind of going back and forth between

1494
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:28,280
tempestrials the second book yeah okay going back and forth between the black universe

1495
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:34,840
and the many worlds interpretation in the context of this very question the nukes getting launched

1496
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:40,120
what they did at malmstrom i was on a conference call with a number of people but robert sallis

1497
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:46,440
was one of them talking to our senator john testers aides about the importance of this ufo

1498
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:51,800
question particularly because of what they did at malmstrom and robert sallis was there he was

1499
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:56,520
is that where they had like an icbm or something like that 10 of them okay go offline and started

1500
02:17:56,520 --> 02:18:00,760
with one that's near you right where yeah yeah yeah i gave a talk at lewiston just outside of

1501
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:05,080
malmstrom and it was like there's so many people there and they're so interested because they were

1502
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:10,840
directly affected by they've they've been touched by the phenomenon so they they know it's real

1503
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:15,720
more than a lot of people but what they did is they shut down they took offline one of these icbms

1504
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:23,560
deactivated it while this i think he said it was red like a red glowing sphere is outside all of

1505
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:29,000
a sudden boom boom boom the other nine go offline yeah so they clearly were doing that for a reason

1506
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:36,520
was it to send a message to us was it to demonstrate that they could either for us or them so it might

1507
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:41,320
the only way i could see this playing out where they would the scenario specifically is if they

1508
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:47,160
were to stop something is if they did it as a preventative thing i think if it happens it

1509
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:51,480
happens they can't come back and change it but if they saw us getting ready to launch

1510
02:18:52,680 --> 02:18:56,920
they might be able to intervene and they've demonstrated at malmstrom and we have changed

1511
02:18:56,920 --> 02:19:02,440
our protocols another friend of mine um im butte he worked at malmstrom to make everything analog

1512
02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:07,880
because they thought if this happened again and nothing was digital then they wouldn't be able

1513
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:13,240
to do it which i think is interesting because they're nothing was digital yeah so his job was

1514
02:19:13,240 --> 02:19:17,880
to rewire everything oh they wouldn't be able to control it yeah so that they couldn't do what

1515
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:23,560
whatever it was that they did um at malmstrom initially so i don't know i think and if you

1516
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:29,880
think about that in a time a linear uh time travel like cause and effect if they would do it that

1517
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:36,040
would cause us to make everything analog so we could launch a new yeah like again in the block

1518
02:19:36,040 --> 02:19:41,160
universe and would they know that would they not know that i don't know there's so many questions

1519
02:19:41,160 --> 02:19:46,440
that arise and i didn't give an answer in that case study where i just here's what this would look

1520
02:19:46,440 --> 02:19:51,160
like in the block universe here's what it would look like in the multiverse with branching

1521
02:19:51,160 --> 02:19:58,440
timelines both are fundamentally different this last book revelation i also do that again um but

1522
02:19:58,440 --> 02:20:05,160
in the context of this story that's a i call it peri-apocalyptic it's not pre-apocalyptic it's

1523
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:09,960
not post it's both but it's happening mostly at this time where they've got to decide are they

1524
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:15,640
intervening are they not intervening and what does that mean for both us and them since they are set

1525
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:20,280
to inherit that earth that we may or may not destroy and i can't say what happens because it's

1526
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:26,360
kind of yeah the big plot twist yeah i mean one of the things that annie describes in her nuclear

1527
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:30,040
war book which i don't think anybody knows unless they've read the book was how fragile

1528
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:34,680
that the nuclear protocol is yeah that was surprising wasn't it yeah because we have all

1529
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:39,880
those nr o satellites and and all the planes and submarines that are all that are tracking

1530
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:43,560
everything around the whole entire world like three minutes or something like if one goes up

1531
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:47,960
there's three minutes to decide what you're gonna do yep and i think it's six minutes until the

1532
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:51,720
thing will hit if it launched in north korea i think it's like six minutes until it actually

1533
02:20:51,720 --> 02:20:57,320
hit or no it was like 12 minutes until it hits us yeah but it's like three minutes to actually

1534
02:20:57,320 --> 02:21:03,720
make the decision on what to do that was the scary part yeah and it's like i mean even the concept of

1535
02:21:03,720 --> 02:21:10,920
mutual annihilation is just like really yeah the problem to worry about the problem is though if a

1536
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:20,520
if a rocket if an icbm launches they we have to immediately empty our nuclear silos the icbm

1537
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:24,120
silos that we have in the midwest because we have to assume that they're going to target those which

1538
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:30,680
are going to basically castrate us from having a return attack so those have to go up and then

1539
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:34,280
they have to fly over russia and all these other countries that don't know we can't get on the

1540
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:42,600
phone quick enough so it's almost like an inevitable apocalypse if even one rocket launches yeah it

1541
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:50,680
feels very fragile considering what we're dealing with it's yeah that's the scariest part um you

1542
02:21:50,680 --> 02:21:54,840
described that you were at some conference and something happened to you you had some sort of

1543
02:21:54,840 --> 02:21:59,800
like crazy experience yeah it's been a lot of crazy experiences lately because when you started

1544
02:21:59,800 --> 02:22:06,520
writing about this you had never had any kind of like never even seen a ufo no not at all actually

1545
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:13,480
well other than when i walked into my living room at age eight or nine and saw um that book actually

1546
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:17,640
it's funny you know when the communion book yeah when you and eric were talking eric wargo

1547
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:23,560
you described you guys were talking about uh precognition how a lot of people create things

1548
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:27,720
or do things because they feel compelled to do it but a lot of that might be their information

1549
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:32,440
coming from the future right and you described a situation that was almost exactly my life

1550
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:37,400
where it's like well so you know you might do something and then there's that information's

1551
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:41,480
traveling back and so as a child like you're compelled to do these things and that that's

1552
02:22:41,480 --> 02:22:46,840
what i feel happened to me when i was eight or nine years old and i walked in because it wasn't just

1553
02:22:46,840 --> 02:22:52,440
those images that popped in my head it came with something that i've since experienced about three

1554
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:59,880
or four times that was sort of like a a light you know and like a i hate the word download but

1555
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:08,120
i don't know what else to use there was information that came with that that in retrospect i

1556
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:15,400
i i framed it as precognition i eventually had to explain because i've had i've had dream

1557
02:23:15,400 --> 02:23:21,560
precognition my entire life and i had to find a way to figure out what that was because it was weird

1558
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:27,240
i knew people before i met them i knew what was going to happen in certain situations i knew my

1559
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:31,240
wife and my children before i met them the first time i saw my wife i was like wait who's that

1560
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:35,560
i knew her already we would go on to spend our lives together and make children together and buy

1561
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:41,160
houses together and and and that that's been a very common thing in my life but i've also had

1562
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:47,720
five moments of conscious precognition where and one of them ironically was about a week before i

1563
02:23:47,720 --> 02:23:52,680
was going down to be on a panel with eric wargo at the opening the archives of the impossible

1564
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:59,000
conference at rice university where my my wife was taking the kids the bus stop big snow storm

1565
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:03,320
missed the bus had to follow him to the next bus stop she goes to turn around in what looks like

1566
02:24:03,320 --> 02:24:09,000
a flat area but it was all drifted over by snow sinks the car straight down this massive ditch

1567
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:13,720
i didn't know any of this i pick up my phone i was like oh it's weird my wife hasn't called

1568
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:18,840
to pull me out of the ditch yet instantly the phone rings she's never gotten stuck in the snow

1569
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:23,480
she's never gotten stuck anywhere that i had to pull her out of but i knew before she called she

1570
02:24:23,480 --> 02:24:27,240
was calling me to do that i had to go to work too normally i probably would have been a little

1571
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:31,160
pissed like well i gotta go you know we spent like an hour trying to dig that thing out and pull it

1572
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:38,200
out with my truck but i was just like oh she hasn't called yet to go and then the phone rings telling

1573
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:43,160
me the thing that i just thought it's weird she hasn't called me to do um and that's happened

1574
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:48,680
four or five other times the thing as a kid i feel was a pre-cognitive moment it shaped my

1575
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:54,680
whole life to go on to do the things that we're talking about right now would that have happened

1576
02:24:54,680 --> 02:25:00,040
without that probably not so there's these connected moments in life the one uh behind

1577
02:25:00,040 --> 02:25:04,600
morton hall when i decided to switch from physics to biological anthropology it seems like there's

1578
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:09,480
these things and there's there's actually this cool study uh being done i encourage any of your

1579
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:14,520
listeners to reach out um i forget what's called like the destiny project or something like that

1580
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:22,600
it's it's sharon uh hewitt raulette who wrote she was one of the runners up for the bigelow prize

1581
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:26,440
oh if you were aware of the million dollars that was allocated to

1582
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:31,800
to give the best evidence i had a guy in here i think who won that jeffrey mishlove he's the

1583
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:35,880
one that won it no it was a different guy he said he won it there were there were there were three

1584
02:25:35,880 --> 02:25:40,600
no probably not there were three winners okay he was a near-death experience yeah yeah yeah a lot

1585
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:46,760
of it was a lot of it was based on ndes yeah um but yeah jeffrey mishlove won i think he got 500k

1586
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:51,480
and then there were other prizes too she's one of the people that wrote this i just had about an

1587
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:55,800
hour and a half long conversation with her last week because she's doing this project

1588
02:25:55,800 --> 02:26:02,200
looking at people who have seemingly had experiences in their life that shape their life or maybe

1589
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:07,080
lead them in one direction over another where they feel it wasn't necessarily

1590
02:26:07,640 --> 02:26:14,200
their ego or their individual choice in doing those things and i've had a ton of those throughout

1591
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:19,560
my life so i saw she was doing this i know her from she was actually at that um esalen conference

1592
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:24,440
in 2022 i just referenced so i got to know her there spent a lot of time on the phone we're

1593
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:29,480
hashing out all this insane shit that's been happening to me recently that has forced me to

1594
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:35,160
look back into my life and see other things that had also been weird that i didn't pay much

1595
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:44,440
attention to until i had the the 2020 hindsight vision where things started to make sense the

1596
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:49,320
dots were connected so to speak but it's only once a lot of this other weird stuff has been

1597
02:26:49,320 --> 02:26:57,880
happening but yeah i was at the international ufo congress in 2022 just gave my talk um took like a

1598
02:26:57,880 --> 02:27:02,760
two and a half hour nap missed the vip party where we're supposed to go and schmooze with people that

1599
02:27:03,480 --> 02:27:09,800
want to meet the speakers show up a half hour late groggy i'd like you know sorry never take naps i

1600
02:27:09,800 --> 02:27:16,360
don't know why i just slept so long and then yeah um things just sort of snowballed from there um

1601
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:23,000
it took me about a year to be able to talk about it at all and then um finally got up the courage

1602
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:29,720
to do so but um yeah i mean it's it's way too long to go into from start to finish but the

1603
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:37,320
the cliff notes version is that i was taken up into that same room where these um

1604
02:27:38,120 --> 02:27:43,880
where i was late because of the the inopportune nap and i was taken there i wasn't allowed to

1605
02:27:43,880 --> 02:27:50,840
leave these two people came in what room again uh it was that vip room that the the organizers

1606
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:56,520
oh booked that for as like a common space and that's where people met you know they had some

1607
02:27:56,520 --> 02:28:01,800
beers and stuff and people would go back there afterwards and you know like travis walt brings

1608
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:08,840
his guitar people jam out i was looking forward to do all of that didn't get to um but they uh took

1609
02:28:08,840 --> 02:28:16,440
me up there started by telling me something that i had only thought and never told anybody else

1610
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:21,560
who is that well i know who it is now i didn't have any idea who it was at the time was a total

1611
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:28,120
stranger uh but his name is eric mitchell and he he's also experienced some crazy stuff like ufo

1612
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:38,840
stuff and just a lot of sort of um classic experiencer things modifications to his his

1613
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:45,560
psyche his world view uh he's an experiencer you know we all kind of walk home yeah but at the time

1614
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:50,920
i had no idea who he was he was a random stranger that came in pulled up his chair to wear his knees

1615
02:28:50,920 --> 02:28:59,960
in my crotch like a very imposing sort of body position races right here and he tells me something

1616
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:06,520
that i had never told anyone a thought in my head which was very effective because i was like wait

1617
02:29:06,520 --> 02:29:12,680
what is happening why was i kept here so long who is this guy it wasn't him as it turns out in the

1618
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:19,560
strict sense of who an individual is with their own sense of ego the best i can explain it is

1619
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:27,240
um something called deep trans mediumship where he was him in his body but there was also um

1620
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:33,560
something else some other consciousness that had sort of pushed his to the side and was speaking

1621
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:38,120
through him initially vocally most of the conversation i'd say it was probably over

1622
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:42,600
a half hour period started out with verbal speech between him and the woman that brought me up there

1623
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:47,960
that was keeping me there and then over the course of the next 10 minutes it moved to entirely

1624
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:53,560
telepathic speech where it almost felt like it was happening above my head like the three of us are

1625
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:59,880
communicating oddly in our same voices same voices without coming through the vocal cords i can hear

1626
02:29:59,880 --> 02:30:04,920
heidi and eric's voice in my head i can hear my own voice when i speak without moving our mouths

1627
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:08,360
none of us were moving our mouths it's still to this day one of the weirdest things about that

1628
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:15,000
um and yeah it's just that and then a number of other things they they told me they asked me

1629
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:20,040
i was allowed to ask them questions about things and then they got to the main point the main point

1630
02:30:20,040 --> 02:30:23,720
was to ask me not to stop doing what i was doing because i was getting really sick of it

1631
02:30:25,080 --> 02:30:31,560
and it is taxing you know the travel and just talking to people constantly about these things

1632
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:35,560
that fortunately i love talking about you know i say i've always been easily bored by the banality

1633
02:30:35,560 --> 02:30:40,200
of reality and that is very true like these conversations we're having are my favorite to

1634
02:30:40,200 --> 02:30:47,400
have i get really sick talking about boring shit with that said ufo fatigue is real yeah big time

1635
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:53,320
big time you know i'm experiencing it too yeah and and it's yeah it was hard it was an especially

1636
02:30:53,320 --> 02:30:59,240
hard period and i was just done i wanted to quit and and i didn't tell anybody that they asked me

1637
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:03,720
not to quit how could you know that that's insane and then there were a number of other things that

1638
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:08,360
happened throughout this question answer session people are starting to come into the room

1639
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:15,320
people see us out there and are worried about me as i found out later uh some of them knew me

1640
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:20,920
and at one point three women came out and this individual eric in a vocal speech at this point

1641
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:24,920
we were speaking telepathically which is probably why they came out like why are these three people

1642
02:31:24,920 --> 02:31:29,720
just sitting there without moving their mouths i couldn't even move my head by this point but he

1643
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:34,520
said something like can you close the door behind you out loud and it kind of broke from the

1644
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:39,800
telepathic thing that was happening so it jumped out at me kind of like and then all three of them

1645
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:44,600
turned walked back inside and closed the door behind them and that was all that was said nobody

1646
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:50,440
came out the rest of the time by the time they released me there's probably 20 people inside

1647
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:55,320
i would guess i'd walk through a crowd of people to get out of there but what happened between them

1648
02:31:55,960 --> 02:32:00,200
is that they said they had to put three things in my brain that would be important for some future

1649
02:32:00,200 --> 02:32:04,920
time or times uh they told me what would happen my eyes would go black even though they'd be

1650
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:10,120
wide open and the information would come in i wouldn't have access to it they told me i wouldn't

1651
02:32:10,120 --> 02:32:16,440
know what it was but very politely asked if that's okay they asked for my permission for this to

1652
02:32:16,440 --> 02:32:26,520
happen after everything else that had occurred it was clear to me that that they were um i don't

1653
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:29,880
know what they are i don't know who they are i don't know what they are a highly advanced

1654
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:35,000
non-local consciousness is the best i can do but i did get the sense that they were familiar

1655
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:44,680
that i had known them my entire life and then it sort of made me start to think more recently

1656
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:49,960
was that thing that happened when i was eight or nine with witley's book cover and the download

1657
02:32:49,960 --> 02:32:55,960
for lack of a better word was that my precognition or was it them they were putting things in my

1658
02:32:55,960 --> 02:33:01,400
brain at that moment could they have also done that when i was eight or nine years old you know

1659
02:33:01,400 --> 02:33:05,160
and then other moments too and a lot of these came up when i was talking to sharon for this

1660
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:09,800
destiny project i apologize if i'm getting that name wrong because there's i started to think

1661
02:33:09,800 --> 02:33:17,080
back like wait now that i have this lived experience this sense of what happened and

1662
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:22,280
sorry i'm jumping all over the place but it's hard to describe all of this as one straightforward

1663
02:33:22,280 --> 02:33:27,000
narrative but what they eventually did is exactly what they said my eyes went black i'm still

1664
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:31,880
staring right at this individual's faces right here and all this information comes streaming

1665
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:37,640
into my brain at tremendous speed i was able to see it temporarily in that moment because heidi

1666
02:33:37,640 --> 02:33:41,640
who's standing to my right with her hand now on my shoulder would say did you get that did

1667
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:48,520
you get that i would just kind of mumble uh-huh uh-huh so i i could clearly see it briefly as

1668
02:33:48,520 --> 02:33:54,120
it crossed the threshold but then it completely disappeared it went into my brain i have no idea

1669
02:33:54,120 --> 02:34:01,080
what it was no no access to it well how can they be memories if it's a future memory that i will

1670
02:34:01,080 --> 02:34:06,600
have you know it clearly time and memories don't work the way we consider them because i have had

1671
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:13,880
dream precognition my entire life as i mentioned but those future events are in my brain for some

1672
02:34:13,880 --> 02:34:18,280
thing that i guess is going to happen but i have no idea what it is or when it's going to happen

1673
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:23,640
or what specifically are the events associated with it but they politely asked me if they could

1674
02:34:23,640 --> 02:34:29,560
put it in i agreed but it did force me to look back over other things that have occurred in my life

1675
02:34:30,520 --> 02:34:35,720
with a new conceptualization of what those things might have been

1676
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:39,000
and how they might be tied into all of this other shit

1677
02:34:43,480 --> 02:34:48,200
but i don't know i don't know what the hell it is it really sure did you ever have a conversation

1678
02:34:48,200 --> 02:34:55,320
with eric yeah yeah heidi after this yeah so heidi i did know before because i met her in 2019 at

1679
02:34:55,320 --> 02:35:02,120
that same conference she was running audio video and we kind of chatted and gave her daughter a

1680
02:35:02,120 --> 02:35:11,960
sticker so so she was able to get me up there because i knew her eric was a complete stranger

1681
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:16,760
in fact eric and heidi prior to this had never been in the same room they kind of knew each other

1682
02:35:16,760 --> 02:35:21,720
but they'd never met face to face they were both brought here for this thing they were brought to

1683
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:29,240
the balcony of that room for this thing her mind i think was probably taken over before his like

1684
02:35:29,240 --> 02:35:34,840
when we were downstairs and she took me up i think they saw an opportunity and brought me up there i

1685
02:35:34,840 --> 02:35:39,080
was actually pissed i was like we went up there just to get beers to take down to some of our

1686
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:45,960
friends because she had access to this room and the organizers don't care and um yeah she was

1687
02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:50,280
she brought me up there and then wouldn't let me leave i've got beers in my pockets we're ready to

1688
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:55,000
go back down you know our friends are waiting for us and she's like oh we can't leave i'm like why

1689
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,920
eric's coming he wants to talk to you i'm like who the hell is eric oh he's a friend of mine don't

1690
02:35:58,920 --> 02:36:04,600
worry about it she must have said that 10 12 times and i'm just getting irritated you know

1691
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:11,640
so i knew heidi but i was so scared about what happened even a year after that i didn't i didn't

1692
02:36:11,640 --> 02:36:17,800
want to talk to her because i didn't know what she was or what we were or what reality is anymore

1693
02:36:17,800 --> 02:36:23,240
so i i spent a year trying to avoid all of this eventually i got the sense that i was supposed to

1694
02:36:23,240 --> 02:36:26,840
talk to it and that's one of the things they told me in this conversation i was allowed to ask

1695
02:36:26,840 --> 02:36:31,480
questions like my third question was can i talk about this and i said we want you to talk about

1696
02:36:31,480 --> 02:36:37,160
this so between that and feeling like a goddamn hypocrite because i dedicated my second book that

1697
02:36:37,160 --> 02:36:42,280
you just read to all of the brave people that are willing to talk about their experiences recognizing

1698
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:47,160
i wasn't one of those brave people you know i should be talking about this they asked me to

1699
02:36:47,160 --> 02:36:53,000
but i was scared i was really scared to talk about something that a i don't understand how

1700
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:57,240
do you talk about something you don't know about b because i don't know what they put in my brain

1701
02:36:57,240 --> 02:37:02,200
and that's obviously what people want to know more than anything else is what's in there i don't know

1702
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:09,560
and c because i had no sense of like what reality was anymore like the things that happened in that

1703
02:37:09,560 --> 02:37:16,520
moment really kind of forced me to reconceptualize physical reality and consciousness and

1704
02:37:16,520 --> 02:37:22,840
just spirit souls energy like all of these things i'd always been a strict materialist

1705
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:30,040
and now i i've kind of been flipped as cripple says you know i had to flip and start thinking

1706
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:36,920
about these things that were never on my radar um but to your question yeah so i i talked about

1707
02:37:36,920 --> 02:37:42,440
jesse michaels first and and kind of had a little breakdown the day before i was flying down to la

1708
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:45,480
to speak with him because i knew he would want to talk about it he was one of the first people i

1709
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:50,840
told because i was down in la with him in december which was only about a month and a half after it

1710
02:37:50,840 --> 02:37:55,640
happened and it kind of came up because it was i was still losing my shit over it and really jacked

1711
02:37:55,640 --> 02:38:01,000
me up for about a month recently after that it was very recent after it happened and we wrapped on

1712
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:06,120
this shoot and then it kind of just came up organically and the floodgates opened the guy

1713
02:38:06,280 --> 02:38:11,240
just i hadn't really talked to anybody about it other than my wife and my kids who had overheard

1714
02:38:11,240 --> 02:38:17,880
us talking about it but i knew he knew and would want to talk about it as i was preparing to go

1715
02:38:17,880 --> 02:38:23,400
down to finish you know the shoot we did in two different segments and i just didn't know if i

1716
02:38:23,400 --> 02:38:28,360
could and then recognized i was being a hypocrite by thanking other people for their bravery and me

1717
02:38:28,360 --> 02:38:35,640
being just a little wuss and um so i reached out to heidi like hey do you remember when they said

1718
02:38:36,200 --> 02:38:42,520
we want you to talk about this did you get any sense of the time frame and she this made it

1719
02:38:42,520 --> 02:38:48,840
even more confusing she was there she remembered being there and all of the weird things that

1720
02:38:48,840 --> 02:38:54,280
happened but she wasn't allowed to remember the specific things that were said i eventually

1721
02:38:54,280 --> 02:39:00,040
learned eric so so basically with deep trans mediumship the deep one your consciousness

1722
02:39:00,040 --> 02:39:05,800
is completely pushed aside so you look at people like um you know the bashar guy or like

1723
02:39:06,360 --> 02:39:12,680
uh what's her name norah roberts um mediums essentially people that can channel

1724
02:39:14,200 --> 02:39:18,200
there's different levels of that so hers was completely pushed aside she was there she was

1725
02:39:18,200 --> 02:39:24,840
participating as a physical form but her mind was completely taken over essentially eric on the other

1726
02:39:24,840 --> 02:39:31,640
hand had some awareness of what was being said through him not all of it but he has memories of

1727
02:39:31,640 --> 02:39:37,800
certain things that were spoken i didn't know that i just assumed she was some kind of crazy

1728
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:41,960
creature of some sort that could do this shit on her own you know i didn't know

1729
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:49,080
but i was afraid to ask until then because i was going down to potentially talk about this for the

1730
02:39:49,080 --> 02:39:54,280
first time and she's like i i don't know i don't i don't remember anything that was said or the

1731
02:39:54,280 --> 02:39:58,040
conversation that was had and i was but she remembered being there oh yeah not why she was

1732
02:39:58,040 --> 02:40:05,160
there yeah yeah exactly and in the next day she was like eric's an interesting guy huh and i

1733
02:40:05,160 --> 02:40:10,280
couldn't even deal like i was losing my mind i was like uh-huh uh-huh yeah pretty pretty strange i'm

1734
02:40:10,280 --> 02:40:15,240
packing up all my stuff to get out of there and she's she's one i realize now she was wanting to

1735
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:19,160
know more about what happened and thought i would know and i did because i was conscious throughout

1736
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:25,160
90 of it but i didn't know that's why she was asking i thought she was just kind of like yeah

1737
02:40:25,160 --> 02:40:30,440
weird stuff last night and i i wasn't ready to deal at that point it took me a year before i was

1738
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:35,240
even ready to reach out like hey i might have to talk about this did you get a sense of when

1739
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:41,400
we're supposed to do that so jesse's doco comes out and then i get a message from eric i think

1740
02:40:41,400 --> 02:40:46,200
it was on thanksgiving and his face pops up and i didn't know he's a real person i didn't know who

1741
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:51,000
he was suddenly there's just this individual in front of me that knows my thoughts that have never

1742
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:55,480
told anybody else they know everything about my past they know about my future they know about

1743
02:40:55,480 --> 02:41:01,000
all of our future and can put things in my brain for that future all of a sudden his face is on

1744
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:08,520
my phone and i just i like crumbled as a human how long after it was um well that was october

1745
02:41:08,520 --> 02:41:14,200
it was a year later it's november so a year and a month okay but it still brought back everything

1746
02:41:14,200 --> 02:41:20,840
even after that amount of time and i've since gotten to know eric um and and we chat from time

1747
02:41:20,840 --> 02:41:26,360
to time i've learned a lot about his experiences and the things that you know have happened to him

1748
02:41:26,360 --> 02:41:31,000
and the way it's changed him physiologic physiologically his brain his antenna is

1749
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:38,600
cranked up really high um but yeah i know it really challenged a lot of my preconceived notions of

1750
02:41:39,080 --> 02:41:46,200
not just reality but who i am like ego and and living a life that may have not

1751
02:41:46,760 --> 02:41:52,840
necessarily always been based on decisions i felt i was making for me by myself

1752
02:41:54,600 --> 02:42:01,960
um yeah i still struggle with a lot of that stuff but i i think it's i don't know i think

1753
02:42:01,960 --> 02:42:07,080
we should all be asking questions and i'm not alone you know as as i started talking about

1754
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:13,000
this publicly reluctantly there's been so many folks who have reached out to me with similar

1755
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:20,200
experiences it's it's not unique um i think it's just unique that i'm talking about it based on

1756
02:42:22,360 --> 02:42:27,640
what i've sort of structured my career around because it's risky i'm not supposed to be people

1757
02:42:27,640 --> 02:42:33,800
thank me for talking about it um but but i feel like we should how are we going to learn you know

1758
02:42:33,800 --> 02:42:38,360
if we don't talk about all of the crazy things that exist around us how are we ever going to

1759
02:42:38,360 --> 02:42:44,280
learn about just how crazy this world is that we live in what was eric's specific memory of that

1760
02:42:44,280 --> 02:42:51,400
of that moment so for him he what he told me is that he knew he was coming up to meet heidi

1761
02:42:52,120 --> 02:42:58,680
he didn't know what was happening so heidi was i hate using the word taken over you know but i

1762
02:42:58,680 --> 02:43:03,640
don't know what else to use it's not like a body snatchers thing it's just her consciousness was

1763
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:10,680
sort of moved to the side a little and they got in her head down at this halloween party that was

1764
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:16,280
happening and of course people were like oh you're on drugs or no i wasn't i i do enjoy drugs sometimes

1765
02:43:16,280 --> 02:43:22,520
legal ones of course um but but i had one beer and i didn't have any money and she was like

1766
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:28,120
vip room there's tons of beers nobody drank at this vip party will go up there so that's

1767
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:33,640
that's when she was co-opted that's a better word than taking over sure but she was texting

1768
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:37,880
eric to bring him there to perform this thing that apparently took both of them

1769
02:43:38,520 --> 02:43:44,440
he didn't know why he was coming but he saw me out on the balcony sitting in this chair he saw

1770
02:43:44,440 --> 02:43:49,960
her standing behind me and said as soon as he walked in and saw heidi that's when he was switched

1771
02:43:50,040 --> 02:43:58,680
over and from that point on he was them he was used as this conduit through which they were

1772
02:43:58,680 --> 02:44:05,800
doing this thing but i wasn't talking to eric at all i was talking through eric to whatever this

1773
02:44:05,800 --> 02:44:10,840
advanced non-local consciousness is and he was being used for them to talk to me as well

1774
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,400
hmm god

1775
02:44:15,800 --> 02:44:21,640
if the time traveling shit wasn't advanced enough they got to be able to take over our

1776
02:44:21,640 --> 02:44:26,840
consciousness and communicate through beings that are on our timeline at the time in our time frame

1777
02:44:26,840 --> 02:44:33,080
at the time i just assumed he was something else you know uh i had no idea he was a real person

1778
02:44:33,080 --> 02:44:38,440
that almost made it weirder once i found out that he's just like everybody else but has had

1779
02:44:38,440 --> 02:44:44,680
experiences ufo encounters and changes and things but it was easier when i just didn't know

1780
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:50,760
who he was or what he was it almost conjured up more questions once i learned that he's a person

1781
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:59,400
that's wild shit man yeah no it's been weird there's been other things too that have happened a very

1782
02:44:59,400 --> 02:45:05,240
similar thing to that and again once i experienced that i know what it is and what it feels like

1783
02:45:05,960 --> 02:45:11,560
um but they did that to me again about three months later i got the sense that there was

1784
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:17,240
something above my house i can't prove it um and actually a lot of the things that have happened

1785
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:24,680
uh you know can be taken with a grain of salt because i don't have proof this one that they

1786
02:45:24,680 --> 02:45:30,280
did in phoenix i feel like they did intentionally and made sure there were other people involved

1787
02:45:30,280 --> 02:45:34,360
and there were people watching whether they manipulated them too it seemed that they did

1788
02:45:34,360 --> 02:45:39,480
there was one individual inside that remembers feeling concerned and seeing what was happening

1789
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:46,360
out there but not a sense of like who was there he can't put faces on the other people which seems

1790
02:45:46,360 --> 02:45:51,880
to indicate they were sort of being altered as well or the three people that came out and turned

1791
02:45:51,880 --> 02:45:56,920
in unison and walked back inside like that even out of my periphery i was like that's weird um

1792
02:45:57,720 --> 02:46:04,120
so so yeah i don't know um i don't i don't know exactly how deep

1793
02:46:04,920 --> 02:46:10,280
or how far those threads expand outside of what was happening on that balcony but there were other

1794
02:46:10,280 --> 02:46:15,960
people that can corroborate this um that's important the other ones you could write off

1795
02:46:15,960 --> 02:46:22,680
is just schizophrenia or yeah just me experiencing something i don't understand which is fine i i

1796
02:46:22,680 --> 02:46:27,800
don't it you know it's hard when people talk about these things it's hard to find the right

1797
02:46:27,800 --> 02:46:32,440
words it's hard to convey it to people who haven't experienced the same types of things and it also

1798
02:46:32,440 --> 02:46:40,680
just sounds insane i'll be the first to admit that all i can do is tell people honestly and

1799
02:46:40,680 --> 02:46:46,200
with sincerity what happened and allow them to take other data points and form their own opinion

1800
02:46:46,200 --> 02:46:51,880
about what it is and what it might mean you know and i'm not lying it would be really difficult

1801
02:46:51,880 --> 02:46:56,920
to lie i've never been a liar because it seems impossible to like keep a lie going you know you

1802
02:46:56,920 --> 02:47:00,920
have to remember everything you said before so gotta remember the lies yeah i could never do

1803
02:47:00,920 --> 02:47:06,520
that would stress me the hell out so i'm just saying what happened but one thing that did occur

1804
02:47:06,520 --> 02:47:13,000
that there weren't other witnesses too i told my wife about it the next morning is um i was in bed

1805
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:19,800
i got the sense there was something above my house and i woke up and i was like oh shit that's the

1806
02:47:19,800 --> 02:47:25,880
same thing that happened in phoenix like i i felt the information saw like the colored lights coming

1807
02:47:25,880 --> 02:47:31,240
into my brain the same way i did when they blacked out my eyes and put the information of my brain on

1808
02:47:31,240 --> 02:47:37,960
that balcony in phoenix and i sat up i was like oh that's weird it's happening again but there's

1809
02:47:37,960 --> 02:47:42,840
there's no eric right here there's no heidi right here you know what's going on and so i lay back

1810
02:47:42,840 --> 02:47:48,840
down instantly asleep and that never happens to me i'm always up i'm always like ruminating on

1811
02:47:48,840 --> 02:47:55,160
everything that could ever happen to anybody i know and love and it's you know anxiety i never

1812
02:47:55,160 --> 02:48:02,200
just lay down and go back to sleep half hour later on the dot sit up same thing like oh shit you know

1813
02:48:02,200 --> 02:48:07,160
there's the lights and the information again lay back down instantly asleep this happens six

1814
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:13,880
different times every half hour on the mark but it's slower when they did this to me in phoenix

1815
02:48:13,880 --> 02:48:20,040
there was this stream of information coming in at a tremendous speed and when i got up and i

1816
02:48:20,040 --> 02:48:24,040
was allowed to leave i walked through this room of people a woman put her hand on my arm and said

1817
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:30,360
are you okay and i couldn't even lift my head like my head felt like it was 50 pounds and i

1818
02:48:30,360 --> 02:48:35,320
kind of tried to look my eyes i always said uh-huh uh-huh like i was in a such a mesmerized zombie

1819
02:48:35,320 --> 02:48:41,640
like state i just walked through walked down about four doors laid down on the bed with my feet still

1820
02:48:41,640 --> 02:48:47,480
on the floor passed out for like 13 hours woke up same position feet still on the floor i also

1821
02:48:47,480 --> 02:48:53,400
never do that i cannot sleep like that i gotta be laying down but but there were elements to this

1822
02:48:53,400 --> 02:48:59,560
that was happening to me at night where they woke me up every half hour that were just like that the

1823
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:03,240
only thing that was different is the speed at which it was happening is coming in slowly and

1824
02:49:03,240 --> 02:49:08,040
i can't help but wonder if that's because i was asleep if there's like a subconscious element to

1825
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:14,200
where it's easier to do that whereas at that time on the balcony we were running out of time

1826
02:49:14,200 --> 02:49:17,720
people were coming in this is where the after party was gonna be so people were coming in i

1827
02:49:17,720 --> 02:49:23,240
got the sense of urgency in what they were doing not just putting it in there for some future thing

1828
02:49:23,240 --> 02:49:28,520
that seemed urgent in itself but some urgency because of the way people were coming in they

1829
02:49:28,520 --> 02:49:34,280
were like we gotta do this fast and they just shot that shit into my brain and it it hurt you know

1830
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:41,080
like it my head felt heavy and and there was a physiological response i like cried the whole

1831
02:49:41,080 --> 02:49:45,560
next day or at least until they showed up again and took it from me eric just showed up in the

1832
02:49:45,560 --> 02:49:50,760
hallway they apparently realized i wasn't dealing very well with what they just did to me he shows

1833
02:49:50,760 --> 02:49:55,320
up in this empty hallway puts his hand on my shoulder and says are you okay i was cool uh-huh

1834
02:49:55,320 --> 02:50:00,360
yeah like just seeing him again freaked me out to start with and then them knowing where i would be

1835
02:50:00,440 --> 02:50:04,920
knowing i was struggling but they helped you know some kind of reiki thing i don't know what word

1836
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:12,040
to put with it helped alleviate some of that trauma for lack of a better word and i was able

1837
02:50:12,040 --> 02:50:16,760
to finish the conference and then got home and it all just came flooding back but there there was

1838
02:50:16,760 --> 02:50:21,960
clearly a physiological response to whatever they did and putting that information in my brain that

1839
02:50:21,960 --> 02:50:28,520
was much less taxing when they did it while i was asleep hmm yeah that's very interesting you know

1840
02:50:28,520 --> 02:50:32,360
the crazy thing about this whole thing is everyone who has these experiences they seem to be like

1841
02:50:33,800 --> 02:50:40,040
not all of them clearly but a vast majority of the ones that i've heard and spoken to they seem to

1842
02:50:40,040 --> 02:50:46,040
be like super traumatic and like in some cases destroys them yeah i've met those people too

1843
02:50:46,600 --> 02:50:51,400
yeah and then some people what's interesting is some people have reached out saying it was too

1844
02:50:51,400 --> 02:50:56,440
much for them they asked it to stop and it did really yeah and it did and then later once they

1845
02:50:56,440 --> 02:51:01,320
were able to process things they were like oh i'd like that back and they were asking me like how do

1846
02:51:01,320 --> 02:51:05,800
i get that back i don't take some mushrooms or something you know reek rebuild the bridge i don't

1847
02:51:05,800 --> 02:51:11,400
know um but i've i've heard that from a lot of people that was just too much it was too much for

1848
02:51:11,400 --> 02:51:21,160
me honestly yeah like i i was i was a mess for a solid three weeks and then lingeringly on and off

1849
02:51:21,160 --> 02:51:28,840
and then i had sort of um uh another spell about six months after where i was just

1850
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:37,640
i i i really wanted to know what physical reality is what is this existence because when they when

1851
02:51:37,640 --> 02:51:43,480
this happened to me and other things since i i really got the sense that this isn't the primary

1852
02:51:43,480 --> 02:51:48,760
reality that we're a part of not base reality not base reality not source like we're in some sort

1853
02:51:48,760 --> 02:51:55,080
of a simulation or something kind of but i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know maybe

1854
02:51:55,080 --> 02:52:02,040
but but more just like you know the the whole thing big low is trying to do um with best evidence for

1855
02:52:02,040 --> 02:52:08,600
whether the the the we survive bodily death you know and it gets it gets into where do we come

1856
02:52:08,600 --> 02:52:14,280
from where do we go and we die all of those questions i feel like there's some sort of um

1857
02:52:14,280 --> 02:52:21,880
base reality rooted in consciousness and energy and we are manifested forms of that in this

1858
02:52:21,880 --> 02:52:31,320
physical plane given different bodies and a different mode of perception in order to feel

1859
02:52:31,320 --> 02:52:39,800
individual variations in this physical experience in this plane of existence that maybe contributes

1860
02:52:39,800 --> 02:52:47,560
in some way to what is happening in this more transcendental fundamental plane of source

1861
02:52:47,560 --> 02:52:54,680
consciousness if that made any sense at all but i struggle and i don't know i still don't know i

1862
02:52:54,680 --> 02:53:00,200
didn't answer the damn question but i was pissed about it for a while like i was really angry like

1863
02:53:00,200 --> 02:53:05,240
what what is what are dreams how does it connect to this and i was just really jacked up for a

1864
02:53:05,240 --> 02:53:11,800
while about that too and since it's gotten better um but yeah they're on and off for a period of

1865
02:53:11,800 --> 02:53:17,240
six months to a year and so yeah i definitely empathize with people that that it did mess up

1866
02:53:17,960 --> 02:53:24,440
more long term i've kind of come to grips with it and formed a baseline of understanding i don't

1867
02:53:24,440 --> 02:53:29,640
i still don't know what it is or how it relates to any of this but it um it's at least become

1868
02:53:29,640 --> 02:53:38,520
somewhat normalized yeah i mean the the main feeling you get from reading your book from

1869
02:53:38,520 --> 02:53:44,520
the people that have these experiences whether they be sort of you know non-effective on the

1870
02:53:44,520 --> 02:53:48,840
rest of their lives or if they actually negatively affect the rest of their lives is that what was

1871
02:53:48,840 --> 02:53:57,960
going on in that time frame from the 70s to the 2000s um was it needed to be done like it doesn't

1872
02:53:57,960 --> 02:54:04,600
seem like it was good or bad but it was something that was just necessary for the survival of us

1873
02:54:04,600 --> 02:54:10,200
or something bigger than than all of us yeah i think jerry even says that specifically that she

1874
02:54:10,200 --> 02:54:15,720
came to grips with it because she recognized that she was a part of something much bigger and more

1875
02:54:15,720 --> 02:54:21,640
important than she was and it's kind of you know sacrifice the individual for the greater good

1876
02:54:21,640 --> 02:54:26,280
yeah i think that's the the sense that she got after a while and then became more okay with

1877
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:30,600
even though arguably horrific things happened to her her entire life since she was a small child

1878
02:54:31,720 --> 02:54:37,880
and then if it was like so if we were to figure out backwards time travel would would that be

1879
02:54:37,880 --> 02:54:43,640
the same as forwards time travel or is that technologically different or is it is it more

1880
02:54:43,640 --> 02:54:49,560
difficult or do you know anything about this yeah yeah forward time travel is easy that that's

1881
02:54:49,560 --> 02:54:55,720
happening all the time uh you have what mark and scott kelly went into space mark was already the

1882
02:54:55,720 --> 02:55:03,240
older brother um but i think scott kelly was the one the two astronaut twins yeah yeah scott kelly

1883
02:55:03,240 --> 02:55:09,400
was the one i think that was in space for like just over a year right and so mark kelly as the

1884
02:55:09,400 --> 02:55:17,000
older brother uh aged another like five milliseconds compared to his younger brother scott because of

1885
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:21,560
time dilation because of slowing down time yeah so that's time travel into the future essentially

1886
02:55:21,560 --> 02:55:28,120
mark kelly time traveled into the future of his twin brother scott um but yeah time dilation the

1887
02:55:28,120 --> 02:55:32,200
twin paradox that's that's future time travel all you have to do to travel into the future is go

1888
02:55:32,200 --> 02:55:38,360
really fast relative to the speed of light um the physics of backward time travel and the philosophy

1889
02:55:38,360 --> 02:55:45,080
of it and how we understand it is different it comes with a different set of conundrums

1890
02:55:46,040 --> 02:55:53,880
but um i i cited a paper about earman at all two separate papers and i think the extra tempestual

1891
02:55:53,880 --> 02:55:59,320
model where they looked at every criticism of backward time travel they could find in the

1892
02:55:59,320 --> 02:56:07,560
literature this massive literature review yeah and the the title of the paper was uh is back

1893
02:56:07,560 --> 02:56:14,280
is time travel to the past prohibited and they said their conclusion was no there's nothing in

1894
02:56:14,600 --> 02:56:20,360
the laws of physics that would prevent backward time travel and if that's the case given human

1895
02:56:20,360 --> 02:56:25,960
ingenuity and our ability to solve so many different problems our ability to advance

1896
02:56:25,960 --> 02:56:30,840
technology if there's nothing that prohibits backward time travel i think it's only a matter

1897
02:56:30,840 --> 02:56:34,920
of time until we do it we'll figure it out we don't know how to do it now we don't even know

1898
02:56:34,920 --> 02:56:40,920
what time is speaking of like this physical reality versus some conscious reality that may

1899
02:56:40,920 --> 02:56:47,960
exist outside of it and these two may be related we don't know what time is we know it's emergent

1900
02:56:47,960 --> 02:56:53,480
it's called an emergent phenomenon that means it comes from something more fundamental that

1901
02:56:53,480 --> 02:56:57,400
we haven't yet discovered it's one of few things that physicists will actually agree on

1902
02:56:58,600 --> 02:57:04,840
so until we know what that fundamental thing is we can't know what time is because we can't see

1903
02:57:04,840 --> 02:57:09,400
the whole picture there's a big part of this puzzle that's missing yeah there's a huge part

1904
02:57:09,400 --> 02:57:14,360
of the the picture that's just pixelated and outside of our ability to focus on it

1905
02:57:15,240 --> 02:57:22,280
but that doesn't mean it's impossible you know and if it's not impossible then we're going to

1906
02:57:22,280 --> 02:57:26,280
figure it out eventually and i think we already have and i think what we're seeing in the form

1907
02:57:26,280 --> 02:57:34,120
of these craft and the beans that pilot them is is exactly that it's it's an indication that we

1908
02:57:34,120 --> 02:57:38,680
do figure it out in the future and use it to go back to whatever point in the past they can reach

1909
02:57:38,680 --> 02:57:42,840
has anyone ever talked to you or reached out to you that could corroborate

1910
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:49,160
the fact that the government has these crafts and they are in fact time machines that they're

1911
02:57:49,160 --> 02:57:53,720
trying to figure out how to work whether they be depending on how credible they are maybe

1912
02:57:53,720 --> 02:57:58,360
they're credible maybe they're not has anyone ever claimed it yeah uh quite a few people actually

1913
02:57:58,360 --> 02:58:06,200
really yeah um i i'm not gonna you know pick and choose because i don't know whose names i could

1914
02:58:06,200 --> 02:58:10,200
use and who's i couldn't we don't we don't have to say their names yeah some some are people other

1915
02:58:10,200 --> 02:58:18,520
people would know um but yeah it's been mentioned to me many times yeah because you might like if

1916
02:58:19,320 --> 02:58:23,800
if we had the technology and we were able to go back to the past like you would have to be

1917
02:58:23,800 --> 02:58:29,160
very careful and there would have to be i would imagine you'd have to put regulations in place

1918
02:58:29,160 --> 02:58:38,200
yeah for sure to and rules on a who could go and b like what are the rules how much are you

1919
02:58:38,200 --> 02:58:44,280
allowed to interact non-interference yeah right and you know honestly i think that bolsters the

1920
02:58:44,280 --> 02:58:50,120
case for this theory because an argument could be made if these extraterrestrials are traveling

1921
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:56,680
you know light years to get here millions of miles why wouldn't they introduce themselves

1922
02:58:56,680 --> 02:59:02,920
upon a rifle or kill us and take all of our stuff yes slave us you know um but right exactly if they

1923
02:59:02,920 --> 02:59:07,640
are coming from the future you don't want to back to the future too scenario where biff gets rich

1924
02:59:07,640 --> 02:59:14,360
off of sports betting and just starts an empire you know um or maybe you would right yeah you'd

1925
02:59:14,360 --> 02:59:19,640
imagine sports betters would be making a killing off yeah no that yeah or like how you talk about

1926
02:59:19,640 --> 02:59:25,800
is the um the tourist idea of like yeah time tourists let's get fucked up and go check out

1927
02:59:25,800 --> 02:59:31,400
these crazy apes you know in las vegas yeah absolutely i mean or to go back and you know

1928
02:59:31,400 --> 02:59:36,440
see jesus crucifixion or how they built the pyramids and all these different landmarks and

1929
02:59:36,440 --> 02:59:42,440
i mentioned too in that same section of the book that the most visited sites are these ancient

1930
02:59:42,440 --> 02:59:46,760
historic and prehistoric sites that's where tourists want to go so we go there and we imagine what it

1931
02:59:46,760 --> 02:59:51,880
would look like if you could actually go to the time that was like the period that they were making

1932
02:59:51,880 --> 02:59:56,520
these things you could see how they lived and interact with each other and understand there

1933
02:59:56,520 --> 03:00:02,040
were poets and writers at the time of jesus and see what what people are doing in their day-to-day

1934
03:00:02,040 --> 03:00:08,680
lives you'd pay a ton of money for that opportunity so yeah outside of us inventing backward time

1935
03:00:08,680 --> 03:00:15,480
travel to mitigate the the twin paradox effect where you want to go home not just to your planet

1936
03:00:15,480 --> 03:00:21,880
but to your time to see when your family's still alive right you would probably uh also invent it

1937
03:00:21,880 --> 03:00:30,680
there would be a motivation to invent it to fill that demand side economic aspect of going back

1938
03:00:30,680 --> 03:00:35,080
in time one other thing related this just this conversation just made me think of it is another

1939
03:00:35,080 --> 03:00:41,480
line of evidence too is based on what we would do in a longitudinal study of an individual

1940
03:00:42,040 --> 03:00:48,520
is very similar to what those individuals who are lifelong abductees describe in these cases

1941
03:00:48,520 --> 03:00:53,240
where they're picked up as a small child throughout their teens 20s 30s whenever

1942
03:00:53,240 --> 03:00:58,280
as an aged adult they know these people they've been interacting with them their entire life

1943
03:00:58,280 --> 03:01:03,880
but case after case they say they don't age and that's exactly what you expect if they're using

1944
03:01:03,880 --> 03:01:09,240
time travel in order to do that you could do a whole longitudinal study on that one individual

1945
03:01:09,240 --> 03:01:13,480
that for them the the abductee would be a lifetime but for the researchers

1946
03:01:13,480 --> 03:01:17,960
researchers might be one or two days yeah um they just pop in and out and get them when they want

1947
03:01:17,960 --> 03:01:22,120
Whitley said the being that he asked that he thought was a female he asked how old she was

1948
03:01:22,120 --> 03:01:30,600
and she said ancient yeah answer she's probably right ancient and wise i would add that too

1949
03:01:30,600 --> 03:01:35,080
another pattern that emerged from this book is oftentimes these lifelong abductees they're the

1950
03:01:35,080 --> 03:01:41,000
opposite gender of the person that's taken yeah that's so like i don't know why it's just a

1951
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:47,640
pattern that emerged in case after case willy had sex with his too i know it's pretty wild

1952
03:01:47,640 --> 03:01:53,480
wild account and um so david huggins yeah that's another thing like they're so advanced why can't

1953
03:01:53,480 --> 03:02:02,120
they just reproduce or like like figure out how to cross breed us with them in a better way than

1954
03:02:02,120 --> 03:02:09,000
like primitive i mean have you ever had sex it's super fun yeah i guess i mean yeah no i guess

1955
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:13,960
primitive is even more fun yeah sometimes it depends on your mood and you know yeah if you're

1956
03:02:13,960 --> 03:02:20,200
somebody if you're some you know if you're some billionaire living in you know a million years

1957
03:02:20,200 --> 03:02:27,160
from now like would you want to go back and and have sex with a primitive ape or a primitive human

1958
03:02:27,160 --> 03:02:33,960
yes i don't know yes you would yeah actually so i mean i wouldn't want to go back and

1959
03:02:33,960 --> 03:02:40,200
australia pithecus i i i think well i'm a horny guy so i'm sorry i just gotta put that out there

1960
03:02:40,200 --> 03:02:45,880
but sick fuck my part of my sick fuckingness uh needs to be acknowledged right now because this

1961
03:02:45,880 --> 03:02:53,080
this book we've touched on a number of interesting um aspects of the storyline but the main character

1962
03:02:53,080 --> 03:02:58,040
it's a female protagonist in this book the main character is an intertemporal sex researcher

1963
03:02:58,680 --> 03:03:01,960
that's her job she goes back which book are we talking about this one this one right here

1964
03:03:01,960 --> 03:03:07,720
okay revelation the future human past she is an anthropologist from the future whose job is to

1965
03:03:07,720 --> 03:03:13,080
go back and fuck everybody from these different times to learn about sex because they don't have

1966
03:03:13,080 --> 03:03:18,040
sex in the future i sort of took that atrophy genitals thing and ran with it they stopped

1967
03:03:18,040 --> 03:03:23,960
having sex her job is to go back and study it in order to learn about it so she can teach

1968
03:03:23,960 --> 03:03:29,000
people of the future about the the primitive keen as you said it's a very it's a very important

1969
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:35,880
theme actually a buddy of mine he's a he as soon as this came out he was like sex drugs and ufos

1970
03:03:35,880 --> 03:03:42,520
baby because that's what this book is it's like um sort of an exploration of basic human drives

1971
03:03:43,080 --> 03:03:49,640
and instincts in the context of war violence religion but also very much sex

1972
03:03:50,440 --> 03:03:57,400
it's a it's a wild ride wow man well we just did a little bit over three hours seriously

1973
03:03:57,400 --> 03:04:05,880
yeah jesus christ i had no idea that was fun yeah that was great um what is in your future

1974
03:04:05,880 --> 03:04:10,520
as far as work books is there anything else new you're looking at that you're going to talk about

1975
03:04:10,600 --> 03:04:17,320
soon or um yeah i've kind of had to pull back a little bit um not quitting in case anybody's

1976
03:04:17,320 --> 03:04:22,200
listening uh that's what got me in trouble in phoenix yeah don't fucking tell them to portal

1977
03:04:22,200 --> 03:04:28,760
through me i don't want none of that no i i recently became chair of our department

1978
03:04:28,760 --> 03:04:34,920
at the university where i teach and i had no idea what kind of time suck that was going to be until

1979
03:04:34,920 --> 03:04:41,720
recently um so i've kind of had to pull back a little bit i started writing a new book in um may

1980
03:04:42,360 --> 03:04:48,120
after spring semester let out which was gonna it doesn't matter i don't even know if i'll be

1981
03:04:48,120 --> 03:04:54,200
able to write it anymore but then um some things happened we had a crypto terrestrial paper come

1982
03:04:54,200 --> 03:05:01,400
out and i sort of had to do a lot of uh public relations with that and then some other things

1983
03:05:01,400 --> 03:05:10,280
and so so yeah long story short uh i'm basically trying to focus on getting my legs beneath me

1984
03:05:10,840 --> 03:05:17,720
being the chair of our department and focus on university jobs family just being home more um

1985
03:05:17,720 --> 03:05:24,280
being present in my children's lives but still obviously engaged in this topic i can't not be

1986
03:05:24,280 --> 03:05:28,440
you know like i said it's one of few things that i could talk about endlessly for three hours and

1987
03:05:28,440 --> 03:05:33,240
feeling like it was 20 minutes i had no idea three hours had gone by um but i don't have any

1988
03:05:33,240 --> 03:05:38,680
big projects right now well with that said some of the researchers that uh have been i've been

1989
03:05:38,680 --> 03:05:43,880
collaborating with some researchers at various institutions on some academic papers we had one

1990
03:05:43,880 --> 03:05:49,000
come out in june about the crypto terrestrial theory and it got a lot of attention globally

1991
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:56,760
what is that theory it's the idea that there's an advanced um civilization sequestering themselves

1992
03:05:56,760 --> 03:06:01,720
in earth's environs whether it be far side of the moon under the water a lot of things we talked

1993
03:06:01,720 --> 03:06:07,800
about honestly right we published a pretty vast paper i think was something like 35 000 words

1994
03:06:07,800 --> 03:06:15,640
and it kind of went viral um i had to do a ton of interviews with pretty respectable news outlets

1995
03:06:15,640 --> 03:06:20,440
it was kind of mainstream media in some cases we always criticized them for not getting involved

1996
03:06:20,440 --> 03:06:24,440
in this but and they took it seriously it was it was amazing it was so cool to see i had something

1997
03:06:24,440 --> 03:06:32,360
similar happen in 2019 it's also that which is crazy into itself under itself as well um so yeah

1998
03:06:32,360 --> 03:06:37,560
it's been kind of fun doing that but there's only so many hours in the day but we are continuing to

1999
03:06:37,560 --> 03:06:43,480
publish a couple papers we're working on one right now uh that's likely to come out in december that

2000
03:06:43,480 --> 03:06:49,720
kind of also touches on a lot of things we've been discussing in the context of um you know the ufo

2001
03:06:49,720 --> 03:06:56,120
phenomenon but also the angels and demons thing um different perceptions but also maybe some

2002
03:06:56,120 --> 03:07:01,000
literal translations of various events that have occurred and how we might understand them in the

2003
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:06,840
context of this phenomenon so we're still putting papers out one's actually kind of interesting that

2004
03:07:06,840 --> 03:07:16,280
looks at um a way we might be able to statistically model the the relevance and validity of different

2005
03:07:16,280 --> 03:07:23,800
cases so applying a standard uh means with which to take a new case and apply this method to it

2006
03:07:23,800 --> 03:07:30,360
and then it graphs in physical space uh different important elements to it so a lot like what jalen

2007
03:07:30,360 --> 03:07:37,000
heineck did and the ufo experience i think is what it was called um his like um reliability

2008
03:07:37,960 --> 03:07:46,280
metric and um what were they called like oddness and reliability or something right right right

2009
03:07:46,280 --> 03:07:50,920
i think a lot of your like cataloging everything and trying to find like yeah with the timeline

2010
03:07:50,920 --> 03:07:55,640
with the ufo timeline kind of but it applies a matrix to it okay it's like a matrix that that

2011
03:07:55,640 --> 03:08:00,680
plots out these things and then also what we want to do is give it to different subgroups so like

2012
03:08:00,680 --> 03:08:06,040
give it to skeptics and see where that same case would plot based on that that demographic group

2013
03:08:06,120 --> 03:08:11,720
give it to believers skeptics scientists um people in congress you know and and have visual

2014
03:08:11,720 --> 03:08:17,880
representation that we can make open source where we can get a big sample size and then tease apart

2015
03:08:17,880 --> 03:08:21,080
that data there's a number of studies that could come from that into itself but we want to have

2016
03:08:21,080 --> 03:08:26,280
this standardized measure so i'm working with these other phds at institutions in the uk us

2017
03:08:27,080 --> 03:08:34,360
brazil as well to try to um yeah add more legitimacy to this by publishing peer-reviewed

2018
03:08:34,360 --> 03:08:40,200
academic papers um that's funny i just said i'm not doing anything to focus on my uni job and

2019
03:08:41,240 --> 03:08:46,200
forgot about all this other stuff but it's a juggling act i mean you know it's easy to

2020
03:08:46,200 --> 03:08:52,360
get ufo burnout um but it's important you know i feel like it is important because it might be

2021
03:08:52,360 --> 03:08:57,720
one of the biggest questions of our time so i appreciate you doing this and the show this

2022
03:08:57,720 --> 03:09:02,760
beautiful space and yeah i think the more we can just keep talking the more we're gonna hopefully

2023
03:09:02,760 --> 03:09:08,200
chip away at the reality of this and maybe even eventually figure out what it is i agree man and

2024
03:09:08,200 --> 03:09:13,320
like i said that book is probably one of the most compelling cases i've ever i've ever witnessed to

2025
03:09:13,320 --> 03:09:18,520
this thing i think it makes a ton of sense um tell people where they can find your work follow you

2026
03:09:18,520 --> 03:09:24,440
do you have social media all that stuff yeah yeah for better or worse i'm on all the socials uh the

2027
03:09:24,440 --> 03:09:30,200
twitter the facebook the instagram um i've got a website too which actually has links to all of

2028
03:09:30,200 --> 03:09:39,160
those and to the books and um some upcoming events i'll be in denver uh next month at their move on

2029
03:09:41,240 --> 03:09:45,000
colorado move on i guess they're one of the biggest move on groups oh really colorado

2030
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:49,640
yeah colorado and um phoenix i think those are the two biggest ones so this will be the

2031
03:09:50,520 --> 03:09:57,880
kind of a fun talk um i believe it's in centennial to south of denver september 14th or something

2032
03:09:57,880 --> 03:10:04,360
other than that i don't i don't do a lot of talks anymore um it's just that's a lot of work but i do

2033
03:10:04,360 --> 03:10:08,680
love these conversations so i appreciate you yeah man fight me down for this was very fun been a ton

2034
