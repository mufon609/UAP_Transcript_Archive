1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
It's not like trying to summon a spirit.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,760
You're summoning essentially technology

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,760
that has consciousness to it.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,760
Well, that platform came into that craft itself.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,040
So this thing was either anti-gravitic itself

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,960
and how it basically merged in together.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,200
Could this just be like an occult thing

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,000
that's been going on for hundreds of years?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,440
I mean, how do you think they learned?

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,120
They were actually two of the guys

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,320
were actually talking about either,

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,960
hey, should we smoke these guys right now?

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,600
You know, that's what they kept saying.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,440
Do you think realistically pulling these technologies

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,040
from these black programs

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,440
and putting them into the hands of people

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,520
who don't know what the fuck they're doing is a smart move?

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,760
James Allen, the documentarian of Mark McCandalish

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,240
and the Flexliner story.

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,400
He was diagnosed and dead

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,960
of an aggressive form of cancer in about three weeks.

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,520
Yeah, the UFO stuff's cool because they fly.

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,800
The medical shit, the stuff that we could also do

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,400
with this technology is gonna be far more advanced.

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,620
The

26
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,260
different

27
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:16,420
parts of the brain

28
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,360
have different activities.

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,440
I'm here with Michael Herrera

30
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,320
and I couldn't be more excited to talk to you.

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,400
This has been a long time coming.

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,960
You were a former Marine who experienced something

33
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,960
just really fascinating in 2009 in Indonesia in the jungle.

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,800
And it involves craft that prosaically is not understood

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,060
as far as how it works.

36
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,580
And also seemingly special forces,

37
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,320
we don't know if it was special forces,

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,860
you don't describe them definitely as special forces,

39
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,800
but a team with prowess and wherewithal

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,960
as far as the machinery they're using

41
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,160
and how smooth they're operating,

42
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,080
that also seems like at another level

43
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,520
and they're kind of apprehending you when you see this craft.

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,360
And so I'm very excited to talk to you.

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,400
I know it took a lot of courage for you to speak out.

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,920
And then we have Sammy UAP Gerb as well here,

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,360
who's a legend, has an amazing channel,

48
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,120
goes as deep as anybody when it comes

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,240
to actual legacy operations from like a core detail way,

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,700
just the facts.

51
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,360
And so very excited to have you, man.

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,320
You guys have done a great show together too.

53
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,740
And if you guys want like very low level details

54
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,060
as to what went down, drawings, pictures, illustrations,

55
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,040
extremely detailed accounts, go to your channel

56
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,760
because you have some great stuff with Michael.

57
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,800
He's very thorough, which is something that's very rare.

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,120
Especially in this space, it's extremely rare.

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,320
Correct, and that's kind of the thing

60
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,160
why it made easier to talk to you

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,120
because you were actually able to connect the dots

62
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,240
and see and compare notes basically

63
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,480
to what you've experienced with talking to other people.

64
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,420
I mean, your story had been floating around for a while

65
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,360
and people were pretty dismissive of it

66
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,240
until our mutual friend, Joey is not my name,

67
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,480
started to reach out to you and speak to you.

68
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,920
And he got me in contact with you

69
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,980
and you were able to provide quite a bit

70
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,480
of interesting information, including direct evidence

71
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,880
from yourself and Joey that you met up with a,

72
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,800
who you referred to at the time as an insider,

73
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
who now turned out to be Jake Barber.

74
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,120
Correct, and that was the thing

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,400
that I was kind of weirded out about.

76
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,480
So in 2023, when I testified with the National Press Club,

77
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,560
obviously I got in touch with a Greer, actually in 2018.

78
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,720
So I went to an event that he had in Boulder, Colorado,

79
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,680
and listened to his lecture, things like that.

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,240
I was saying 2017 because the ex I was with at the time,

81
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,960
I met her in 2017, but then I was like, okay.

82
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,880
And then I started thinking,

83
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,320
because there's been some people on Twitter

84
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,520
that was 2018 because one of the volunteers was there.

85
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,680
So I was like, okay, so it is really 2018.

86
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,640
And I had listened to his lecture,

87
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,920
and then I ended up going up to,

88
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,940
he was doing a book signing.

89
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,520
So I went and got a book

90
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,200
because that was the only way to get in front of him.

91
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
At the time when he was doing book signings,

92
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,440
he doesn't do that anymore

93
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,280
because people can get very crazy.

94
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,520
I've seen it firsthand.

95
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,920
It's a little hysterical, but this subject

96
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,960
brings a very interesting crowd with it,

97
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,760
which is something I don't relate to whatsoever.

98
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,680
But I mean, to who of their own?

99
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,680
So I had told him, I'm a former Marine.

100
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,760
I had witnessed something such as like

101
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,720
a drug running operation using this kind of technology.

102
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,080
Do you know anything about that?

103
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,200
So I was trying to get his attention.

104
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,880
He was kind of like, yeah, I've heard a lot.

105
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,600
But then when I said that, he told everybody to shut up.

106
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,040
And he stood up and handed me his card,

107
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,120
and he was like, don't tell anybody this information.

108
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,260
Don't relate to anybody.

109
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,340
Just keep it between us.

110
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,860
Contact me when you're ready.

111
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,820
And then when he did the first episode of Sean Ryan,

112
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,220
is when basically he was talking about

113
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,460
the whistleblower protections

114
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,420
and going through the system

115
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,740
to basically go through that route.

116
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,300
So I was like, you know what?

117
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,460
That might be time to actually pull a trigger on this

118
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,420
and see what can come of it.

119
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,060
This is the Gallagher Amendment

120
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,220
around whistleblower protection.

121
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,060
NDA, National Defense Authorization Act.

122
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,020
Yeah, it's part of the National Defense Authorization Act.

123
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,420
And that was coming into 2023, I think,

124
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,260
is when they passed that.

125
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,660
And there was some rendition

126
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,820
of which we were trying to do 2024

127
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,380
with the whole amnesty period for six months.

128
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,580
And then obviously,

129
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,500
eminent domain with some of these technologies

130
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,940
and assets that these black sides have.

131
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,300
So when I approached,

132
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,780
I got in touch with Greer again,

133
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,060
sent him an email, said,

134
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,900
I don't know if you remember me.

135
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,180
And he goes, I know exactly.

136
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,980
And I remember exactly who you are, which was weird.

137
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,060
So he gave me his phone number.

138
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,980
So I called him.

139
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,380
We basically talked for about an hour,

140
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,220
just kind of went through what I've already discussed

141
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,340
publicly, which was essentially

142
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,220
that we were a part of 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit

143
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,620
that was tasked out to basically respond

144
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,220
to a humanitarian assistance operation

145
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,900
out in the Philippines, which was Operation Katsana.

146
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,260
And then what ended up happening was we were the only ship,

147
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,940
which was the USS Denver that got routed out

148
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,420
to the western part of Sumatra in Indonesia.

149
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,820
And which was a little weird,

150
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,660
but you know, of course,

151
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,260
I've never been on a mission before that point.

152
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,380
So that was kind of the first one for me.

153
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,860
Why were you guys rerouted?

154
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,740
It was the only ship,

155
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,180
but that was the orders we were given.

156
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,900
I don't know specifically why.

157
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,780
There was speculation.

158
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,220
And then when we actually got briefed at the,

159
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,500
in the ward room,

160
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,820
that there were some Obama's family members that were there.

161
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,660
So they had some SEAL team that was gonna be there

162
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,300
to retrieve those people if need be.

163
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,140
That's interesting.

164
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,260
Because Obama lived there from age six to 10,

165
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,100
I believe. I believe so.

166
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,420
With his mom or something. Yeah.

167
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,900
And so there were some relatives

168
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,820
and they were gonna get them out

169
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,580
because what happens in that part of the world

170
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,580
is when there's a natural disaster happens,

171
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,860
usually these terrorist organizations

172
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,980
or these insurgent groups

173
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,300
will typically try to take over that area

174
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,180
and inflict harm, chaos, ransom,

175
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,820
I mean, whatever they do.

176
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,500
And so they were afraid of that.

177
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,140
So that's why they sent a reactionary force

178
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,020
to basically go coordinate the area off

179
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,060
and then go deal with that,

180
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,780
which we didn't do too much of that.

181
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,540
All we basically did was try to provide security for an LZ

182
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,900
so that way they can keep,

183
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,500
you know, we can keep if there were people there,

184
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,780
which this particular LZ didn't have anybody there,

185
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,620
which was weird.

186
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,020
For the audience, what's an LZ?

187
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,300
Landing zone.

188
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,220
It's more like a hasty LZ.

189
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,660
So hasty LZ means it's a hasty landing zone.

190
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,620
So it's something that wasn't like prepared ahead of time.

191
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,460
Like we're gonna plot here and this is where we're gonna go.

192
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,820
It's just like, here's the clearing.

193
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,980
This is where they're gonna land.

194
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,700
At least it's how it felt.

195
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,380
Pilots can probably attest to something different.

196
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,380
I don't know.

197
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,380
And then basically that's when we disembarked the helicopter

198
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,140
and for us, it's like, okay,

199
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,500
you're gonna have the tactical advantage,

200
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,340
take the high ground.

201
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,020
So that's what we decided to do.

202
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,220
And I wasn't the one who was in charge of all this,

203
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,940
so it was weird to not have the comms

204
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,700
because everybody's talking about that.

205
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,820
I was not the one who set up.

206
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,700
Maybe the squad leader,

207
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,700
whoever was in charge of that point had something.

208
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,500
So you guys had no comms, no signals.

209
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,340
To my knowledge, no.

210
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,900
I don't remember anybody having that.

211
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,700
We could have had a little radio or something

212
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,820
that the sergeant that was there at the time said.

213
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,380
You're sent into the jungle alone basically

214
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,540
with your unit.

215
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,660
Correct.

216
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,420
So it's like a fire team plus two, so six guys.

217
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,620
And so we ended up seeing this craft,

218
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,460
which.

219
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,260
That's amazing.

220
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,100
Who made this?

221
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,980
So I was actually looking for other accounts

222
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,460
of octagonal craft that people may have seen.

223
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,260
So I did a quick Google search,

224
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,300
came across this on Etsy.

225
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,580
And so some, I can't remember the gentleman's name,

226
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,900
but I ended up getting in touch with him

227
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,220
and told him who I was.

228
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,460
So he sent me two of these.

229
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,100
One, I signed for him and sent it back to him

230
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,300
so he can have that.

231
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,220
And two, because he hooked me up with two models.

232
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,580
But did he make that to spec

233
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,020
or he had already built that?

234
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,660
No, he made this to spec.

235
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,140
So this was after the fact of what I came forward with.

236
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,140
But this essentially is what we saw.

237
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,780
It almost looks like a fractal.

238
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,860
You have kind of an accentuated version

239
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,580
of the eight-gon or octagon shape on top

240
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,420
that's like a pyramid.

241
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,420
And then you have a less concave version in the middle

242
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,740
and then like an even less, more kind of spread out version.

243
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,940
And this is off from memory because what people,

244
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,780
the SOS was like a very matte black,

245
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,980
but then it was also transitioning

246
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,820
like a light matte gray.

247
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,940
And I don't know if it was we were going down this hill

248
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,140
and we could still kind of see it

249
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,060
and maybe sun was hitting it to an extent or I don't know,

250
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,500
but it was basically like it was changing colors.

251
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,140
But this panel right here, whatever these are,

252
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,180
were basically the very vantablack,

253
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,740
which was the blackest I've ever seen anything.

254
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,860
It was like light could get absorbed into this.

255
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,540
Almost like a black hole or something.

256
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,220
Kind of, that's the only way I can describe it.

257
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,900
Or vantablack is this car, this BMW car.

258
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,860
The paint that they did that it basically absorbs light.

259
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,300
It's very crazy stuff.

260
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,420
So that's what that reminded me of.

261
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,500
But I estimated that this thing was probably about 300 feet.

262
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,020
And when we ended up getting into this clearing

263
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,580
is basically when we were intercepted by this force.

264
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,380
So Aero put out a report that was completely false

265
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,420
because I didn't say it was US special operations.

266
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,980
That never came out of my mouth.

267
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,220
What I hypothesized is that they were at some point

268
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,300
because the tactics they used,

269
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,260
they already had the drop on us

270
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
by the time we even noticed them.

271
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,020
So yeah, you got, you know, armchair generals out there

272
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,460
who said, oh yeah, I wouldn't have done that.

273
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,420
I would have fired on them.

274
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,420
It's like, yeah, good luck with that,

275
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,580
but get pulled over by a cop and have a weapon

276
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,780
and see how fast you can reach him

277
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,500
while he's already got his drawn on him.

278
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,740
We'll see how well that works for you.

279
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,700
You know, FAFO.

280
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,660
You and your fellow Marines,

281
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,500
you did not have rounds chambered.

282
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,340
No, we did not.

283
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,380
When you were encountered in like a pincer formation.

284
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,540
We were in condition three.

285
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
So all we had was a magazine insert.

286
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,260
So all you have to do is hit the charging handle

287
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,100
to chamber around.

288
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,140
But if we're sitting there patrolling,

289
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,220
this is the funny thing is there's a lot of optics

290
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,100
that are played and stuff like this, right?

291
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,540
So it's not like you're wanting to use this now.

292
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,300
Granted, Indonesia is the second largest terrorist capital

293
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,620
in the world, but it doesn't necessarily mean

294
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,300
that you're gonna encounter any kind of bad guys,

295
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,780
which we really didn't encounter that.

296
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,140
And for these operators who we encountered,

297
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,980
who's to say that they're really bad?

298
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,340
Because the difference is if we were to do

299
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,780
an operation ourselves, and we had people,

300
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,300
we had no idea that we're armed coming up to us,

301
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,940
I'm pretty sure we'd react in the same way,

302
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,580
especially if there's something that's going on

303
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,260
that we either need to protect people,

304
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,820
protect assets or something going on.

305
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,420
We're not gonna have the same kind of welcoming,

306
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,620
like, yeah, go ahead and take a look, guys, you know?

307
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,860
Before we speculate on what was going on there,

308
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,260
just the core details, how long did you get a clean shot,

309
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,180
like a look at that craft?

310
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,940
Several times, because while we're being held up

311
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,100
at gunpoint, which these guys are at standoff distance,

312
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,860
it's not like they're sitting there pointing a muzzle

313
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,580
right at your face like this close,

314
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,300
because, you know, that's only Hollywood that does that,

315
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,700
and these guys are smart enough,

316
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,540
just like in the military,

317
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,980
you're gonna be at a standoff distance,

318
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,740
so nobody can get the advantage of you

319
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,100
trying to disarm you, whatever it might be.

320
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,260
So, but frequently dealing with these guys

321
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,580
and dealing with that craft, it's just going back and forth.

322
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,860
So, like, how long is this process

323
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,300
where you have a clean look at the craft?

324
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,220
Is it like, it's minutes, it's not?

325
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,060
It's minutes.

326
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,020
Okay, wow.

327
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,580
It's nothing like substantially long.

328
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,940
It's just enough because, like I said,

329
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,700
these trucks were coming up,

330
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,740
which were either Tundras or F-350s,

331
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,420
more likely they're probably Tundras,

332
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,940
but the only thing I could make out

333
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,660
was that it was some sort of heavy duty truck

334
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,220
that was built on that, some sort of chassis,

335
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,140
that was big enough to pull these containers.

336
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,180
And how close are you to the craft

337
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,220
while you're being apprehended?

338
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,340
Maybe 150, 300 meters, if that,

339
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,260
because the way, like, this clearing was pretty big,

340
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,060
but this craft was enormous.

341
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,820
And there was, because even in the rendition,

342
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,260
there's like a platform below the craft.

343
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,980
And do you have any, like, first intuitions

344
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,820
as to what that served as,

345
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,660
the platform versus the craft itself?

346
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,540
Well, that platform came into that craft itself.

347
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,340
It lifted off the ground.

348
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,060
Now, when you're looking at it like this,

349
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,900
I mean, of course, you can see

350
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,460
that there's, like, a metal pole there

351
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,300
to basically hold this up up top,

352
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,900
but there was no metal pole or nothing to support that,

353
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,380
right, so this thing was either anti-gravitic itself

354
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,620
and how it basically merged in together.

355
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,300
So it's something like, it's very,

356
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,060
like, there's Air Force cargo planes

357
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,740
that basically detach the fuselage

358
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,140
so that way they can just roll the plane off,

359
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,460
load up everything, load it, and then just take off.

360
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,700
I'm, I can't even speak today.

361
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,660
I'm hypothesizing that there might be

362
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,780
the same kind of concept, just something very quick.

363
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,220
They just load up, get whatever they want,

364
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,300
and get the hell out of there.

365
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,860
And so these guys apprehend you,

366
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,300
and what sort of equipment do they have?

367
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,060
Do they say anything interesting?

368
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,860
They're obviously talking about they want to smoke us

369
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,180
or what should we do with these guys?

370
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,020
They're making threats.

371
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,100
We can get lost out here.

372
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,660
We can, you know, take you anywhere pretty much.

373
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,500
We can kill you.

374
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,540
Should we shoot these guys?

375
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,380
You know, it's going back and forth.

376
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,820
There was only just two of them talking with us,

377
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,220
but you could tell by their dialects

378
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,060
that they were American.

379
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,460
You can tell by their facial expressions

380
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,300
that they were, you know, they were serious people.

381
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,220
How many are they versus how many are you?

382
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,740
So there are six of us and there are eight of them.

383
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
Okay.

384
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,380
And they, like I said, they were split off.

385
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,940
So when they kind of approached us

386
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,140
when we were going down in a tactical column,

387
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,740
there were four and four on each side.

388
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,260
So they basically almost have what they call a nosebleed.

389
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,780
So they basically had sectors of fire like this.

390
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,940
So for them to fire upon us,

391
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,100
it's not going to take as many rounds

392
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,020
because they could just hit us instantaneously.

393
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,260
So these guys knew what the hell they were doing.

394
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,220
And that was interesting, you know,

395
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,300
having thought about at least

396
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,780
what these guys' backgrounds could be,

397
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,580
then Jake comes forward, which is interesting,

398
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,740
especially his background and his people, you know,

399
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,220
so very good guys, by the way.

400
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,780
But these guys in particular,

401
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,620
I mean, they were so fluid and so smooth,

402
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,940
it's like they've done this several times.

403
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,420
It's just protocol.

404
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,540
They just know it so well.

405
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,740
It was just very fluid.

406
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,660
Hey guys, I wanted to tell you

407
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,860
about my new favorite piece of apparel.

408
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,420
These are called the Perfect Jeans.

409
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,340
They're literally the perfect jeans.

410
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,940
I used to wear jeans all the time

411
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,140
and they're kind of rough

412
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,540
and not super stretchy or breathable.

413
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,620
These are extremely comfortable.

414
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,620
They work in casual environments.

415
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,460
They work in work settings.

416
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,060
They come in six different sizes

417
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,700
from 26 inches to 50 inches

418
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,140
and they're all around just amazing.

419
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,100

430
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,180
Fuck your khakis, get the perfect jean.

431
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,180
So when they apprehend us,

432
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,020
they basically take our weapons from us

433
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,500
and they're just taking the magazines out.

434
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,340
They're checking to make sure

435
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,900
there's nothing wrapped in there, which there wasn't.

436
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,220
I think they may have said something about that too.

437
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,540
And because there's no way if they would have engaged us

438
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,340
and we have to raise our weapon up and it's not chambered,

439
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,460
well, yeah, you're gonna have to rack around in the chamber

440
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,460
and then flip it off safe on fire

441
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,980
while they already have their safe.

442
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,820
You could hear them flip them off

443
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,540
and then basically just, they could have got us.

444
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,900
You heard the safeties flip off.

445
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,020
Oh yeah. Wow.

446
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,260
And did they have any other equipment?

447
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,260
They had something that was like a biometrics,

448
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,820
it's like a bat system

449
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,580
because that's something that we were kind of

450
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,540
taught a little bit on how to track people,

451
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,740
see biometrics tracking.

452
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,740
And so when insurgents were having this used on them,

453
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,540
it takes fingerprints, it takes pictures

454
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,380
and all that kind of stuff.

455
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,700
They had something very similar to that.

456
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,100
And then they had like a-

457
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,820
Did they take photos or fingerprints?

458
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,660
They were trying to take,

459
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,860
so they took our CAD cards out of our pockets,

460
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,660
which we always have our CAD cards in our left breast pocket.

461
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,260
And so when they took that out,

462
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,980
they were trying to scan them and I don't know if it didn't

463
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,380
work or whatever, they were getting frustrated with it.

464
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,540
And then this is when they took out another device

465
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,820
that looked like a modern day smartphone, very thin.

466
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,300
And then I've had people that were formerly of the CIA

467
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,300
tell me that these are CAVCOM devices that they use.

468
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,340
And that's basically what they were able to translate

469
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,780
and get that information to whoever had it.

470
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,180
Cause they knew who we were after that point

471
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,660
because they had our IDs, had our names,

472
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,660
had our ranks, everything.

473
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,220
So as that's going on, they're searching us down,

474
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,900
which I had before making that trip down the hill,

475
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,940
I had a little Panasonic camera

476
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,420
that I actually took pictures of this thing

477
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,140
with from a top view, at least because there's some parts

478
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,420
of it that were obscured because of vegetation.

479
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,460
And I also had pictures of the helicopter,

480
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,740
like one of them was when we were on the ship

481
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,300
and I had all these photos that I took,

482
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,220
even out of town and all that.

483
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,540
And they didn't find it in my dump pouch, which was good.

484
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,260
Cause then the whole time I'm thinking like,

485
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,940
I got something that can fucking prove this.

486
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,460
It's not just fucking hearsay, right?

487
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,420
And so...

488
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,420
What do you have that could prove it?

489
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,260
The pictures.

490
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,020
You had the pictures and that was in your pouch.

491
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,180
That was in my pouch.

492
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,860
They never searched that pouch.

493
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,300
So I was a saw gunner by trade.

494
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,660
So that's what we always had was, you know,

495
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,860
everybody has a pouch, but typically I just had like

496
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,020
drum mag pouches instead of a regular M16

497
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,020
or M4 magazine pouches, which I had a magazine pouch

498
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,700
right here just in case we had to use magazines

499
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,820
for the saw because it could take both,

500
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,380
belt fed with magazines.

501
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,100
So as they're going through us,

502
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,580
they're basically searching us up and down.

503
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,980
And then they're basically just threatening us again,

504
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,420
just kind of roughing us up a little bit.

505
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,780
And then that's when the trucks started coming because yeah,

506
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,820
I'm paying attention to these guys that are doing this stuff

507
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,980
to us and then all of a sudden I'm paying attention

508
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,780
to these trucks that we start seeing them pull up

509
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,020
and they have these trailers on the back

510
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,940
that have this HVAC system on the top.

511
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,500
So that was the suspicion I had that it was drugs

512
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,220
because some of the heavy equipment industry

513
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,460
that I do deal with, they have containers that do that

514
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,740
for like vegetation or for like food or for equipment

515
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,540
that needs to be chilled, wherever it might be.

516
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,780
So I'm like, okay, I think it's drugs.

517
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,940
So they drive these trucks onto this platform here,

518
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,740
which is you can see like when the trucks are going up

519
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,980
that the trucks were getting smaller,

520
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,140
which was able to kind of gauge the size a little bit.

521
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,780
And then they were loading it on.

522
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,860
I mean, I don't see how they,

523
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,860
I didn't see how they actually took the trailers off.

524
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,860
They drove onto this platform that like seemingly levitates

525
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,180
and it didn't make any noise.

526
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,300
It didn't make any noise.

527
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,500
You said it makes like almost like a base.

528
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,420
Like the whole thing itself did the whole time.

529
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,260
And it's something that's so different

530
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,500
that if somebody was to recreate it accurately,

531
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,460
like Joey kind of did the same thing,

532
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,740
which was very similar.

533
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,580
Correct.

534
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,420
And it was something like that

535
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,460
because it wasn't a traditional propulsion system

536
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,780
by any means, it's not like a rotor inside something.

537
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,980
And so you got photos of the craft.

538
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,820
Yes, I did.

539
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,340
I took video and photos.

540
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,020
When we were on top of that hill

541
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,500
is when I took photos of this thing

542
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,420
and it was obscured by some vegetation.

543
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,580
And that's what caught our eye

544
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,660
because it was something that was very abstract

545
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,820
from the rest of the environment is changing colors.

546
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,820
It was like, is it a building?

547
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,420
What the hell's going on?

548
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,740
And I wasn't the one who made the decision

549
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,020
to go down there to go find out.

550
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,060
And when you were on top of the hill,

551
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,820
you couldn't see the trucks or the operators.

552
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,660
Nothing.

553
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,500
Couldn't see people.

554
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,700
Because like I said, it's very dense jungle,

555
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,820
very thick vegetation.

556
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,860
There's some clearings, of course.

557
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,540
There's some, what I can remember at least,

558
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,420
which mainly was a vegetation.

559
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,780
I can't tell you if there's mountains or hills or anything,

560
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,740
which I remember there being hills, of course,

561
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,420
when we were flying, it could kind of peek out.

562
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,220
But other than that, I don't know exactly where we went

563
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,700
or where we landed to or anything like that.

564
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,380
And I know there's been people that I've been trying

565
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,020
that I've asked for help to see if they could find the LZs

566
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,900
and to no avail, they can't

567
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,900
because there's no information on them.

568
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,020
And the F-350s or Tundras or whatever these trucks are,

569
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,380
they're attached to, it's like containers with HVACs?

570
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,220
Yeah, they're, yeah.

571
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,540
What do the containers look like?

572
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,500
So it's like a kind of like a shipping container

573
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,620
a little bit, but a little bit more reinforced

574
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,020
if you want to call it that.

575
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,820
And that's what I hypothesized it was drugs.

576
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,580
It was just like, you know.

577
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,540
And so it also had things that are like Pelican casings

578
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,660
on the back of the actual truck beds themselves.

579
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,740
So there could be weapons,

580
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,460
there could be other things in those things

581
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,700
because they're very airtight

582
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,820
and they seal up from moisture pretty well.

583
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,380
So it keeps everything dry.

584
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,900
So yeah, it could have been weapons.

585
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,980
It could have been anything,

586
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,260
but we mainly would put weapons in those.

587
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,780
So I'm assuming they did the same thing too.

588
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,660
And so when we saw the last trucks go up

589
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,500
is basically when this whole thing happened

590
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,700
with the platform raising up

591
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,020
and then the craft lowered itself

592
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,220
and then it went over the tree line

593
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,860
because it was like literally on the ground

594
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,020
or not on the ground, but it was hovering on the ground

595
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,380
but it was low enough that it was actually lower

596
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,860
than the treetops.

597
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,820
So this thing rose up past the treetops

598
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,180
and then it shut off to the left.

599
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,580
But prior to doing that, because it's rotating

600
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,180
and it was rotating in a clockwise motion.

601
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,820
So you can start seeing these lights appear

602
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,460
on the very corners of this thing

603
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,260
which were red, yellow, green and blue

604
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,260
is the only things I remember seeing.

605
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,580
And then this thing just shut off

606
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,340
and it was just like a black blur.

607
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,020
So extremely fast.

608
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,220
Extremely fast, fast enough that obviously it

609
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,620
for some reason did not disturb the vegetation around it.

610
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,020
There was coconuts in these trees

611
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,460
that could have easily fallen off with rotor wash

612
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,820
or exhaust wash from low flying aircraft.

613
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,980
That didn't happen.

614
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,940
And obviously it didn't make a sonic boom either

615
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,060
because of how fast this thing flew off.

616
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,860
So it was just like a black blur.

617
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,700
That's incredible.

618
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,740
I mean any estimates on speed or is that just really hard?

619
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,140
I mean several thousand miles an hour.

620
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,580
I've never seen anything fast like that.

621
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,940
I wanted to be a fighter pilot too.

622
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,100
So I know what aircraft and how they move

623
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,580
and I can tell you all the armament

624
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,420
that can go on these things.

625
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,420
And this was never something that I ever would

626
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,260
think I would ever experience.

627
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,020
Did it shoot off inland or towards the ocean?

628
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,860
Towards the ocean.

629
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,780
And any sort of ruffling of the treetops?

630
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,620
Nothing.

631
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,820
It almost like felt like it was.

632
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,540
It was almost like it was on set.

633
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,380
Like its own environment.

634
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,940
Nothing that could react to what our environment was.

635
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,620
And so this is important I think to tell the audience.

636
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,700
Like ETs are never mentioned in the context.

637
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,100
The core details of this story

638
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,620
have nothing to do with extraterrestrials.

639
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,980
And did you have a first instinct

640
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,420
on whether this was man made or not of this earth or?

641
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,260
Two things.

642
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,340
Prior to that I didn't believe in the subject

643
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,780
and I ridiculed a hell of a lot of people for it.

644
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,340
It was like you guys are fucking crazy.

645
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,740
They make movies great.

646
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,860
Of course the movies they come out

647
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,260
are all fucking terrifying and shit.

648
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,180
So it's like you can imagine a xenomorph

649
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,380
or that exists and what it would do here.

650
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,340
Or the thing from John Carpenter's

651
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,380
and something like that.

652
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,780
I mean fuck that shit.

653
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,140
But you know.

654
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,540
Did you ever encounter it in military context before this?

655
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,380
No.

656
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,220
Yeah okay.

657
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,340
So like literally zero context.

658
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,660
Zero context and it was one of those things.

659
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,020
So I didn't believe in it.

660
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,580
I never saw anything like that.

661
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,820
Did you ever suspect we had aviation technology

662
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,660
that was that advanced?

663
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,940
I mean I've heard about it like the Aurora for example

664
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,700
which was something that was hypothesized

665
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,180
which is very interesting.

666
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,020
But it's just like spy planes like that

667
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,980
but nothing anti-gravitic or anything.

668
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,860
And then you know so that day confirmed

669
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,020
that we had this technology because it was man made.

670
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,460
You could clearly tell it was man made.

671
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,300
It wasn't like ET.

672
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,580
And then some of the stuff I've seen recently

673
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,500
with ET craft photos or you know even doing CE5

674
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,140
with Greer and a couple of other people

675
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,900
and you can kind of see that it was

676
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,180
nothing you could really describe.

677
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,460
It was just like an orb or it was just like something

678
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,740
like a very bright light but it was very pure.

679
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,100
It wasn't like a drone where you could see

680
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,860
like you know blinking lights or nothing

681
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,900
but it was just a very, very pure light.

682
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,340
That's extremely important for the audience as well

683
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,700
where like whatever the ET stuff

684
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,380
and we don't even know if that's extraterrestrial

685
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,500
but it doesn't seem to be like prosaic nuts and bolts

686
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,340
like we're building it.

687
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,180
No, it's not.

688
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,980
That stuff, I don't know.

689
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,100
It looks at most like a plasma orb

690
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,780
if you had to like you know compare it

691
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,820
to something that is man made.

692
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,340
And it's often extremely ephemeral,

693
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,700
weakly entangled with that.

694
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,180
Maybe there is some sort of sensor pickup

695
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,820
but things like this where you see a thing

696
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,260
sort of hovering there, fly off, people interacting with it.

697
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,140
I mean that seems mostly of the man made variety.

698
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,660
Why would ET be trying to help out these guys?

699
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,060
Out of anybody, you know?

700
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,700
That's kind of the thing that I repeatedly say

701
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,940
because it's like no, 100% was man made.

702
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,380
Based off of that, I can confidently tell you

703
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,180
and I know for a fact recently

704
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,700
throughout the last almost two years,

705
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,900
I know for a fact we have reverse engineered technologies

706
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,460
and that's where the big secret is

707
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,860
is because they don't want people to know that

708
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,500
because then they have to explain to the whole world

709
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,180
and why we're still on fossil fuels,

710
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,220
why are we still having to depend on oil

711
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,940
and gas for our vehicles or even medical technology being

712
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,740
is it could be further advanced,

713
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,460
which I've been exposed to.

714
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,980
And everybody gets confused to think that Jake's team

715
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,620
has access to this technology.

716
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,500
It's like, no, this was somebody else

717
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,140
that was in the programs that was on a geneticist level

718
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,540
that was dealing with this kind of stuff

719
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,740
that has this technology.

720
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,060
I'm even hearing this

721
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,020
because I've heard you on a couple of podcasts,

722
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,940
Gerbs and Sean Ryan's,

723
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,260
and I think maybe the most overlooked detail

724
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,580
is the mission itself.

725
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,660
It feels weird.

726
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,500
It does.

727
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,340
It's like, okay, Obama's family is mentioned.

728
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,180
You don't have comms.

729
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,580
Do you ever think you were sort of set up

730
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,780
or there was something around the mission itself

731
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,780
that was a little funky?

732
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,500
It could be entirely possible.

733
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,340
I don't know.

734
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,060
I wasn't planning this mission

735
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,300
or planning anything like that.

736
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,140
I don't know.

737
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,900
It's very odd and it's very weird.

738
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,300
It's not typical,

739
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,780
but again, this is the first experience

740
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,740
of going on a first mission since I was freshly in

741
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,580
at that time.

742
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,100
So that was the first mission I ever did.

743
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,500
So it's like, okay, it's kind of like

744
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
just put together really quick.

745
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,340
That's what it felt like.

746
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,940
Because I think this is important to touch on too.

747
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,660
This wasn't with your normal fire.

748
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,580
No, it was not.

749
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,500
Your squad leader, your fire team leader

750
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,900
has spoken out against you before on public,

751
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,180
but this wasn't with your team.

752
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,020
No, it was not.

753
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,780
And this wasn't a special mission.

754
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,620
No, there's no secret mission with this.

755
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,620
This is basically almost like a working party.

756
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,740
And it was good because we just wanted to get off the ship.

757
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,420
And that's all it resulted.

758
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,780
So yeah, if we do LZ security or loading up boxes,

759
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,060
well, yeah, it's better than being cramped up on a ship.

760
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,260
Do you ever think,

761
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,420
because later Jake Barber back channeled with you,

762
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,380
and I think he dealt with the transport

763
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,580
of high value targets.

764
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,420
He did.

765
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,020
And so do you ever think that maybe this

766
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,460
actually had something to do with Obama's

767
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,580
Indonesian long lost family,

768
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,420
and they were actually being transported

769
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,340
on these conditions?

770
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,580
I don't think so because when,

771
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,220
so now that everybody understands the mission

772
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,660
at least with what we encountered,

773
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,420
now I can kind of go into talk about how I met Jake.

774
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,260
Yeah.

775
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,100
Okay.

776
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,420
Real quick, before we get into that,

777
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,740
what happened to the photos?

778
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,540
Okay, so good question.

779
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,380
So what happened was we ended up going back to Subic Bay

780
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,260
after that whole, you know, the mission,

781
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,420
we ended up getting ship, going back to the Philippines,

782
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,620
basically regrouping for the rest of the fleet.

783
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,580
We pull into Subic Bay.

784
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,620
So we have like, I think four or five days of liberty there.

785
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,500
So I had my camera.

786
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,020
So, you know, which these guys also had their phones,

787
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,460
which I don't think they took them with them.

788
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,300
They may have, I don't remember,

789
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,700
but I had my locker secured when we were going out into town

790
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,060
and we were supposed to report back, excuse me,

791
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,020
at nighttime, right before, you know,

792
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,420
I think 10 o'clock is when we had to be,

793
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,340
or 11 o'clock, I can't remember.

794
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,260
But ended up going back that night,

795
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,900
the first night we were out,

796
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,660
and then I go into my locker.

797
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,180
And so of course there's nothing,

798
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,500
there's the cameras out in there and I look at my rack

799
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,300
and then there it is, because I had the top rack.

800
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,380
And there it is and the battery is missing

801
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,220
and the memory card's missing.

802
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,860
So I had another battery in my locker.

803
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,220
So I went and got that, popped it in,

804
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,140
tried to turn it on and it wouldn't work.

805
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,060
So I threw it away.

806
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,780
The other guys that were with me were missing their phones

807
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,580
and some other stuff that they had.

808
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,180
And that's to remember what I can remember,

809
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,780
at least with one of the guys was there.

810
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,740
But that was very weird

811
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,940
because who else would have access to that?

812
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,820
And the lock was not broken.

813
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,620
So I don't know how they jimmied open that locker

814
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,140
with that lock on it unless they popped it somehow

815
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,940
and took that camera out because that camera was secured.

816
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,220
And then I get back and there it is.

817
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,620
Just completely disheveled and you can't turn it on.

818
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,580
It doesn't work anymore.

819
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,140
So there goes the evidence of that.

820
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,620
So somebody knew what was going on.

821
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,700
And then obviously this Air Force Lieutenant Colonel,

822
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,780
if that's really who it was,

823
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,300
but if somebody is, they had an Air Force

824
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,140
dress blue uniform with ribbons, a shitload of them.

825
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,500
They had jump wings.

826
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,460
They didn't have no pilot badge or nothing like that.

827
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,500
Then they had Lieutenant Colonel Insignia,

828
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,460
which is a silver oak leaf.

829
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,420
And he was at the CP and basically threatened me.

830
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,660
What's CP for the audio?

831
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,460
Control point, or command post, sorry, not control point.

832
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,420
So it's a command post.

833
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,300
And this was back when we were in Camp Hanson.

834
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,020
And so there was nobody there.

835
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,460
So this is back stateside?

836
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,620
No, no, no, this was in Japan or Okinawa,

837
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,900
Okinawa, which is Japan, but still.

838
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,260
So when that happened, so it happened to all of us,

839
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,500
but it wasn't at the same time.

840
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,420
And that's basically when he had made a sign in NDA saying,

841
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,460
you weren't gonna talk about this.

842
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,180
The only things I remember on it were TSSCI,

843
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,300
and Indonesia were the only thing.

844
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,180
So I remember putting my social security number on there.

845
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,220
I remember putting my first and last name or middle name too.

846
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,220
And then he told me flat out that if you talk about this,

847
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,660
you can go to prison or you can be executed over it.

848
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,340
Shh.

849
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,740
Fellow alchemists, it's a new year,

850
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,860
and that means it's time to get organized

851
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,740
and take control of our financial wellness.

852
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,940
For me, Rocket Money has been an absolute game changer.

853
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,260
It helped me uncover all sorts of subscriptions

854
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,940
I totally forgot about.

855
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,860
Like a few, I had no idea I was paying for months

856
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,940
after I stopped using the services.

857
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,180
With Rocket Money, I canceled these in just a few clicks,

858
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,020
saving money instantly.

859
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,460
Rocket Money is a personal finance app

860
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,740

00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,300

862

00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,140

You know exactly where your money is going.

865
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,860

track your monthly spending trends,

872
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,900
and even set goals to save automatically

873
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,220
for big purchases, paying off debt,

874
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,580
or just building your savings.

875
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,900
It makes staying on top of your finances

876
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,900
easy and stress-free.

877
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,500

Go to rocketmoney.com slash Jesse today.

00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,300
That's rocketmoney.com slash Jesse.

886
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,220
So it was a scare tactic because the thing is,

887
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,540
even people in the government I talked to on this,

888
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,060
Senate Armed Services, for example,

889
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,660
there's no protocols that would allow

890
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,740
for something like that to happen

891
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,860
unless you were working on a program.

892
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,820
So I don't know whether this was just a scare tactic

893
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,060
to basically just say,

894
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,940
hey guys, we haven't forgotten about you.

895
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,460
Also for the audience's sake,

896
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,180
I do think it's important to say,

897
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,820
you haven't made any money

898
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,340
off of coming out with this story.

899
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,980
And in fact, I know this about you

900
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,740
and I know you know this, Gurb, too.

901
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,260
You have a pretty successful business

902
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
out here in Colorado.

903
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,100
Multiple companies.

904
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,420
Yeah, multiple companies.

905
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,900
And so if anything, you're sort of losing money.

906
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,740
I mean, I don't know.

907
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,100
I've had the, you know, I have Rolexes.

908
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,020
That's one thing I collect.

909
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,060
That's another business that I do with, you know,

910
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,740
obtaining watches and trading them up or selling them.

911
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,780
You know, it's a good side hustle

912
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,420
if you can find the right buyers, of course.

913
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,700
But, you know, it's one of those things that

914
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,940
I have to grind to make money

915
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,060
and the best way to do it is with my companies.

916
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,980
You know, this doesn't,

917
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,780
I'm not getting paid to be here today.

918
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,980
I don't get paid for interviews.

919
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,620
I don't get paid to go have meetings at Cap Hill

920
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,820
or anything like that.

921
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,420
I sure as hell don't get paid to go attend

922
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,140
Greer's events to either, you know,

923
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,220
speak at some of them

924
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,300
because something may be valuable.

925
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,460
And that's kind of the thing that, you know,

926
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,700
I wish I was making more money

927
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,260
because who the hell wouldn't want to make more money,

928
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,540
but this isn't the path to do it.

929
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,980
So the thing that I tell people is just like,

930
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,620
you know, you'll know people by their deeds.

931
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,020
You know people based off their actions and what they do.

932
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,860
And what I'm trying to do

933
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,900
is basically solve this problem we've got.

934
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,260
I remember hearing your story

935
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,700
around that National Press Club event.

936
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,900
And my first reaction is,

937
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,180
this is the weirdest of all the testimonies.

938
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,500
And so I didn't know what to make of it.

939
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,380
And then my second like meta-reaction is like,

940
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,900
maybe it's the most likely to be legit

941
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,140
because it is so not like a script you would write.

942
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,500
Like, it's so weird.

943
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,340
It is.

944
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,060
There's so many loose ends

945
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,460
where of course you're signing up

946
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,140
to get accused of all sorts of bullshit,

947
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,260
you know, by just telling the story.

948
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,180
All of us who are going through this get accused of it.

949
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,020
It's nothing new.

950
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,860
I don't pay attention to it.

951
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,860
I don't care what anybody says.

952
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,700
Yeah.

953
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,520
Doesn't do anything.

954
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,360
They're not paying my bills.

955
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,620
I mean, this is the problem with people these days

956
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,060
is they put too much validation into people

957
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,220
who realistically hate to say it this way,

958
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,180
but don't matter.

959
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,660
Why am I going to care what a cab driver or a bouncer

960
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,260
or some random person walking on the street

961
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,620
that I have no idea exists until just seeing them,

962
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,940
why am I going to put more emphasis on what they care about?

963
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,620
Or because somebody says something on Twitter

964
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,100
who is hiding behind a ghost account

965
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,140
or like, I'm not going to put effort into that.

966
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,260
I put effort into what I'm doing as best as I can,

967
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,580
which business is my first thing.

968
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,460
That's my livelihood.

969
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,820
That's how I make money.

970
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,900
And I've lost contracts.

971
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,900
I've lost business because I've came forward.

972
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,740
So if anything, it has hurt me.

973
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,580
Yeah.

974
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,740
So you come back to the US

975
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,420
and this is what, 2009, 2010?

976
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,900
2009, yeah.

977
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,300
So probably 2009.

978
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,780
And then, yeah, getting back probably 2010, early.

979
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,820
How long do you stay silent on the topic

980
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,980
and what convinces you to go public?

981
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,100
So at the time, like I talked about meeting Greer in 2018,

982
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,400
I kind of hinted around that.

983
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,940
My ex I was with at the time,

984
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,100
I told her a little bit of the reason

985
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,000
why I was wanting to approach Greer.

986
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,580
And then, so she kind of heard a little bit of it,

987
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,980
but then when I came forward fully

988
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,980
through Greer's press club event,

989
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,660
but also he had a two-day event before that too.

990
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,600
This is where Jake was basically, where I'd met Jake,

991
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,660
but I didn't know it was him, if that makes sense.

992
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,220
He introduced himself, but I had no idea

993
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,020
it was this gentleman.

994
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,340
And so he, I mean, he's, you know.

995
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,820
So that was the first time you had ever come out

996
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,580
was this national press club event with Greer.

997
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,500
And you can add color to this as well,

998
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,300
because I know you know a lot about Stephen Greer.

999
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,940
He had held a similar national press club event

1000
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,660
like two decades earlier or something.

1001
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,060
Yeah, this was in 2001

1002
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,700
and he hosted a panel of whistleblowers

1003
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,900
and it's an excellent video.

1004
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,780
I'll draw attention to Mark McCandlish

1005
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,420
and the alien reproduction vehicle flux liner

1006
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,300
we talked about.

1007
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,980
It featured individuals such as I think Donna Hare

1008
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,780
from NASA who talked about NASA scrubbing UAP photos.

1009
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,020
And he also had an accompanying

1010
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,860
2001 disclosure briefing document,

1011
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,620
which is an excellent piece

1012
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,540
and features so much whistleblower testimony.

1013
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,340
So this was kind of the first time

1014
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,860
he did a symposium like that since 01.

1015
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:07,860
And just also broadly, Stephen Greer was the guy

1016
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,580
over the last three decades,

1017
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,420
if you were gonna come out and say anything on this topic,

1018
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,900
he was kind of the only game in town in many ways.

1019
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,980
And there are other researchers

1020
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,020
that you like to talk about,

1021
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,900
Bill Hamilton and others prior to Greer

1022
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,100
who've set a lot of the foundation for what he talks about.

1023
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,900
But he was kind of the guy for somebody like Michael

1024
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,660
with his experience to come to.

1025
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,580
Not only that, but there was a long period of time

1026
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,580
which may continue today

1027
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,300
where researchers give Greer witnesses.

1028
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,500
And so researchers say, these are witnesses,

1029
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,620
this is their name, number, and background.

1030
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:43,340
And one example is Bill Hamilton giving primary witness

1031
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,860
Brad Ass to Greer back in 97.

1032
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,540
So he's doing a more modern version

1033
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,060
of this National Press Club event.

1034
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,700
You're speaking at this event.

1035
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,300
Jake Barber, who's recently come out,

1036
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,340
again, this Air Force vet who claims firsthand retrieval,

1037
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,540
is there, but he's there trying to infiltrate Greer

1038
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,060
on behalf of legacy UFO programs.

1039
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,220
And so what happens?

1040
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,740
Well, you know, so it's interesting.

1041
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:10,020
So I wake up to this message from Greer one morning

1042
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,340
and he sent it to me like two o'clock in the morning

1043
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,540
because he stays up pretty late.

1044
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,460
You know, he tries to be,

1045
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,660
he lives in obviously the East Coast

1046
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,260
and then he's like, lives off a West Coast time

1047
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,460
which is odd, but that's his schedule.

1048
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,340
So I go to bed pretty early

1049
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,180
when I don't have anything pressing

1050
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,260
because I like to get my rest.

1051
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,300
And then the next day, I mean,

1052
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,740
my days are usually crazy as it is,

1053
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,500
but so I wake up this message and it's literally,

1054
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,020
hey, this gentleman, you know,

1055
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,660
I'm not going to say the alias that he was using

1056
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,900
because I don't want that to be out

1057
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,900
because then all of a sudden it'll just,

1058
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,420
good to create problems.

1059
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,700
If Jake wants to speak about that,

1060
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,340
then Jake can speak about it on his own accord,

1061
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,940
but I don't want to put anything in front of him

1062
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,180
that he doesn't need to be concerned with.

1063
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,180
So he says, this gentleman knows what you saw,

1064
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,780
but here's his contact information,

1065
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,620
get ahold of him when you can.

1066
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,540
So I'm like, oh shit.

1067
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,740
So I sit on that for like a day and a half.

1068
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,220
I'm just thinking like, what should I do?

1069
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,580
Should I just blow it off or?

1070
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,900
So I get in touch with him.

1071
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,820
So I call him, no voicemail can be sent

1072
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,500
or anything like that.

1073
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,900
So I'm in text message.

1074
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,340
So all of a sudden he kind of goes off

1075
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,100
a little bit in detail.

1076
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:23,980
Wanted me to come out West to meet with him face to face

1077
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,300
and he can explain what it is that I saw,

1078
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,500
what he knows about it.

1079
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:33,220
I said, they'll take my security into consideration.

1080
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,300
So, cause we got picked,

1081
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,860
I got picked up in a armored vehicle,

1082
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,580
which was pretty bad ass.

1083
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,260
And this was after you had met him

1084
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,620
at the national press club,

1085
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,780
after you had-

1086
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,500
Yeah, I was introduced to him,

1087
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
but I wasn't introduced to him

1088
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,460
as the guy who knew what I experienced.

1089
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,420
So you had met him,

1090
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,500
but you didn't connect the dots

1091
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,620
that that was this guy who Greer was talking about,

1092
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,540
who knew a little bit more about what you had experienced.

1093
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,380
Okay, I got it.

1094
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,740
So, you know, and the thing-

1095
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,980
Do you remember that interaction though

1096
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,820
at the national press club?

1097
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,660
Oh yeah, like I told him a little bit

1098
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,220
what I do business wise and all that.

1099
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,580
So he's kind of asking me questions,

1100
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,580
but you know, he looked like,

1101
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,020
I mean, cause everybody's seen what he looks like

1102
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,140
when he wears glasses and he's wearing like this suit jacket

1103
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,220
and the kind of stuff like that.

1104
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,740
He kind of looked like a geek a little bit,

1105
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,580
you know what I mean?

1106
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,860
So he's like, okay, this guy, you know,

1107
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,020
this guy's just probably something that I'm with this,

1108
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,420
but here's a former tier one operator

1109
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,740
that's, you know, a bad-ass guy that,

1110
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,420
I mean, I wouldn't double cross that guy.

1111
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,500
He's just, the guy's a,

1112
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,780
him and his team are very good people, very good guys.

1113
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,540
So, so he talks about the security aspect of it,

1114
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,340
which he'll pick me up in an armored vehicle,

1115
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,620
which was pretty cool.

1116
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,980
And so we were trying to negotiate when I can fly out.

1117
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,180
So we got a time scheduled.

1118
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,100
So I ended up booking the flights and telling them,

1119
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,180
this is when I'll arrive.

1120
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,180
And, you know, basically asking him,

1121
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,860
where should I fly in and where do I, you know, fly back?

1122
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,860
So he had told me basically how to set all that up.

1123
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,700
And then he had transportation waiting for me.

1124
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,140
So he gave me this gentleman's number.

1125
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,300
And so they picked me up.

1126
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:07,540
And we drive from the airport to another location.

1127
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,900
And we go to this pretty cool place

1128
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,820
and where Jake was at, like an office.

1129
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,660
Okay.

1130
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,500
And-

1131
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,340
Where are you?

1132
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,100
Well, I'm just going to say it's in California.

1133
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,940
Okay.

1134
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,500
But that's all I'm going to say, right?

1135
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,340
I'm not going to give specifics to where this location was,

1136
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,660
which is hard to do because, I mean,

1137
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,540
there's people who research this and by all means research

1138
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,380
that figure it out.

1139
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,620
You're going to find some interesting stuff.

1140
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,420
So we go to this particular place in California

1141
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,220
and he's, so he introduces himself again

1142
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,140
as this alias, right?

1143
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,660
And so he ends up sending a driver to go get us lunch,

1144
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,500
which was cool.

1145
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,620
And so he ended up knowing what I wanted, which was weird,

1146
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,260
but that's on a separate tangent.

1147
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,220
He knew what you wanted food-wise.

1148
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,060
This gentleman did because I told him I wanted some Subway

1149
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,020
because I haven't had that in a while.

1150
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,500
But he knew the exact order that was your favorite order

1151
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,340
or something?

1152
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,460
Okay.

1153
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,340
So they had like a little dossier on you or something?

1154
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,980
I don't know if that's what the case was

1155
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,820
or this guy was.

1156
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,140
What would make sense in the context of Jake even saying

1157
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,860
that his initial role was to red team

1158
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,260
or infiltrate through his campaign.

1159
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,780
And I mean, it's speculation, of course.

1160
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,100
He told me personally that what his role was

1161
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,020
after the fact of getting to know him

1162
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,740
and getting information from him

1163
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,540
for almost the past couple of years.

1164
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,820
But this guy that was with him was a very good person,

1165
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,100
very good guy.

1166
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,380
And I mean, everybody that I'd known through Jake

1167
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,940
was a great person.

1168
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,540
So we ended up going into this office building

1169
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,780
or not really an office building,

1170
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,940
just like an office, like a conference room.

1171
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,580
So we sit down, he tells me, okay,

1172
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,460
go ahead and take out your phone and put on airplane mode

1173
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,260
and set it off on the side.

1174
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,340
So I do that.

1175
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,780
And then actually prior to that,

1176
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,780
he pulls out this wand thing.

1177
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,180
It's like this box with this loop.

1178
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,700
And he says, so he went over it himself and was like,

1179
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,740
go ahead and take it and do it to yourself.

1180
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,020
We heard the beeper go off on that wand

1181
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,060
because it went over the phone and it reacted.

1182
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,140
So he's like, oh yeah, go ahead

1183
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,660
and put on airplane mode and do that.

1184
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,740
So he's making sure it wasn't chipped

1185
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,780
or had any kind of listening devices

1186
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:23,020
or something like a wire, for example.

1187
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,060
So then we sit at this conference room table

1188
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,740
and he's explaining to me what it was.

1189
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,060
He explained the containers, he explained the program P3,

1190
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,620
which P3 is not the real program designation,

1191
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,700
it's just what they call it.

1192
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,260
Which was a psionic potential predisposition.

1193
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,100
Okay.

1194
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,460
And so, yeah, what?

1195
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,620
Which, I mean, it sounds very far out there,

1196
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,420
but being in these shoes for the last almost two years

1197
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,380
and understanding that consciousness

1198
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,020
is really the key to this whole thing.

1199
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,100
If you want to understand how these UFOs operate,

1200
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,900
you need to understand the consciousness better.

1201
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,380
And so who, yeah, what was in these containers?

1202
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,140
Because he thought initially it might've been drugs.

1203
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:04,980
I thought it was drugs

1204
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,740
and he has said I was completely wrong about that.

1205
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,700
And what is he telling you?

1206
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,140
He's saying it is basically these people

1207
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,020
who are psionic assets who have been screened

1208
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,020
from third world countries that they use them.

1209
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,860
Because there's different groups that are recruited

1210
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,380
out of the United States to participate

1211
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,100
in different parts of the world.

1212
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,940
And explain what a psionic asset is.

1213
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,500
These are people that are,

1214
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,260
they have a psychic ability to an extent,

1215
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,340
to my understanding,

1216
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,980
and they use these people to basically hook up

1217
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,260
to this advanced technology,

1218
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,900
whether it's NHI technology, ET craft, if you will,

1219
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,220
and basically either summon them

1220
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,740
or call them in and invite them in.

1221
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:48,340
And then the dark part about this whole thing,

1222
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,020
because everybody started getting wrapped up

1223
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,420
in the human trafficking.

1224
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,940
That got slapped onto it.

1225
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,100
Now understanding how the dynamic is now

1226
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,180
where these people volunteer for this kind of work,

1227
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,780
because one, it's, if you hadn't,

1228
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,500
I know if you guys had the opportunity

1229
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,100
to participate in something that was mind blowing

1230
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,220
with this technology, would you guys accept it?

1231
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,940
I'd be, I'd want to know more.

1232
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,780
I'd be cautious.

1233
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,620
What about you?

1234
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,980
Be cautious, but if it was in a sense

1235
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:18,820
where you're participating,

1236
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,660
because everybody's like, oh,

1237
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,220
these people are dying and all that,

1238
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,260
well, why aren't you complaining

1239
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,020
about people going to the military?

1240
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,740
Because you're taking risks going to the military too,

1241
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,700
where you could die.

1242
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,580
Or hey, you want to drive a race car for a living,

1243
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,580
you happen to crash, well, that kills you,

1244
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,860
you play professional sports,

1245
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,500
you could always get screwed up.

1246
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,020
You know, when I did competitive bodybuilding,

1247
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,140
people talk about the risk of being

1248
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,020
on performance enhancing drugs.

1249
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,980
Well, let's even just super basically for the audience.

1250
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,700
So these psionic assets are,

1251
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,700
what are they doing vis-a-vis UFOs?

1252
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,060
They are basically getting into a cognitive

1253
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,860
or a state of consciousness to attract these craft

1254
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,860
to appear at these certain ranges in this organization,

1255
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,060
not Jake's team.

1256
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,420
So everybody needs to understand

1257
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,180
that Jake's team is completely different

1258
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,740
from what this organization does.

1259
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,380
And this organization will then sometimes target them

1260
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,420
with these EMP weapon systems, their scaler,

1261
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,260
and they knock them out of the sky.

1262
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,260
So you're sort of baiting the UFOs to come in

1263
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,100
and then you're knocking them out of the sky.

1264
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,740
That's where Jake's team would come into need

1265
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,620
is because his team would get contracted

1266
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,180
to go pick up these vehicles

1267
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,500
and then transfer them to a facility.

1268
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,780
Okay, so you speak at the MPC,

1269
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,420
you're then contacted by Jake

1270
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,420
and you're then taken to a location.

1271
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,140
Now what about the other five Marines

1272
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,740
that experienced the eight gone possibly

1273
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,740
reverse engineered craft with you?

1274
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,980
What have they said?

1275
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,740
Because I'd have known, but I wanna take that off.

1276
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,020
Only two of them have reached out after the fact.

1277
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,980
The other three have not.

1278
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,260
And I don't think they're going to,

1279
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,140
and I frankly don't think they ever want any part of this.

1280
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,860
Now you, I can attest to this,

1281
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,180
what have you personally seen?

1282
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,380
Because I've shared some communication with two of them.

1283
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,740
What did you see them do?

1284
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,940
Yeah, both from communications,

1285
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,900
like between you and them that you've showed me

1286
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,900
as well as Joey trying to speak

1287
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,740
to these two specific Marines.

1288
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,980
They always, every single time say, leave me out of it.

1289
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,980
I don't wanna talk about it,

1290
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,980
but never once have they denied it.

1291
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,620
You've offered to actually show us some of these texts

1292
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,740
while obviously removing any personally identifying

1293
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,380
information with your communications

1294
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,340
with one of these Marines.

1295
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,700
You saw the unredacted before, right?

1296
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,540
Yeah.

1297
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,380
To make sure you did too.

1298
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,620
So you know the names, you guys have seen them.

1299
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,820
Yes, we've seen the names and yes, yeah.

1300
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,300
Fellow alchemists, Lucy breakers are changing the game

1301
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,380
for nicotine users.

1302
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,580
If you're looking for 100% pure nicotine product

1303
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:45,220
that's tobacco free, Lucy breakers are where it's at.

1304
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,060
Each pouch has a cool twist.

1305
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,700
Inside is a capsule that can pop to release

1306
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,820
an extra burst of flavor and hydration.

1307
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,180
It's a unique experience that makes your nicotine routine

1308
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,180
more enjoyable and convenient.

1309
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,540
As someone who delves into the most heretical thinkers

1310
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,460
and ideas of our time,

1311
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,260
I appreciate products that challenge the norm.

1312
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,460
Lucy breakers do just that.

1313
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,980
My personal go-to flavor is mint.

1314
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:12,100
Whether I'm deep into a podcast discussion,

1315
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,180
exploring new frontiers or brainstorming ideas,

1316
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,700
throwing in a Lucy is an easy way to keep the day moving.

1317
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,380
Plus the flexibility and strengths lets you choose

1318
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,860
what suits you best.

1319
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,700
Let's level up your nicotine routine with Lucy.

1320
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,900
Go to lucy.co slash Jesse and use promo code Jesse

1321
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,460
to get 20% off your first order.

1322
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,020
Lucy has a 30 day refund policy if you change your mind.

1323
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,140
Again, that's lucy.co and use code Jesse to get 20% off.

1324
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,620
And here comes the fine print.

1325
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,420
Lucy products are only for adults of legal age.

1326
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,400
Every order is age verified.

1327
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,020
Warning, this product contains nicotine.

1328
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,220
Nicotine is an addictive chemical.

1329
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,380
Thanks so much to Lucy for sponsoring today's episode.

1330
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,780
Okay, so this is, which side is you, Michael?

1331
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,100
Okay, so I'm the light pink text

1332
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,900
and this guy is the purple text, right?

1333
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,860
Okay, so he says, sounds good, bud.

1334
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,460
Says, hey man, this is asking too much of me

1335
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,120
and it's not worth the risk.

1336
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,980
And this is presumably after a phone call you got a sign.

1337
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,860
I gave him a phone call from when I was instructed

1338
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,500
by some people in the Senate Intel,

1339
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,460
try to get ahold of him to see

1340
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,540
if he wants to actually talk to us.

1341
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,660
Okay, so you just spoke, you asked him to come out.

1342
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,320
He said, hey, this is asking too much of me

1343
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,920
and it's not worth the risk.

1344
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,640
My family and military career far exceed

1345
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,320
anything you are asking of me.

1346
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,960
It's not worth my life or jeopardizing my family.

1347
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,480
You need to get out of whatever you are in

1348
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,280
and don't get me involved.

1349
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,120
Presumably it's a-

1350
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,800
Yeah, I can't view it because it's a screenshot.

1351
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,200
But he basically after that says,

1352
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,360
don't ever ask me to do this shit ever again.

1353
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,480
That's what he said the last part, right?

1354
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,560
This was another guy that reached out to me

1355
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,880
through LinkedIn after he saw my Sean Ryan appearance.

1356
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,720
And again, Gerb and I both have seen the names.

1357
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,480
But squad mate, right?

1358
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,840
So what the fuck else does that mean?

1359
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,120
Saw your interview, my email is blank, right?

1360
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,640
So I sent him a message to check your email.

1361
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,280
Sends this over.

1362
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,600
So what's up, buddy, how are you doing?

1363
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,720
He says, I'm doing good, brother.

1364
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,120
Saw that you're getting the word out, mad respect.

1365
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,200
He said, it means a lot hearing from you, brother,

1366
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,720
especially since we were close.

1367
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,240
And then he says, yeah, brother, keep the faith.

1368
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,000
There is no borders lines that they won't cross.

1369
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,320
He says, well, I have a spot for you on my team.

1370
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,080
So basically if you wanted to get involved with us

1371
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,240
trying to do this.

1372
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,960
And that's pretty much it.

1373
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,120
And you guys saw when it wasn't redacted,

1374
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,600
you guys saw the names, you guys saw that nothing was.

1375
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,760
Yep, and you said, well, I have a spot for you on my team

1376
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,680
if I go after trafficking ops.

1377
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,040
So that's the human trafficking.

1378
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,200
Yep, if that is the case,

1379
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,840
because there's some people who reached out to me,

1380
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,040
they're combating real human trafficking

1381
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,120
in Africa, South America.

1382
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,600
He's obviously trained.

1383
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,120
So if he wanted to participate in doing that kind of stuff,

1384
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,120
I got people reach out to me.

1385
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,480
Hey, you want to part of a task force?

1386
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,600
And he says at the end, sounds good, brother,

1387
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,720
keep posted, be easy, stay safe.

1388
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,560
Yep. Wow.

1389
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,840
But yeah, it says, yeah, brother, keep the faith.

1390
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,160
There are no borders nor lines that they won't cross.

1391
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,000
Yeah. Yup.

1392
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,840
And then he's going to say,

1393
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,280
it's hard that you're getting the word out.

1394
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,120
Yeah, the word.

1395
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,760
What is he talking about if he's not implying

1396
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,120
that he knows exactly what you're talking about?

1397
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,280
That's exactly it.

1398
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,960
The original Daily Mail article on you

1399
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,560
posted just a screenshot of one of the Marines.

1400
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,400
I know who it is.

1401
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,760
I'm like, leave me out of this.

1402
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,360
I have a family, I'm still in the military,

1403
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,200
something like that.

1404
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,760
Like, I don't want to speak about this.

1405
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,600
Yeah.

1406
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,800
But you've showed many further.

1407
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,520
Well, I have shown, yes.

1408
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,400
And I have reported though, or not reported,

1409
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,800
but I have provided a Senate Select Committee

1410
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,200
on Intelligence all those messages.

1411
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,440
Because why would he be afraid to help?

1412
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,840
What's the repercussions if he helps?

1413
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,720
Obviously with what we experienced.

1414
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,600
Why would the other guy be appreciative of me

1415
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,400
bringing this out, getting the word out, as he says?

1416
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,520
So what happened to the other three?

1417
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,760
Are they just completely off radar?

1418
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,280
Maybe, I don't know.

1419
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,800
I'm sure they're aware.

1420
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,760
I mean, most people are, you know?

1421
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,560
But I mean, it's up to them whether or not

1422
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,400
they choose not to.

1423
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,920
I completely understand I'm the one that jumped

1424
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,760
the gun on us.

1425
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,720
So far, they have not contributed in a sense,

1426
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,720
at least that it was able to give me the messages

1427
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,520
that they sent me that I can provide to say,

1428
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,240
what the fuck would they be talking about?

1429
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,520
If this wasn't real, they would be saying,

1430
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,200
no, what are you talking about, dude?

1431
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,280
But the fact they're not denying it,

1432
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,760
the fact that they're against it,

1433
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,320
such as they don't wanna talk about it

1434
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,440
because of the ramifications, the first clue.

1435
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,120
Second clue, why would they be acknowledging

1436
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,600
and getting the word out?

1437
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,320
The only person saying this never happened

1438
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,160
was your fire team leader, who was?

1439
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,680
I got two other Marines who say otherwise.

1440
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,480
Right, the fire team leader was not on the mission.

1441
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,280
He was not on the mission.

1442
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,160
I don't know what he was doing.

1443
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,880
If he was wild, you're in it.

1444
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,720
Sorry, go for it.

1445
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,080
Yeah, I didn't wanna get you off.

1446
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,640
But no, you know, it's just, you know,

1447
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,040
to him, they can think and believe whatever they want.

1448
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:48,880
I don't care.

1449
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,560
It doesn't ruin my mood.

1450
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,200
It doesn't do anything different.

1451
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,400
It certainly doesn't derail my mission

1452
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,280
of what I'm trying to achieve,

1453
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,520
at least with the transparency with this,

1454
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,640
to get this problem real then once and for all.

1455
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,160
It begs all these questions of like,

1456
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,520
if we're engaging in black ops in the jungle in Indonesia,

1457
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,160
and you guys just kind of happened upon this thing,

1458
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,600
how many other remote locations where, you know,

1459
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,720
you just never expect anybody,

1460
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,840
any passerby to kind of encounter this stuff,

1461
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,520
is this going on?

1462
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,400
Right.

1463
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,680
Well, I mean, like I've been told,

1464
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,680
Jake's even aware too,

1465
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,400
that there's several different sites all over the world

1466
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,240
that deal with this.

1467
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,560
And you know, Southeast Asia being one of them,

1468
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,440
third world countries, Mexico being one of them.

1469
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,880
And so, because in your Sean Ryan episode,

1470
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,800
Sean uses the term human trafficking.

1471
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,640
Correct.

1472
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,560
And so there's this big debate,

1473
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,560
because I interviewed Jake,

1474
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,400
and you know, it's just like this question of,

1475
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,160
there was, I believe it's tsunami warning at the time, right?

1476
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,320
It wasn't a tsunami warning.

1477
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,960
So the thing is, everything already happened.

1478
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,760
Oh, so this was post tsunami.

1479
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,440
This was post earthquake and tsunami.

1480
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,880
So then, were you guys,

1481
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,520
because the Sean Ryan thing, it was like,

1482
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,960
there was like, you were almost taking advantage,

1483
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,880
or the quote unquote tier one operators,

1484
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,040
whoever they were, were taking advantage of the fact

1485
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,760
that this was a disaster zone.

1486
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,520
Correct, that was a theory.

1487
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,920
That was a theory.

1488
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,920
Or it could have been that their operation

1489
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,000
was compromised somehow,

1490
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,480
and they needed to get away, or whatever it might be.

1491
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,680
I mean, it's just.

1492
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,320
Do you have a bias in either direction?

1493
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,120
Do you think they were sort of rounding people off?

1494
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,360
I'm just neutral about it,

1495
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,880
because of being in this situation,

1496
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,640
and now understanding, at least to my knowledge,

1497
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,120
of what takes place now.

1498
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:28,960
Yep.

1499
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,960
I had a negative, excuse me, outlook on it at first,

1500
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,720
because I didn't understand it.

1501
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,400
The more I talked to Jake about it,

1502
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,040
the more he was able to put it into reference

1503
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,680
on why it made sense.

1504
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,640
Now, is it something that is agreed upon?

1505
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,960
No, because they're using children,

1506
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,360
and that's bothersome.

1507
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,960
I don't know anybody who would feel good about that,

1508
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,960
because I don't have kids, but if I had kids,

1509
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,400
they were getting plucked into these programs,

1510
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,760
and being subjected to this kind of stuff,

1511
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,800
I would have a problem with that,

1512
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,400
and I think anybody in their right state of mind

1513
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,440
would have a problem with that, too.

1514
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,280
I agree.

1515
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,220
So, there's some trade-offs with this,

1516
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,080
but what people have to understand,

1517
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,960
and they vilify these legacy programs

1518
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,320
like nobody's business, like they're all bad guys.

1519
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,920
It's not the case.

1520
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,760
It's the best and brightest this country has to offer

1521
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,000
that get pulled into these programs

1522
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,040
to basically make our country better to an extent.

1523
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,800
Now, there are some breakaway parts and factions of this

1524
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,880
that take their own routes,

1525
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,880
i.e. Jake with his initiative with what he wants to do,

1526
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,320
which essentially make everybody understand

1527
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,320
that the legacy programs are not all that bad,

1528
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,800
but also have another outlet for people to pay attention to

1529
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,360
as far as making contact with other civilizations

1530
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,200
and inviting them in and basically assessing

1531
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,560
the data that they collect, which is public to an extent

1532
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,280
because this is what they're talking about doing.

1533
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,280
If you are baiting a thing that seems like

1534
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,120
it's coming from another world or planet

1535
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,560
or inter-dimensionally or whatever this is,

1536
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,160
and then zapping it out of the sky,

1537
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,400
if you know it's bad, that's fine.

1538
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,600
If you don't, shouldn't we have some caution

1539
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,600
around doing that?

1540
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,760
There should be some sort of system,

1541
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,840
diplomatic or whatever you would say,

1542
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,600
but this is the thing, as you know,

1543
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,200
if you're in the military or you're in some sort of capacity

1544
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,600
where you're taking orders,

1545
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,640
you're not really in a position to think necessarily.

1546
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,600
You're just gonna do what's instructed for you to do.

1547
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,440
And I feel the same way is probably perpetrated

1548
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,640
in people in these programs to an extent

1549
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,840
and to think the same way.

1550
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,760
This is a reason why they cross-deck into these agencies

1551
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,200
because they still have the same structure.

1552
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,840
They still have the same type of orders that are given

1553
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,120
or things like that.

1554
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,520
Yes, you're more free-thinking, but at the same time,

1555
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,920
you're also doing sort of the same work,

1556
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,760
but just in a different capacity.

1557
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,920
So if you're taking orders to say, hey, this,

1558
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,160
whatever comes into range, take them out.

1559
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,720
I don't think anybody's gonna argue with that

1560
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,360
because the amount of pay that comes with this

1561
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,000
and it's your only opportunity.

1562
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,280
And these guys get paid pretty good.

1563
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,480
Yeah, well, this isn't necessarily blaming the operators

1564
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,320
who are involved at all.

1565
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,960
No, and that's the thing is that they're told one thing

1566
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,760
because the management level of these

1567
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,920
know what's going on to an extent.

1568
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,480
And this is where it comes into either they're doing this

1569
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,040
for their own personal benefit or their gain

1570
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,000
for whatever group they control,

1571
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,200
i.e. through money, coercion of certain things.

1572
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,360
But again, this is speculation, but at the same time,

1573
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,440
the facts are is that we are shooting them down.

1574
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,560
Yes, they are facts.

1575
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,640
And regardless of everybody out there says,

1576
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,880
I've never seen this happen.

1577
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,200
Well, yeah, you're not going to.

1578
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,720
You're not a part of these programs.

1579
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,800
You're not a part of anything

1580
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,200
that's gonna get you into this

1581
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,840
because the people that are involved with this,

1582
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,680
they don't like to talk about it.

1583
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,160
They like to do the work and they do what's required of them.

1584
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,840
They get paid a lot of money to do it.

1585
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,760
And some of the work, a lot of the work that they do

1586
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,520
is probably very fun.

1587
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,320
They probably get to do things that are not normal

1588
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,200
that nobody in this room gets to say

1589
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,240
that they get to do, right?

1590
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,160
Do you think because you hear rumors of the psionic assets

1591
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,920
having sundowner syndrome or health effects or whatever,

1592
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,680
and you get, I mean, I think this goes back

1593
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,760
to ancient esoteric practices.

1594
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,120
And it's sort of this thing where if you're not

1595
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:18,280
of an extremely pure, internally coherent state,

1596
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,120
then you get a reflection of the pain that's inside of you.

1597
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,280
You're gonna manifest whatever you're projecting out there.

1598
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,440
I think that's realistic.

1599
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,120
But what we're talking about

1600
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,200
is not like trying to summon a spirit.

1601
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,840
You're summoning essentially technology

1602
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,320
that has consciousness to it.

1603
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,280
Now-

1604
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,640
What's the distinction?

1605
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,640
Well, the difference is, is obviously

1606
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,040
if they're extraterrestrial that have a consciousness,

1607
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,200
they're coming from a different star system.

1608
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,280
That's what's different.

1609
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,360
Do we know that?

1610
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,320
We don't.

1611
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,880
This is the, now they may know that

1612
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,920
based off of however they're interacting.

1613
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,080
Could this just be like an occult thing

1614
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,880
that's been coming out for hundreds of years?

1615
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,880
How do you think they learn?

1616
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,720
Who?

1617
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,800
Groups, they learn from the occult.

1618
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,640
Sure, interesting.

1619
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,640
The secrecy aspect of this is,

1620
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,520
you have different fraternities or secret societies.

1621
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,000
I mean, everybody knows I'm a Freemason.

1622
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,880
I've talked about it, but everybody speculates

1623
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,440
all because I'm a Freemason,

1624
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,160
I'm a disinformation agent or something,

1625
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,720
or I'm a part of the New World Order.

1626
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,840
And then they see the SDG pin that I wear,

1627
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,680
which everybody says it's the World Economic Forum.

1628
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,440
Sorry, I am too poor to be one of those guys

1629
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,120
and I do not fit whatever they need.

1630
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,720
I think this is an important discrepancy to bring up too.

1631
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,280
When Jake discusses Skywatchers

1632
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,640
and some people on the Skywatchers team,

1633
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,600
the P3 assets are quite engaged with what they do.

1634
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,200
They're happy, they're former military,

1635
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,880
or they're well-treated individuals.

1636
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,560
When we first did our interview in summer of 2024,

1637
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,040
what you knew at the time was that the P3 assets

1638
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,120
were essentially treated like trash,

1639
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,960
given drug cocktails to interface with the craft,

1640
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,280
treated like garbage.

1641
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,720
How does this leverage connect?

1642
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,240
So here's the thing is I think there's speculation

1643
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,760
because one of the things is because they're given drugs,

1644
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,120
doesn't necessarily mean that they're treated like trash.

1645
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,320
What it does is it allows them to operate

1646
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,360
at a higher level of consciousness,

1647
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,080
even though there's some disassociation with it,

1648
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,560
or if there's other trauma-related things

1649
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,000
that happen early on in their lives,

1650
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,280
or they induce it somehow.

1651
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,960
Granted, this is not what Jake's team does.

1652
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,840
The operators he has on this team

1653
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:29,760
do not do what these legacy programs do.

1654
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,560
It's completely different.

1655
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,720
So everybody thinks that if Skywatchers

1656
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,880
participating in the same type of operations as Legacy,

1657
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,680
I hate to break it to you, it's not even remotely close.

1658
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,680
It's much more peaceful, it's much more informative,

1659
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,440
and something that's gonna be a little bit more transparent

1660
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,840
compared to what Legacy's doing.

1661
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,280
So it could have been a different program

1662
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,520
outside of Jake's that referred to the P3s

1663
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,720
as like pink assets.

1664
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,680
That's what the program calls them, or pink assets.

1665
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,200
What's pink assets?

1666
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,800
Biological equipment like cattle, right?

1667
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,120
Yeah, that has always stood out to me.

1668
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,920
Granted, that is something that has been communicated to me

1669
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,240
is that some of the programs refer to them as that.

1670
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,280
Doesn't mean Jake thinks that that's the case,

1671
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,120
or at least that's how he personally views these people,

1672
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,800
because he doesn't view them that way,

1673
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,520
but this is what the program treats them like.

1674
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,800
Now, corporations out there are no different.

1675
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,040
Big corporations treat people like numbers.

1676
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,640
Okay, well guess what, this guy died,

1677
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,360
so we have another person filling his spot,

1678
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,600
and we can forget about it.

1679
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,080
The military's the same way, it's just a constant rider

1680
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:35,120
of repeating the trainings and getting people in these roles

1681
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,360
and then basically getting them up.

1682
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,480
If somebody gets out, they get in, or they get killed,

1683
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,760
they get another person to fill the slot.

1684
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,520
So it's really no different from that,

1685
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,800
but in the same token, because it's so abstract,

1686
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,160
that people wanna lynch onto and say, oh, this is evil.

1687
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,960
Well, military's doing the same thing.

1688
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,960
Is there a way to do this that is above board?

1689
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,800
It brings up all these philosophical questions,

1690
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,920
because it's like, I'm all for protecting the free world,

1691
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,480
and I do, the people who create some false equivalents

1692
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,680
between the way people live in domestic China right now,

1693
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,840
in the US, as messed up as our country is,

1694
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,760
I think I'd much rather live here,

1695
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,520
and I'm all for protecting it.

1696
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,520
And so there are these game theoretic dynamics

1697
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,720
where I'm sure they're doing similar things.

1698
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,600
But then the meta-philosophical question is like,

1699
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,160
we're talking about aspects of the sacred,

1700
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,760
and I don't know what these beings are.

1701
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,840
They could be angels, they could be demons,

1702
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,680
I don't know what they are.

1703
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,360
Well, angels and demons don't need flying saucers

1704
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,440
to come here, let's get that straight.

1705
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,760
So you think they're extraterrestrials?

1706
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,600
100%.

1707
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,120
But if they're not bad, you're just baiting them

1708
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:44,960
and zapping them out of the sky.

1709
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,160
It's no different than if I was to have an exotic car

1710
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,280
driving through a bad neighborhood

1711
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,640
and they decided to shoot me and steal my car

1712
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,480
because it was-

1713
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,960
But that would be messed up for them to do.

1714
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,800
That's exactly it.

1715
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,120
You want to talk about the ethical conflict here

1716
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,200
because that's really what it is.

1717
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,240
This is the reason why Jake came forward, right?

1718
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,040
Because there's nothing that he was,

1719
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,800
there were things going on that he was not a fan of.

1720
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,800
Right, because I think Greer has spoken about this,

1721
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,840
that when he spoke to Jake,

1722
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,880
Jake relayed that craft were being down

1723
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,200
and he was deeply-

1724
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,800
He was bothered by that, 100%,

1725
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,880
especially with the P3 is the way they're treated.

1726
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,880
So, and his goal now is to just get them killed peacefully?

1727
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,040
Because there might be biologics in the craft.

1728
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,000
If that's the case, you are attorney,

1729
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,480
possibly living biologics to dead biologics.

1730
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,440
Well, and that's what happens when they fall in the sky

1731
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,560
because they're subject to our laws of the universe

1732
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,040
with inertia and gravity and all that kind of stuff.

1733
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,560
If we could peacefully commune with these things,

1734
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,480
that would be amazing.

1735
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,320
I just-

1736
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,800
Well, and I think that's what Dr. Greer's

1737
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,600
whole CE5 initiative is all about,

1738
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,000
which I've personally attended a few of them.

1739
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,320
Who you invited me to because it's more like,

1740
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,480
I like to see things firsthand to see whether or not

1741
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,480
there's anything credible.

1742
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,240
And yeah, Dr. Greer's CE5 is very real.

1743
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,400
It's very incredible.

1744
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,480
And it's something that I think a lot of people

1745
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:03,560
need to understand that that's not by any means false.

1746
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:07,200
But if you listen to the ancient traditional version

1747
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,080
of this stuff, it's always like,

1748
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,280
you need to be 35, married, grounded.

1749
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,480
Like you shouldn't like try to summon anything.

1750
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,080
This is the thing as we're going off of interpretation,

1751
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:21,360
what one person's interpretation is not gonna share

1752
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,920
the same as the other person's.

1753
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,880
Your interpretations are different than mine.

1754
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,080
Mine are different from yours and so on.

1755
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,120
It's just whatever you personally experienced,

1756
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,400
whatever has been your upbringing,

1757
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,360
whatever you believe and value wise

1758
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,840
is going to shape your narrative

1759
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:37,160
and what your thought process of a situation is.

1760
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,280
So if you're brought up on the more

1761
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,000
religious aspect of things, then yes,

1762
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,680
you're gonna think aliens are angels or demons.

1763
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,240
If you're somebody who's esoteric,

1764
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,240
you're gonna say, okay, it's interdimensional

1765
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,360
or it's something that could be extra solar, right?

1766
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,000
But it depends on what your upbringing is

1767
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,280
and what you believe in yourself of what it might be.

1768
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,800
But it doesn't mean it's correct.

1769
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,480
And so do you think these things come down

1770
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,920
and then we're talking about this octagonal,

1771
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,640
eight-gon shaped craft that seems to be possibly manmade,

1772
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,720
material derived from what lands

1773
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,560
or gets zapped out of the sky,

1774
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,320
then gets reverse engineered or implemented

1775
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,840
in these terrestrial exotic craft that we build?

1776
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,360
Is that right?

1777
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,880
To my understanding, that's exactly how it happens.

1778
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,960
From my understanding, from what's been related to me,

1779
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,040
was that every craft that they recover,

1780
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,720
they also make reverse engineered versions

1781
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,080
of trying to replicate that technology

1782
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,760
or that specific craft.

1783
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,480
So this, I mean, Jake saw pretty much the same thing,

1784
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,760
except much smaller,

1785
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,000
that something that was able to be lifted up by a helicopter,

1786
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,320
this fucking thing is estimated 300 feet.

1787
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,960
I don't think his helicopter could pick something up

1788
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,640
that big, you know?

1789
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,360
So it'd take probably several helicopters,

1790
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,600
but in the same token.

1791
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,760
So you think what you saw was a reverse engineered,

1792
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,440
manmade version of what he saw?

1793
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,120
Could he have locked on to it possibly?

1794
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,080
Possibly, because I mean, again,

1795
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,080
there's different groups all over the world

1796
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,160
that are doing the same thing.

1797
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,080
So yes, there's multiple black sites

1798
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,600
that probably have P3s that are being used

1799
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,720
to lure craft out and then to shoot them down.

1800
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,480
That was the most fascinating part of my Jake interview

1801
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,240
is he was like, who is we?

1802
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,640
And I was like, I don't know,

1803
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,400
I assume like the US or like whatever,

1804
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,960
you know, space corporations he might be working for.

1805
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,760
And then he was like, no.

1806
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,600
We don't have shit.

1807
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,160
Yeah, he's like, it's all, he's like, it's black money.

1808
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,360
It was almost like it was like mafia wars

1809
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:34,120
and international, transnational corporations and interests,

1810
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,680
you know, across the world doing this stuff.

1811
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,720
And yeah, try to investigate this subject,

1812
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,040
particularly with the vehicle you saw

1813
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,240
hit so many dead ends.

1814
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,400
I mean, it's been talked about publicly by Greer,

1815
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,640
but he always says that he knows the craft you saw,

1816
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,920
the souped up version of the eight gun that Jake retrieved

1817
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,840
is made by the Lockheed Skunk Works in Northrop Grumman.

1818
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,200
He says that I myself have pressed into that

1819
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,080
with the integral you do art for him

1820
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,240
and say, where does he get this?

1821
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,320
Well, that's the thing is I think it's speculation.

1822
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,680
I mean, because unless you're physically working

1823
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,000
for these companies, you're not gonna know what's what.

1824
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,880
I mean, he may be connecting the dots

1825
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,040
because he's talked to over a thousand other people

1826
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,520
that may have been working for these programs

1827
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,920
and maybe have articulated something personally to him.

1828
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,560
I'm not entirely sure of because I'm not in Greer's head.

1829
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,880
What I will say is that this field

1830
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,240
offers a lot of speculation

1831
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,520
and it offers a lot of confusion.

1832
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,640
Because really at the end of the day,

1833
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,240
we only know what we experience personally

1834
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,160
and what your interpretation of it

1835
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,200
and how you tell the story

1836
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,560
is going to be different than what you say

1837
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,000
because here's the problem.

1838
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,440
Every time you retell a story, you're reframing it

1839
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,560
based off of memory as much as you can.

1840
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,320
So yes, I understand that for myself with this story.

1841
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,840
There could be details left out that I don't remember

1842
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,440
or there could be a certain thing.

1843
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,040
So it's just going off of memory

1844
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,280
of what you retell your reframing.

1845
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,000
So with Jake's incident,

1846
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,560
with him red teaming the event,

1847
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:10,920
I think one of the things that is a little bit hard for me

1848
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,280
to accept is the fact that this meeting back-channeled

1849
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,840
from somebody in the programs

1850
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,160
doesn't happen with anybody.

1851
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,680
It didn't happen to Hecker, it didn't happen to DC Long,

1852
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,920
it didn't happen to Steven Degna,

1853
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,720
it hasn't happened to anybody else I know.

1854
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,080
These are all witnesses who came forward with you

1855
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,560
and some of them went on Sean Ryan.

1856
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,960
I'm the only one that has been corroborated with

1857
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,960
or by people.

1858
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,800
Why do you think they chose you specifically?

1859
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,360
Because they know what I experienced

1860
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,200
because of what their personal involvement is

1861
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,000
with what they experienced.

1862
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,280
And that's kind of the thing of why he offered

1863
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,320
when I went out to go see him for the first time personally,

1864
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,080
not at the event, but just on a personal basis

1865
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,200
to explain what I saw.

1866
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,360
And one of the things that was,

1867
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,800
because anybody can say that

1868
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,400
they're a part of something, right?

1869
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,640
But how do we really know?

1870
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:07,360
Well, when Jake took me on a nice little trip

1871
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,000
out to the desert, that was something that proved to me

1872
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,840
that this guy was legit.

1873
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:12,680
What'd you see?

1874
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,160
I'm not gonna tell you.

1875
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,920
I can't talk about that.

1876
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,680
I'm not gonna burn Jake in the process

1877
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,200
because I had given him my word

1878
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,480
that it was not going to do that.

1879
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,440
He could have easily had me sign an NDA

1880
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,160
or originally they wanted to blindfold me

1881
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,400
and then just take it off and basically here you are.

1882
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,880
But that didn't happen.

1883
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,840
But you saw something cool and mind blowing

1884
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,720
and confirming of his prior states?

1885
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,240
Personally, yes, yes.

1886
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,080
Personally, yes.

1887
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:40,920
Are you at least able to say

1888
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,240
if this was above or below ground?

1889
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,080
I can't tell you.

1890
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,640
Gotcha.

1891
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,400
I'm not gonna hint to either or because I just, you know,

1892
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,120
like I said, I don't wanna burn Jake.

1893
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:49,960
Of course.

1894
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:53,160
He's the reason why I've been included

1895
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,520
in certain aspects of this

1896
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,960
because for me, he wanted me to have firsthand experience

1897
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,040
with a lot of things that are about the subject.

1898
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,800
And he didn't have to do any of this for me.

1899
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,960
He could have just laid low.

1900
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,960
He could have just done his original job

1901
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,160
and I would have never seen,

1902
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,600
I would have never understood it.

1903
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,800
I could have been just labeled one of the crazy psychopaths

1904
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,520
that some people think I am and that could have been it.

1905
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,360
Have you learned anything more about the fact

1906
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:22,000
that maybe we have reverse engineered working craft

1907
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,320
like this eight gun craft in our possession

1908
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,120
that we've actually built and we know how to fly

1909
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:26,960
and that sort of thing.

1910
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,400
This idea of alien reproduction vehicles,

1911
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,320
which check out Gerb's channel, he does amazing work on

1912
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,400
and he talks about the Mark McCandlish story.

1913
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,280
Have you heard anything confirming of that?

1914
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:40,800
Yes, I have, but it's not something

1915
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,320
from Jake's side of the house, for example.

1916
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,840
It's more with other people

1917
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,320
that I've been in communications with.

1918
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,920
Anything you can share?

1919
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,120
Well, I mean, I can just say that they exist.

1920
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:52,960
Okay.

1921
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,240
And I know where some of them are stored at,

1922
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,520
but that's about it.

1923
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,520
And do you think that the designs are copied

1924
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:04,840
or we derive material from the UFOs that come down?

1925
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,320
Or what's the relationship?

1926
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,720
My understanding is that we don't necessarily replicate

1927
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,600
the same materials these things are made out of.

1928
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,840
What my understanding is we have the same,

1929
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,240
they can get them to look the same

1930
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,720
using materials we have on earth.

1931
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,640
Probably even, of course, who's to say

1932
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,960
that they probably replicate the same materials too

1933
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,320
in the lab somewhere or they make them

1934
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,760
because they know what they're made of now

1935
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,920
because they've been doing this ever since the 40s and 50s.

1936
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,440
They've been bringing these craft out.

1937
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,280
So it's like design inspiration or mimicry or something?

1938
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,240
I think it's mimicry for the most part

1939
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:38,120
because if they get them to look, you know,

1940
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,000
something that looks extraterrestrial,

1941
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
but it's manmade and they want people to believe that,

1942
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,440
then by all means they're gonna do that.

1943
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,360
The other implication is that we have

1944
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,080
propulsion modalities in our possession

1945
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,600
and we can work this stuff.

1946
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,440
Yes, we can.

1947
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,600
That transcends chemical combustion

1948
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,120
and seems to break Newton's laws of conservation momentum

1949
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,200
and that sort of thing and leaves the trees

1950
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,040
unperturbed around, you know.

1951
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,880
Making no noises, nothing like that.

1952
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,480
I mean, I'm a car guy, you know.

1953
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,120
So if there is like a fast car,

1954
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,240
you implement this kind of technology into,

1955
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,400
it'd be pretty incredible.

1956
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,880
It'd be very dangerous, but.

1957
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,960
Can we get any of this working civil side?

1958
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,600
Is that a good aspiration?

1959
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,840
Let me ask you something.

1960
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,800
Somebody who, let's just say you come up with something

1961
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,600
that could be very beneficial, but for you,

1962
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,840
you understand it can make you money

1963
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,960
or you can control people with it

1964
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,240
and it puts you on a playing field

1965
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,680
that's above everybody else.

1966
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,480
Nobody else has the same stuff you do,

1967
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,120
but if you're this person who's greedy

1968
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,640
and this person who likes the aspect

1969
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,920
of being able to do whatever you want,

1970
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,960
except you get to fold it into some people

1971
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,320
who make decisions, i.e. lawmakers,

1972
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,840
and you pay them a lot of money

1973
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,520
or you pay them money to basically steer clear,

1974
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,080
donate to their campaigns,

1975
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,440
and you basically are above the law,

1976
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,840
you can coerce politicians,

1977
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,640
you can coerce military officials, generals, you name it,

1978
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,480
by just throwing them sacks of cash.

1979
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,280
Are you gonna really wanna share with everybody

1980
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,480
if you have the stranglehood

1981
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,760
in the most powerful country in the entire planet?

1982
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,840
I think most people wouldn't,

1983
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,840
but I'd like to think I would, but.

1984
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:17,800
I don't know.

1985
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,320
I mean, humanity.

1986
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,320
Or not necessarily,

1987
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,800
but isn't there a midpoint between those two things

1988
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,480
where you use it as leverage

1989
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:32,080
to get dictatorships abroad to reform

1990
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,280
and you black box it in certain ways

1991
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,480
that can't be reverse engineered,

1992
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,400
you dole it out in civil infrastructure,

1993
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,920
you still make the world a better place,

1994
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,080
but you also allow it to confer an advantage.

1995
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,960
Fiber optics and night vision and stuff like that, right?

1996
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,280
So you've got the Philip Corso narrative.

1997
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,120
To an extent.

1998
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,120
I think that what's derived from it's real,

1999
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,320
but I don't, you know, his theory of how they were,

2000
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,960
you know, we have jetliners

2001
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,120
that can fly through a lightning storm, no problem,

2002
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,560
and very dense thunderstorms that have a lot of lightning

2003
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,960
and they get hit by it and nothing happens.

2004
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,480
So why is something that's not even from this planet

2005
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,920
or from a different civilization

2006
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,600
that's more advanced than we are,

2007
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,840
why is something gonna be susceptible to a lightning strike?

2008
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,200
It's not.

2009
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,520
Do you know when we cracked gravity,

2010
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,960
if this is using like electro-gravitic propulsion,

2011
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,280
do you have any theories around?

2012
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,120
Well, just from what's been already disclosed,

2013
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,400
which is 1954.

2014
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,240
Okay.

2015
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:28,760
We've had the hook on gravity control since then.

2016
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,120
And what was 54 specifically?

2017
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,680
Well, it's just from what Greer has alleged,

2018
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,640
one of his teammates that was in a vault

2019
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,680
that saw the documents that talked about

2020
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,160
gaining that kind of control.

2021
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,200
Interesting.

2022
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,360
And this guy has been on the record several times.

2023
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,040
I don't know his name specifically,

2024
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,320
but he's been mentioned quite a bit.

2025
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,440
There was some experiment

2026
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:51,160
where we tied electromagnetism to gravity.

2027
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,120
Based off of like even, for example,

2028
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,080
when they retrieved the stuff from Nazi Germany

2029
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,360
back in the 40s and then sent them over here

2030
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,880
with Operation Paperclip.

2031
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,560
Now this can get into a whole different conversation.

2032
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:07,200
But they had some disks that they recovered.

2033
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,320
The Nazis did.

2034
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,720
The Nazis developed the stuff, but it wasn't stable.

2035
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,840
So when they brought them over here,

2036
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,360
of course you had the best scientists

2037
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,400
who were already working on this kind of stuff

2038
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,320
that were able to amplify it somehow.

2039
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,320
Now that you have the US government backing you,

2040
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,120
giving you citizenship,

2041
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,920
basically giving you a right to do whatever you want

2042
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,120
because you need your help.

2043
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:25,960
Yep.

2044
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:26,800
And this is how NASA was created

2045
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,800
because it was a German who created this.

2046
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:29,640
Yeah.

2047
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,960
It was also the CIA and the FBI were created

2048
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,840
by these people too.

2049
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,880
Yeah, everything you're saying now,

2050
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,880
I can tell you it was definitively factual.

2051
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:35,720
Right.

2052
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,200
It's not conspiracy.

2053
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,680
Wernher von Braun, Arthur Rudolph,

2054
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,760
basically the NASA Saturn project was a transplantation

2055
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,280
of the Nazi space program.

2056
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:48,000
And then you had Richard Mita, Victor Schauberger,

2057
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
a lot of these guys, Henry Kawanda,

2058
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,480
who were working on lenticular aerodyne saucers.

2059
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:56,040
Either they moved over to the US,

2060
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,640
or in Mita's case, I believe there's speculation

2061
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,440
he worked on the Avrocar project, the Canadian version.

2062
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,800
Schauberger, I know the Army Counterintelligence Corps

2063
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,160
tricked into giving all of his propulsion,

2064
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,760
exotic propulsion stuff to the US.

2065
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,880
And that made it actually to Brookhaven National Labs,

2066
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,480
which was a Nick Cooke documentary.

2067
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,880
That even brings up the question,

2068
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,960
did we even really win World War II if that happened?

2069
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,760
If we took the brightest minds,

2070
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:24,360
the top military leaders of the Third Reich,

2071
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,360
and brought them here,

2072
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,280
and they basically got into positions of power

2073
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,840
and influenced our government

2074
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,520
and created intelligence agencies,

2075
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,800
which they wanted to replicate in Nazi Germany,

2076
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,240
we are living present day

2077
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,480
of what they wanted to accomplish back in the 40s.

2078
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,600
I speak fluent German.

2079
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,280
I know a lot about German history.

2080
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,240
And I know for a fact that...

2081
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,960
This is like this Philip K. Dick man

2082
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,000
in the high castle narrative,

2083
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,360
but like an undercover version or something.

2084
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:53,400
So what, so if they infiltrated our highest ranks,

2085
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,360
which they sort of did,

2086
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:57,560
but do you think they sort of maintained Nazi allegiances?

2087
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,680
Well, look at what happened with Ukraine.

2088
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,000
This is what people don't talk about.

2089
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,160
Look at them waving Nazi flags.

2090
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,360
A lot of the people that went out of Nazi Germany

2091
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,000
went and occupied that area.

2092
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,080
There's Nazis here.

2093
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,520
I mean, look at some of the prisons and stuff,

2094
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,280
like the Aryan gangs,

2095
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,400
but yes, there's societies that have Nazi influence in them.

2096
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,480
I can tell you for a fact.

2097
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,720
So what Hitler wanted to achieve

2098
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,920
was a militarized police force.

2099
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,960
What do we have now?

2100
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,640
A militarized police force.

2101
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:26,080
We have basically healthcare, some free healthcare.

2102
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,320
They have some sort of system for education,

2103
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,920
which is what they wanted to do.

2104
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,400
They wanted to basically put a ban on smoking a whole lot

2105
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,720
because they wanted healthier people.

2106
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,680
And it was funny because even as a Freemason,

2107
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:41,360
one of the things that Hitler despised was us as Freemasons

2108
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,520
because of the secrecy that we have

2109
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,680
and the way that we do rituals,

2110
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,640
which is nothing spectacular to an extent

2111
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,200
because it's just tradition.

2112
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,240
But one of the things that he liked

2113
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:54,680
was how we kept things very secret and very word of mouth,

2114
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:58,240
i.e. what we call a pass and a grip.

2115
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,640
So a password and then a grip is obviously a handshake,

2116
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,960
depending on what degree you are,

2117
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,400
that demonstrates what kind of grip you will give.

2118
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,240
And then of course,

2119
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,920
there's some grips that you give in the public

2120
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,360
and there's grips that you give

2121
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,240
only behind the doors of a lodge.

2122
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,880
No, I mean, yeah, like Werner von Braun,

2123
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,680
Rudolf Hess, Himmler,

2124
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,800
all these guys were really interested in the occult.

2125
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,800
Everybody on that top level was because that's,

2126
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,960
so part of this council form relations

2127
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,400
was something that helped set up the CIA.

2128
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,680
Well, do you think most of these people

2129
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,000
that were in the CFR at the time,

2130
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,920
they were people who were read into the occult

2131
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:36,160
or participated in themselves in some of these societies?

2132
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,840
That's how they learned the secrecy in these programs

2133
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,840
was based off of these organizations

2134
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,920
that know how to keep things compartmentalized,

2135
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,560
that should sound familiar.

2136
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,840
So they keep people segmented

2137
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,360
and then they basically bring people

2138
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,720
onto those segmented parts to basically stay in their lane.

2139
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,280
This is how you have different divisions

2140
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,680
and different things that people work on

2141
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,080
that basically integrate into a bigger picture.

2142
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,720
You're almost implying that they're like control systems

2143
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,560
that go deeper than just, you know,

2144
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,080
NDAs and this is your directive.

2145
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,720
Very much so, that is the truth.

2146
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,280
And this has happened for thousands of years.

2147
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,560
This is no different.

2148
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,480
The only difference is, is the people who exist today

2149
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,440
are taking the influence from the past

2150
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,680
and still implementing it.

2151
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,080
So when the next person steps in line,

2152
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,240
they get to do the same thing

2153
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,640
and basically keep it going the same way.

2154
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,040
Then it never changes.

2155
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,160
The only thing that changes

2156
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,840
is when you have people like Jake, for example,

2157
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,360
who come forward and expose

2158
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,720
what their personal experiences are

2159
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:37,880
and basically try to not necessarily shatter the secrecy,

2160
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,760
but they want certain parts of the secrecy to be out

2161
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,320
so that way humanity can benefit.

2162
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,880
I don't have a problem with that.

2163
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,240
What do you guys think is like,

2164
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:49,160
because Disclosure's in this very interesting place now

2165
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:52,880
where I feel like it's made kind of a quantum leap forward

2166
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,320
and then mainstream society.

2167
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:57,280
I mean, a lot of this stuff came out around the inauguration.

2168
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:00,800
And if you look at like what's happening in the White House

2169
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,600
and with USAID and like Doge,

2170
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,280
like most people are concerned with that

2171
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,600
and they don't give a shit about UFOs.

2172
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,680
And then you have UFO world where they're like,

2173
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,960
we have a guy who came out who said he retrieved

2174
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,400
a craft firsthand and it's like they're on an island

2175
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,520
like from the rest of society doesn't,

2176
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,200
there's some dark matter between them

2177
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,400
that's like undetectable.

2178
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,640
So where does Disclosure go from here

2179
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,880
and is there like an aspirational, you know,

2180
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,920
good place for it to go directionally?

2181
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,440
Well, let me ask you something.

2182
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,480
So everybody understands how the government

2183
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,240
is astray these days, right?

2184
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,320
Yeah.

2185
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,480
So you have all these moving parts

2186
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,800
and people don't know what they're doing

2187
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,840
or they do know what they're doing,

2188
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,840
but there's just so many different things

2189
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,640
that are developing within the government right now.

2190
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:47,760
Do you think realistically pulling these technologies

2191
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,800
from these black programs and putting them

2192
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,240
into the hands of people who don't know

2193
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:53,640
what the fuck they're doing is a smart move?

2194
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,880
No, it's not.

2195
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,360
Not Willie Neil, not like, you know, yeah.

2196
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,880
This is why amnesty and this is why this needs

2197
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,000
to get more transparent, at least for a government.

2198
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,280
Now, some of the free energy tech we could benefit from,

2199
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,040
but as far as the craft or being able to fly,

2200
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,560
that can stay top secret and it can just be like,

2201
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,280
yeah, we know nuclear weapons exist

2202
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,880
or thermonuclear weapons.

2203
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,640
We don't know how they work, but we know they exist.

2204
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,480
It could be the same way.

2205
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,680
Yeah, shouldn't that be the right analogy

2206
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,800
where it's like nuclear physics

2207
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,080
versus nuclear trade secrets?

2208
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:23,920
Correct.

2209
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:24,760
Where it's like, obviously, yeah,

2210
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:25,880
we shouldn't let trade secret that,

2211
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,600
as far as the physics should be open.

2212
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,600
I can tell you personally that I don't think

2213
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,240
the government would even have any kind of first indication

2214
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,400
on how to manage these programs.

2215
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,040
They're not gonna know what to do with it.

2216
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,320
If they're so, and this is the problem,

2217
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:41,480
to your face, they're gonna tell you

2218
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,680
they're all about the right motives

2219
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:46,040
or doing the right thing for this country.

2220
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,480
But when push comes to shove

2221
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,640
and they don't wanna do a fucking thing about it,

2222
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:52,240
they're gonna put people, oh, it's my political career

2223
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,280
I give a shit more about.

2224
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:56,200
Well, Congress has an 11% approval rating.

2225
01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:00,120
I've always thought one of the most overrated versions

2226
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,640
of disclosure is having congressional oversight over it.

2227
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,800
I think a lot of these guys don't know their asses

2228
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,640
from their foreheads.

2229
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,480
No, they don't.

2230
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,560
As far as the public understanding

2231
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,440
basic ontological truths and benefiting to the extent

2232
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,600
they can from the tech,

2233
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,400
that feels like a clear net good.

2234
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,320
What you and I have as an expectation for the government

2235
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,320
is much different than what they have for themselves.

2236
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,000
Their expectations is I get to go home every night,

2237
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,400
I get to check my bank account

2238
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,920
and make sure I'm getting paid the same funding

2239
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,200
I got last year or if not more

2240
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,440
and that their reputation still sticks around

2241
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,880
as I'm Senator so-and-so

2242
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,920
and I'm this cool person because I'm in government.

2243
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,280
Yeah, I mean, it's an oligarchy,

2244
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,800
it's special interests run the entire thing.

2245
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,080
These people are not powerful at all.

2246
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,680
This group that has this kind of stuff

2247
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,320
is way more powerful than them.

2248
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,720
So these guys on Capitol Hill

2249
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,040
that think that their shit doesn't stink,

2250
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,400
I hate to break it to you guys,

2251
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,440
you guys are pawns.

2252
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,280
So you think that the UFO legacy programs

2253
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,640
are almost like breakaway power fiefdoms

2254
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,960
that have leverage over the federal government?

2255
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,560
Oh yeah, they have more money than our government.

2256
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:00,920
Are you kidding?

2257
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:04,320
So you think, like with this transition,

2258
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,200
do these UFO programs automatically roll up to Trump

2259
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,360
or are they their own thing?

2260
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,120
They're gonna be their own thing because here's the thing,

2261
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,440
Trump's not gonna know what to do with this

2262
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,920
because most of the people on Capitol Hill

2263
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:13,960
don't believe in this shit

2264
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:17,760
and some of the ones that do are very far and few between.

2265
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,840
But Trump has to know that this stuff is real.

2266
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:21,680
You don't think so?

2267
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,880
But his son on his podcast interviewed Ross Coulthart

2268
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,680
before Ross Coulthart broke the Jake story

2269
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:31,200
and I'm just reading between the lines and speculating.

2270
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,720
Let me break it to you.

2271
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,640
I've had meetings with some of these people

2272
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,600
in Trump's administration.

2273
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,800
I can back it up because I got photographic evidence

2274
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,960
and I participate in a lot of meetings in Washington

2275
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,120
because of what I'm able to provide them

2276
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,720
as far as little bit of advice,

2277
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:50,880
but a little bit more like personal experience, okay?

2278
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,240
They will say it, yes, they're interested into it

2279
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,120
but when their political careers come up

2280
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,040
because now they're gonna be thought of in that cases.

2281
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,840
Every single person in this field is thought of that.

2282
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,680
It's the stigma until you have somebody like Trump,

2283
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:08,320
for example, he's more fixated on things

2284
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:13,160
that are more short-term that can be a long-term thing

2285
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,120
which is great.

2286
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,000
I'm not bashing that.

2287
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,160
I think his approach of trying to clean up the government

2288
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,680
is great because what happens is now they start seeing

2289
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:24,520
funding go in different directions that's not known.

2290
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,960
When that's apparent, that is gonna basically say,

2291
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,680
where is this money going to?

2292
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,520
Then you're gonna have people like Jake knocking

2293
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:33,120
on the door saying, I know exactly where that's going to

2294
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,040
and it's going to these programs.

2295
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,560
Well, what are these programs centered around?

2296
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,200
Well, NHI technology or reverse engineered

2297
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,240
and all this kind of stuff.

2298
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,240
So it could segue into it.

2299
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,560
What's gonna happen with disclosure

2300
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,160
is not an overnight thing.

2301
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,720
This is gonna be something that has to take

2302
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,720
a few generations for people to understand

2303
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:55,480
because this is unfortunately how fast humans learn.

2304
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:59,240
You know a lot about the money flow of like all this stuff.

2305
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,440
You wanna just talk about that?

2306
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,480
Yeah, I gotta say, I fully agree with you guys

2307
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,800
that disclosure probably will come from the Congress.

2308
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,320
I mean, look at Kirk McConnell,

2309
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,560
the staffer for Senator Gillibrand

2310
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,560
on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

2311
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,800
Since 2017, he has been pulling witnesses,

2312
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,440
talking to witnesses and briefing his Senator.

2313
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:18,920
He's great, he knows a lot.

2314
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,120
I know, I talked to him in a skiff.

2315
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,640
Okay, so you spoke to him directly first hand.

2316
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,640
Yeah, so he's a good guy.

2317
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:28,080
Yeah, because at Seoul, he was asked by a couple individuals

2318
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,520
if he had heard of a blue on blue firefight team

2319
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,680
with a Lockheed retrieval team

2320
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:35,440
and about transporting humans in reverse engineered craft.

2321
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,640
And he said both he had heard.

2322
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,920
Yes, so definitely you have talked to him.

2323
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,320
So that sounds like maybe the craft is Lockheed.

2324
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,200
I agree.

2325
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,680
But as far as the money, I mean,

2326
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,960
I agree that this is probably like a black programs

2327
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:49,960
or breakaway projects.

2328
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,920
I think most of these operate in DOD laboratories

2329
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:57,240
or various MRTFBs, major range test facility bases.

2330
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,080
A lot of these have underground locations.

2331
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:03,760
This cashflow is generally moved through FFRDCs,

2332
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,600
Federally Funded Research and Development Centers

2333
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,680
or UARCs, University Affiliated Research Centers.

2334
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:11,080
And this is so the federal government can,

2335
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,280
those who know when the federal government can engage

2336
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,360
with legacy programs operations through these FFRDCs

2337
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:20,320
and UARCs to make joint USG and contractor programs,

2338
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,960
the block programs as we think of them.

2339
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,880
Give us a few big examples of FFRDCs.

2340
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,160
MITRE, RAND, Center for Naval Analysis,

2341
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:30,600
the IDA Institute for Defense Analysis.

2342
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,920
How much money do these organizations get?

2343
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:36,440
Tons, and there's something called Crystal City.

2344
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,520
Do we have a sense of like,

2345
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,320
cause it's like, yeah, what's Crystal City?

2346
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,760
Crystal City is a location just south of the Pentagon

2347
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,960
in Washington, DC.

2348
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,320
That is where pretty much all of the biggest

2349
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,560
defense contractors are.

2350
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,680
It's in Arlington, right?

2351
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:48,680
Yeah, yeah.

2352
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,760
Yeah, you have the Aerospace Corporation,

2353
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,640
you have the IDA, you have the CNA,

2354
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,360
the Center for Naval Analyses.

2355
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,720
And I really think the amount of money that's moved

2356
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,800
can't really be tracked because I myself have talked

2357
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,880
to witnesses who have seen cash moved,

2358
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,840
like physical bales of cash taken to locations.

2359
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,920
Most of the transactions are in cash.

2360
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,880
And this is something that most, even people I've talked to

2361
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,200
have talked about that that's how they do things.

2362
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,360
Everything's self-funded in that regard, right?

2363
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:19,080
So if you have a program that you can benefit

2364
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,040
off of siphoning funds from the government, right?

2365
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,840
Tax dollars that get allocated to that,

2366
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,160
but then you don't have to tell people

2367
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:27,760
what you're specifically doing and just say,

2368
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:28,960
yeah, it's going to this program

2369
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,800
and we need 60 billion for it, right?

2370
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,160
So then when it gets to a point of them actually generating

2371
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,880
own revenue by themselves,

2372
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,680
they still need that lifeline of government funding

2373
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,960
because then it gives them a purpose

2374
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,000
because the government gives them

2375
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,440
the legal authority to do so.

2376
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,680
If the government was like, you know what?

2377
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:46,320
We know what you guys are doing is bullshit.

2378
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,480
We're going to go ahead and cut off funding.

2379
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,400
Well, they're still making money,

2380
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,920
but that's the thing that they'll discover

2381
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:52,000
is how they're making money,

2382
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,920
which is not in a legal sense, right?

2383
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,160
Because they're still kept from the government.

2384
01:26:56,160 --> 01:27:00,240
You're using tax dollars to generate programs,

2385
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:02,200
which then can generate revenue,

2386
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:05,040
which then enrich certain people's lives

2387
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:08,120
or they use it to replicate technologies, if you will.

2388
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,800
So essentially, if they figure out

2389
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:14,080
everything they're doing is illegal, then guess what?

2390
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,000
They're not going to risk it.

2391
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,920
So what are they going to do?

2392
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,960
They're going to continue lying to everybody on Capitol Hill.

2393
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,760
And because some of these senators and politicians

2394
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,040
that are also read into this,

2395
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,520
but at least maybe they're getting,

2396
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,040
hey, I'll give you a couple of million for your campaign.

2397
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,200
Just don't look over here.

2398
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,040
Right.

2399
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,040
It happens all the time.

2400
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:31,960
Yeah.

2401
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,840
Well, you have, you know, Congressman Mike Turner,

2402
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:37,800
who represents the district that right

2403
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,560
Wright-Patterson, which is the center of all UFO lore

2404
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:44,200
and reverse engineering, back to Roswell.

2405
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:48,120
And I believe his top three donors are Boeing, Lockheed,

2406
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,040
and maybe I'm getting the third one, Raytheon.

2407
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:50,880
You know, some-

2408
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:51,720
It is Raytheon.

2409
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:52,560
It is Raytheon.

2410
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:57,560
And he basically helped NICS, the eminent domain clause,

2411
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,680
you know, as part of the-

2412
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,040
I'll explain why that happened, all right?

2413
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:06,600
Now everybody thinks, oh shit, that sucked.

2414
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:08,080
We didn't get anything out of that.

2415
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:08,920
Yes, we did.

2416
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:13,840
We understand that it's always gonna be

2417
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,640
one step forward, two steps back.

2418
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:17,640
We're gonna figure out what's going on

2419
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:19,280
and who's a part of what.

2420
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:22,920
When that was gutted and who opposed it

2421
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,240
was basically saying, hey, we're the ones that oppose it.

2422
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,080
Now we know who's a part of it.

2423
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:31,360
So ideally having them NICS, that was a good thing

2424
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,920
because they exposed themselves to us.

2425
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,320
Now we know what to look for and who to look for.

2426
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,560
So it wasn't a bad thing.

2427
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,680
It was expected, but it was a good thing

2428
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:43,280
because now we know who's in charge of what.

2429
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,320
And Turner's out now, which is cool.

2430
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,280
And I think he was out because they figured it out,

2431
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:49,320
what he was doing.

2432
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,560
To an extent, not necessarily with UAP,

2433
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,400
but just with other programs, right?

2434
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,040
Do we have a sense of yearly,

2435
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,640
but like if the NDAA, National Defense Authorization Act,

2436
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,120
basically our defense budget yearly,

2437
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,600
is like 800, 900 billion,

2438
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,800
do you have a sense of how much of that is UFO?

2439
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,000
Or is UFO off the books

2440
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:07,520
and is it even greater than that?

2441
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,760
Probably off the books,

2442
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,440
but there's one example of specific monetary value

2443
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,560
I can't talk about.

2444
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,880
So I covered once a witness, codenamed Ed,

2445
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:18,160
who talked of a joint reverse engineering program

2446
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,200
between the Nevada Test and Trade Range

2447
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,560
and Edwards Air Force Base,

2448
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:24,760
two highly prolific locations,

2449
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,000
done a ton of analysis on there.

2450
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,560
But this individual, after his time at the Air Force,

2451
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,160
he went on to work for the Pentagon

2452
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,440
for the research, development, test, and evaluation

2453
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,360
panel chain for the Air Force.

2454
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:39,120
It was here during the span of I think 2012 to 2016,

2455
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,560
he spoke of $34 billion and $40 billion

2456
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,960
being scrubbed from the books

2457
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:47,240
for non-transfer of authority funds for the Air Force

2458
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,080
in respected years.

2459
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,520
I'm not sure which year is the 34 and which year is the 40,

2460
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,520
but just wiped off the books.

2461
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,800
But then simultaneous to all of this,

2462
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,880
if we're talking about octagonal shaped crafts

2463
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,920
that can use electro-gravitics,

2464
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:03,720
it's like China and Russia are like eating our lunch,

2465
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,080
as far as I know, on hypersonics.

2466
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,840
And so how do you kind of explain this?

2467
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:09,920
I will say this.

2468
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,160
And hypersonics are associated with the same contractors

2469
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:13,840
that are associated with this issue.

2470
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,480
Yeah, so it's always this question of

2471
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:16,880
have we actually just stagnated

2472
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,880
and this is just some softening of the enemy

2473
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,680
sort of narrative or whatever.

2474
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:25,600
I had an interesting meeting on Capitol Hill

2475
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,280
and one of the things that was brought up

2476
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:31,040
by a particular gentleman who knows of what's going on,

2477
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,080
I'm not gonna say who he is,

2478
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:34,760
but what he was able to figure out

2479
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:39,760
and provide us during that meeting was Russia and China

2480
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:43,720
have their own retrieval teams of non-human intelligence

2481
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:46,480
and they have their own technologies, reverse engineered.

2482
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,600
And they're pretty much on par with what we're doing.

2483
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:51,200
And it's to the point to where we,

2484
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,640
as in the United States assets that deal with this,

2485
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:56,000
have gentlemen's agreement with both countries

2486
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,680
to say if we target and shoot down NHI,

2487
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:01,600
whatever team gets their first gets the prize.

2488
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,000
Whatever team gets their second has to wave off.

2489
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:09,360
And this person's a pretty high place in the government.

2490
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,680
So the fact that that was established

2491
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:12,520
because that was a theory of mine,

2492
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,880
it's like we can't be the only people

2493
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:15,480
that have this in this country.

2494
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:17,120
But it's not even just these countries,

2495
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,080
it's this organization which is transnational.

2496
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,880
They just happen to exist in other countries

2497
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,960
that are doing the same stuff we do here.

2498
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:27,120
Do you think that this could bring us together?

2499
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,880
I mean, you have rumors of like Reagan and Gorbachev.

2500
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,240
This isn't even a rumor.

2501
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,600
Gorbachev, Mikhail Gorbachev says in an interview

2502
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:37,400
with Charlie Rose that he was sitting with Reagan

2503
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,200
at some like UN event or something.

2504
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,200
And Reagan, you know, whispers over in his ear.

2505
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:46,200
He says, if the United States were attacked

2506
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:50,360
by someone from outer space,

2507
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,320
would you help us?

2508
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,760
I said, no doubt about it.

2509
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,360
He said, we do.

2510
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:02,640
And so like, do you think there's any hope

2511
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,920
of this not being this sort of game theory dynamic,

2512
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,280
but actually sort of, you know,

2513
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:08,160
creating kind of peace between the nations?

2514
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,520
Or is that just totally naive?

2515
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,440
I think the only way that we're gonna get full disclosure

2516
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:15,080
is if we are peaceful to each other.

2517
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,680
I think if everybody puts their fucking swords down

2518
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,880
and understands that we have a bigger problem

2519
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,960
to deal with here and it's bigger than ourselves,

2520
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:23,840
this is the only way we're gonna gain ground.

2521
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,640
The problem with this field,

2522
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,760
if you wanna call UFOs or a community, right,

2523
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,280
I don't even consider me a part of it.

2524
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,680
I'm just somebody who saw something fucking crazy

2525
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,120
and here you go.

2526
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,800
So there's so much division.

2527
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,840
There's so many factions with this where everybody thinks,

2528
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,600
oh, this person's right, this person's wrong,

2529
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,960
or this doesn't make sense, or this makes sense.

2530
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,600
If everybody was to understand that

2531
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,120
we're all trying to do the same thing

2532
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,080
and we all group together,

2533
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,000
we could get so much further along with this.

2534
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,600
But everybody's like, oh, I hate this person because of this,

2535
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,960
or I heard this about this person.

2536
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,280
So, you know, he doesn't contribute anything.

2537
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:03,120
We have to be uniting together to make this happen.

2538
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,240
And that's the problem.

2539
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,520
I don't think it will ever happen

2540
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,000
unless everybody puts their damn swords down.

2541
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,280
The quote unquote UFO community,

2542
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,560
which I say, I think it's so cringe-worthy,

2543
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:17,560
but it's like a reality TV show.

2544
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,960
It's just this weird, I try to stay out of all of it,

2545
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:22,240
but it's so bizarre.

2546
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:24,400
I don't even pay attention to it because it's just,

2547
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:27,400
you know what, I got more important shit to deal with,

2548
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,440
such as either having these meetings

2549
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,480
or trying to gain ground on this.

2550
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:32,680
That's more my focus.

2551
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,000
I don't give a shit what other people say in this community.

2552
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,160
It's just like, you guys,

2553
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:40,160
they can criticize people so easy,

2554
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:42,200
but if they were ever called to go on Capitol Hill

2555
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,040
to talk, they would never do it.

2556
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:44,880
None of them would.

2557
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,960
Do you feel like people have ever tried to co-opt you,

2558
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:47,920
given your story?

2559
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,840
Because, I mean, you signed something,

2560
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,880
basically, with this Air Force Lieutenant Colonel,

2561
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:55,160
where it's like your life is under threat

2562
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,000
if you say something.

2563
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,920
Well, now that they've passed these laws,

2564
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,520
I mean, that doesn't apply.

2565
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,920
I mean, I have had some blowback.

2566
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:04,640
I've had harassment.

2567
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:07,360
I haven't had direct threats that I'm aware of,

2568
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,320
but other people have heard things,

2569
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,160
but I can't confirm that.

2570
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,440
But one of the instances,

2571
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:17,640
so when I testified to Aero in April of 2023,

2572
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:21,240
after that trip, I started having these helicopters

2573
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,720
hover over my house or my dad's residence

2574
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:26,080
for example, or over my business.

2575
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,480
What sort of helicopters?

2576
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:29,440
Some of them, most of the time, are Blackhawks.

2577
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:33,720
And then there's one particular CH-47,

2578
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:35,680
which is a dual-rotor helicopter.

2579
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,920
It's Army variant that doesn't matter

2580
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:40,520
where I'm at in the city.

2581
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:44,080
If I move to a different area, it pops up there.

2582
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,240
Really?

2583
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:49,240
And this has been, and it's weird because you can,

2584
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,640
I have Flightradar 24 where I can track these

2585
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:54,760
because I had referenced this to Jake

2586
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:56,480
almost several years ago,

2587
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,600
explaining that this is what kind of harassment,

2588
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,040
there's other people in the government as well

2589
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:03,000
that were having harassment like that happen to them too.

2590
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,280
And partially, I think that's why we can't rely

2591
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,960
on government to do disclosure

2592
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,840
because once they figure out what they're up against,

2593
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,480
they're not gonna do that.

2594
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,080
Something that has much more money than them,

2595
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,520
has their own private military, has their own assets,

2596
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:19,040
they're more cutting edge than compared to what we've got.

2597
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:20,840
But it's a symbiotic relationship

2598
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:23,600
because we need these contracting companies

2599
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:26,080
to help build stuff for our defense programs,

2600
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:28,480
which the government needs because this is what helps us

2601
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,400
keep as a superpower in this country,

2602
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:31,880
but it also curbs terrorism.

2603
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:33,560
It curbs wars that we could have

2604
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,400
in any other part of the world.

2605
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:36,600
We need them.

2606
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,200
So if we're to gut them from what they do best,

2607
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,600
and that basically weakens us as well

2608
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,200
because we need these companies to come up with our next

2609
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:49,200
generation seven fighter jet whenever that comes out

2610
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:53,800
or a new tank or new medical systems for military

2611
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,160
or whatever it is that they do.

2612
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:58,400
So gutting them would be something that would basically.

2613
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,600
So you think they're actually producing a lot of innovation

2614
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,120
because like society at large is stagnated

2615
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:03,960
when it comes to tech.

2616
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,640
Society has, but look at the military.

2617
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:08,280
It's much more advanced because that's their focus.

2618
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:09,280
That's the war machine.

2619
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,800
So if they don't have a war.

2620
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,720
But it also goes back and forth.

2621
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:14,720
Like you hear these stories of like nukes

2622
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,640
operating off floppy disks,

2623
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,080
the story in like 2017 or something.

2624
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:20,760
Yeah, I had talked about that.

2625
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:23,160
It was something that I found out personally

2626
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:27,080
was that they keep it archaic because it's harder to hack.

2627
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,400
You can't, if you have a signal that goes up top side.

2628
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,240
So that's intentional.

2629
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:31,080
That's intentional.

2630
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,320
Nor at operating offline.

2631
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,040
So no system for each.

2632
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:35,040
That's why they do it that way.

2633
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,480
And some of these black sites work the same way.

2634
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,800
So there was, whatever has to understand

2635
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:42,200
is black sites operate independently.

2636
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,640
Yes, they get funding from the government

2637
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:47,000
with some research and development programs that they do,

2638
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,960
but they operate entirely by themselves.

2639
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,840
It's almost like its own country.

2640
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,760
They got their own people to manage these things

2641
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:55,440
like these refugees they get from these other countries

2642
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:58,640
that they screen for P3 that don't make the cut.

2643
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:00,600
Well, they have them as janitors, cooks,

2644
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,000
people to maintain these facilities.

2645
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,680
For every single operator,

2646
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,640
you're gonna have 20 personnel

2647
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:07,880
that are gonna basically support that operator

2648
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:10,880
that are in these facilities, if that makes sense.

2649
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,880
Such as a medical officer, whatever that is,

2650
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,360
an admin people, payroll, if you will.

2651
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,440
So there are people essentially missing all over the world.

2652
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:21,160
Are these people willfully signing up to be psionic assets

2653
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:23,760
or in certain cases are they being rounded up

2654
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:24,600
against their will?

2655
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,880
They're signing up to my understanding.

2656
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:29,440
This is what I've been told over and over again

2657
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,400
is that they volunteer for it.

2658
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:32,280
Well, they get paid well.

2659
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,120
And if you're in a country

2660
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,240
where you don't get that much money

2661
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:36,560
and you don't get to do anything cutting edge,

2662
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,680
but you have a skillset that could be used

2663
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:41,640
in a, it could be in a positive way.

2664
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,000
Granted, we're not in these programs,

2665
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,120
so we don't understand really what they do.

2666
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:48,400
But if they were to do something that's fun,

2667
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,600
that they put their skills to, they're gonna do it.

2668
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,400
You know, anybody who's got the skills to do that.

2669
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,520
And so you're saying their family

2670
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,120
might be taken along to work as logistics

2671
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:59,280
and maintenance and so forth.

2672
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,240
Potentially, but I can't confirm that because, you know,

2673
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:05,520
I haven't talked to a P3 refugee from, you know,

2674
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,560
that was, oh yeah, my family came with.

2675
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:08,960
No, I've never heard of that.

2676
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:11,920
But then again, I would say it's entirely possible

2677
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,840
if they're gonna take the people

2678
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,680
that are essentially gonna make them money

2679
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,960
or give them technologies, then why not?

2680
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:22,800
Are there gifted and talented education programs in the US

2681
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,360
that work as feeders to legacy UFO program?

2682
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:29,280
That I cannot, I don't know that personally.

2683
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,560
I have heard it from multiple people.

2684
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:34,720
I know people who claim that they were a part of that,

2685
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,440
but I can't personally talk about it

2686
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:37,720
because I have no idea.

2687
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,320
Do you know anything about this?

2688
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:44,240
I only know one individual and that is Jordan,

2689
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:47,080
who has talked about, you know, working on programs

2690
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:49,080
and being in gate programs as a kid.

2691
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:50,320
He's the only individual I know.

2692
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,080
And it was interesting to see him come forward

2693
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,360
with Sky Watchers.

2694
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,440
So I always knew him by his previous suited in Martin.

2695
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:59,240
So I'm interested to hear more from him about that.

2696
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,640
What do you guys think about Aero generally?

2697
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:04,000
This was the All Domain Anomalies Resolution Office.

2698
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,800
I understand it was a front

2699
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,800
for basically sifting through information

2700
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,520
and plucking people to figure out what they know

2701
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,640
and then either trying to shut them up

2702
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:16,080
or just publicly dismiss the person,

2703
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,280
you know, like I did with anybody that testified.

2704
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:21,200
You know, they misconstrued all our stories.

2705
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:24,520
What I understand now is that the director there

2706
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:28,040
is really hell bent on getting the right information.

2707
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,520
Now granted.

2708
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,800
So do you like the, this is John Kozlowski,

2709
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,360
who is formerly of the National Security Administration

2710
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,520
and, or National Security Agency, sorry.

2711
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,680
And before that, you had Kirkpatrick who like,

2712
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:43,320
I don't know, one person in this world who likes,

2713
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:45,360
you know, I think most people think he was sort of.

2714
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,960
Anybody who's associated with them, of course,

2715
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:48,320
are gonna like them because I'm pretty sure

2716
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,200
they're getting paid the same.

2717
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:51,160
But, you know, that's just what it is.

2718
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:53,520
They're gonna stick up for their own guy.

2719
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,440
So most people think, I think Kirkpatrick's

2720
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,480
sort of a bad faith actor.

2721
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,440
And then Kozlowski, the verdict's still out,

2722
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,160
but you think maybe there's hope or.

2723
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,400
From what I've heard from people dealing with him

2724
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,920
on a personal level that he's for the right issue.

2725
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:07,440
Was yet to be seen, but we will see.

2726
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,640
I mean, like I've said, and Jake Stevens said the same thing,

2727
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:10,720
you'll know them by their deeds.

2728
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,240
And if they start doing good things,

2729
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,760
then that could potentially bring us something to good.

2730
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:16,760
But if they start doing things that we're not approving,

2731
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:19,440
or, you know, that is not gonna help

2732
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,520
with what we're trying to do,

2733
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,360
then I would say it's definitely somebody

2734
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:26,280
that we need to consider not even involving, you know?

2735
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:30,840
I think the hardest part is figuring out

2736
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,760
who's gonna be on the right side of history with this.

2737
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:34,920
Yeah.

2738
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:37,920
What do you, like, how do you position yourself now

2739
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,280
to be on the right side of history?

2740
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,280
I mean, clearly just by coming out, in my opinion,

2741
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,280
I think you're showing courage

2742
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:45,240
and on the right side of history.

2743
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:46,520
But on a go-forward basis,

2744
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,720
now that you're kind of implicated in the topic,

2745
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:49,560
how do you position?

2746
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:51,000
I mean, if I had a job around this

2747
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,040
where I could contribute and bring the answers

2748
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:58,560
and basically provide to the public that this is real,

2749
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,240
I would enjoy that.

2750
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,600
It's much more interesting.

2751
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,200
Business-wise, it's always interesting,

2752
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,920
but it ebbs and flows.

2753
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,600
And the fact is this, you know,

2754
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,280
when I have these meetings in D.C.

2755
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:12,560
and with important people, it kind of like,

2756
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:16,400
it always fuels my fire because I get to contribute

2757
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:19,520
in a sense to actually help people understand

2758
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,880
what they should be looking for.

2759
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:24,600
And so when I get invited to partake in those meetings,

2760
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,920
and I was like, okay, this is cool.

2761
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,720
I get to meet very interesting people.

2762
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:31,600
I get to meet people I never think I'd ever meet

2763
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,520
because most people see these people on TV,

2764
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,960
and it's like, oh yeah, there's this person here.

2765
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:37,520
You know, he's part of the administration

2766
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,200
or he's doing this.

2767
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,960
So I think if I can contribute in a sense that's positive,

2768
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:46,000
I think that that's what I can die leaving this earth

2769
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,800
knowing that I tried to help get us somewhere better.

2770
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,760
Because all I want from this is just for us to be better,

2771
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,160
for us to have these technologies

2772
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:56,920
that we could live a lot longer,

2773
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:59,360
we can live happier, we can be healthier,

2774
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,120
and we can be more knowledgeable

2775
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,760
and can be at a higher consciousness.

2776
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:06,240
Do you think that these technologies will ever come out?

2777
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,280
And you know, we'll get-

2778
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:08,120
Some of them are.

2779
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:10,920
There's some rumors and speculation

2780
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,200
from some reputable people.

2781
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,800
I know that that's what they're trying to do.

2782
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,920
And it's more medical-based technologies.

2783
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:17,760
Like what?

2784
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:22,000
So it's scalar technologies, right?

2785
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,320
So this device, essentially all they do

2786
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:27,280
is if you're not there presently,

2787
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,560
they use a photo of you.

2788
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,560
It could just be like a symmetrical photo of your face.

2789
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:33,360
And they did this with my dog, for example,

2790
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:34,560
because he, like I said,

2791
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:37,000
he was diagnosed with some sort of bladder mass

2792
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,080
that they thought was cancerous.

2793
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:40,440
And then this scan,

2794
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:44,680
it hits the body with around 886,000 different frequencies

2795
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:47,600
to up to 1.2 million frequencies.

2796
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:48,440
And then what it does

2797
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:51,320
is when one of those frequencies registers or pings,

2798
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:52,840
that specific ping tells you

2799
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,280
that you have this specific element.

2800
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:56,720
With this specific element,

2801
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:58,720
it also talks about specific frequencies

2802
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:01,120
that can terminate that specific cell.

2803
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,800
And it can do this remotely via a photo.

2804
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:04,640
Correct.

2805
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:07,200
Now the caveat to this is that they could kill people

2806
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:11,000
the same way by manifesting harmful cells

2807
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,560
like fast-testing cancers.

2808
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,200
Does that sound familiar?

2809
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,360
Have you ever heard whistleblowers

2810
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,440
or people trying to come forward

2811
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,480
that got hit with this kind of shit

2812
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,600
to get them to shut up or it kills them pretty quick?

2813
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,840
You might know better than me.

2814
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,040
James Allen, the documentarian of Mark McCandlish

2815
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:26,560
and the Flexliner story.

2816
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:27,760
He was diagnosed and dead

2817
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:30,280
of an aggressive form of cancer in about three weeks.

2818
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:31,960
Do you think that that was caused

2819
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:34,920
by some sort of remote scalar weapon?

2820
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:36,960
I'm more interested in the fact

2821
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,640
his autopsy said he was poisoned with heavy metals.

2822
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:41,560
So that almost sounds more prosaic,

2823
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:43,880
like more like, you know, conventional or something.

2824
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,640
But have you, so you've heard it,

2825
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:48,320
you know specifics of people having hit,

2826
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:49,360
been hit with cancer.

2827
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:50,640
Yeah, but I can't talk about

2828
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:52,280
the people I'm associated with on that

2829
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,120
because I don't wanna-

2830
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:54,560
Okay, that's scary.

2831
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:55,400
It is scary.

2832
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:58,040
The problem is that bullets and stuff like that are archaic.

2833
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,600
They don't need that shit.

2834
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,200
These weapon systems that they have

2835
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,760
that they can turn into weapon systems with scalar

2836
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,560
manifesting growths and cancers into your,

2837
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,920
or they can fuck with your eyesight.

2838
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:09,640
They could fuck with your brain.

2839
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:11,520
You know, that's very real stuff.

2840
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:16,520
So when they are able to use this technology

2841
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:17,640
in a good sense,

2842
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:19,080
there's always gonna be somebody who's bad

2843
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:21,920
who wants to use the same technology in a harmful way,

2844
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,240
which is why it's not public.

2845
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:27,280
And, you know, it's not like these people that use it

2846
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:30,080
that I know that have used it on me are like greedy people,

2847
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,760
but they cure a lot of people.

2848
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,720
And sometimes they cure, I've seen-

2849
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:35,960
So you think that technology is gonna be

2850
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:39,200
these scalar wave healing technologies

2851
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:40,880
might be exfiltrated?

2852
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,600
Well, yeah, there's always a flip side to everything.

2853
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,200
In order to have good, you have to have bad.

2854
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:46,400
This is what people don't understand.

2855
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,040
Nothing's always ever good

2856
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:49,320
and nothing's always ever selling bad.

2857
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:50,480
All tech is dual use.

2858
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,320
Correct.

2859
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:52,160
It's AI.

2860
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:53,000
We'll carve, right?

2861
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,480
We'll go to the store and do this.

2862
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:55,320
Some guy looks at it,

2863
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,880
he's like, you know what, I'm gonna go run over 30 people.

2864
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,280
Yeah, nuclear-free energy or nuclear bomb or, you know.

2865
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,520
It's the same thing with this technology, you know.

2866
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,360
It just depends on what the person wants to utilize it with.

2867
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,240
A knife that can cut food for you

2868
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:08,640
so you don't choke to death

2869
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:11,040
or is the same person who's gonna go think ill of it

2870
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:12,520
and go stab a bunch of people.

2871
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,640
It is interesting when you say like the remote,

2872
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:16,360
there's this guy, Joe Dispenza,

2873
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:19,240
that does like, you know, self-actualization work.

2874
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:20,320
And it's always like, you know,

2875
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:21,960
you have these like remote healings

2876
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:24,320
and like people concentrate on a photo and stuff.

2877
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:27,400
And, you know, I don't know what to make of it.

2878
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:28,560
I don't know what to make it of either,

2879
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:33,560
but I know this device was pretty crazy, but it's great.

2880
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:36,560
And, you know, so the type of frequencies,

2881
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:39,320
so here's the thing that's cool about it.

2882
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:41,120
So the frequencies that it pings,

2883
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,480
and then it suggests, you know,

2884
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:45,800
because it goes down to your DNA,

2885
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:48,000
but then it goes all the way to the atoms

2886
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,080
and molecules that make up your body.

2887
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,680
And then it can also detect things

2888
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:55,520
that haven't manifested yet, and it can curb that.

2889
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:58,320
So for me, for example,

2890
01:45:58,320 --> 01:45:59,880
I didn't tell them my medical history,

2891
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:01,400
but when they did the scan on me,

2892
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:02,640
they found out everything about me

2893
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:03,720
that I never told them.

2894
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:04,560
Really?

2895
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:05,800
And I didn't even know this about myself.

2896
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,360
My dad's, you know, I was born with very thick blood.

2897
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:10,240
And so I needed a transfusion when I was born.

2898
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:12,040
My dad's like, yeah, you've had thick blood ever since.

2899
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:13,560
So that showed up on the scanner.

2900
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:14,400
You showed it too.

2901
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,720
Because the reason why it showed up

2902
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:17,520
because the way that my arteries and veins

2903
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:20,240
are working harder because of having to pump the thick blood.

2904
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:22,080
And then you talked about it with your dad.

2905
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,920
You didn't even know.

2906
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:23,760
I didn't even know.

2907
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,040
He told me, he's like, yeah, well, you know,

2908
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:28,000
I told him, I said, well, they said that I had thick blood.

2909
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
And he says, yeah, you've had thick blood since you were a baby.

2910
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
You had to get a transfusion.

2911
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,600
And that's the reason why my arteries

2912
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,400
and veins and capillaries.

2913
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:37,880
They're definitely like quacky versions of this

2914
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:39,920
that exist commercially right now.

2915
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:42,880
There is, and it's called energy enhancement systems,

2916
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:46,080
which are, you know, so you stand by these screens

2917
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,760
or sit by these screens and the frequencies they hit you with

2918
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:50,760
are supposed to be of healing frequencies.

2919
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:51,840
I have yet to do that.

2920
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,800
I can't say if it's legitimate.

2921
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:57,680
It may be there's people I know that have had that done.

2922
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:00,080
But with this particular device,

2923
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:05,120
it's something that I really hope to God that this comes out.

2924
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:08,560
Because you're saying there is a plan to exfiltrate it

2925
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,440
for commercial use.

2926
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:11,040
Yes, there is.

2927
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:12,840
But then you're getting into something

2928
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:15,200
that's like alternative medicine is what this will fall under

2929
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:18,240
because Western medicine is so heavily involved with FDA

2930
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:21,280
and having to do things regarding that with what they said.

2931
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:24,000
Wouldn't this theoretically take out Big Pharma?

2932
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,560
That's why they don't want to help.

2933
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:27,200
Can you live forever on this thing?

2934
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:28,960
Are there people in the UFO program

2935
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:29,960
who are going to live to 300?

2936
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:33,080
I mean, the person that one of the people that exists today,

2937
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:33,920
and I don't know who they are,

2938
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:36,480
they're probably on the first already part of living forever

2939
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:39,240
in our world right now because of what the technology is.

2940
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:40,600
That is a possibility.

2941
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:42,920
Well, I would love to understand this stuff better

2942
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:46,360
because it seems so prima facie absurd.

2943
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:48,280
But I'm interested in this stuff.

2944
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:52,200
And you can turn molecular mass into frequency.

2945
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:55,960
That's not at all woo-woo to say in physics or biology.

2946
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:59,680
And if you did take almost like a bank

2947
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:01,680
of like this organ should be operating

2948
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:06,160
at whatever optimum frequency, you could probably tune it.

2949
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:09,440
There's a field called cymatics where with vibrations,

2950
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,800
you can create sand structures

2951
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:13,840
in like these vibrational plates.

2952
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,120
And so you could theoretically,

2953
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:18,760
and we know that cellular communication occurs

2954
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:21,680
via voltage gated ion channels.

2955
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:23,920
And so you can, the field,

2956
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:26,000
there is a bioelectric field to everybody.

2957
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,160
These are all sort of facts.

2958
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:29,680
And so theoretically with acoustics

2959
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:31,120
and electromagnetic fields,

2960
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:33,760
you could affect bodily functions.

2961
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:36,600
How you do that in a precise way to heal people,

2962
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:39,480
that feels very hard for me to understand.

2963
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:41,640
Well, it's hard for me to understand

2964
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:44,800
because again, like I said, I was not exposed to this.

2965
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,760
So the first scan took 12, 12 and a half hours.

2966
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,040
I was in this chair and they were sitting there working

2967
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:51,240
like literally overnight.

2968
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:53,200
And you're sure this isn't really good counterintel

2969
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:54,280
like the subway order?

2970
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:56,920
No, this is not a good counterintel.

2971
01:48:56,920 --> 01:49:01,520
This was something that was used on me

2972
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:04,800
in a sense to one, build trust with this particular person,

2973
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,760
but also to understand that this is something that is real

2974
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,720
and it's something that can benefit humanity.

2975
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:11,960
I'm more interested in that.

2976
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,640
I don't, yeah, the UFO stuff's cool because they fly.

2977
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:18,000
The medical shit, the stuff that we could also do

2978
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,280
with this technology is gonna be far more advanced.

2979
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:23,400
Even with consciousness, I mean, that's more mind blowing

2980
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:24,840
than just watching a craft fly.

2981
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:27,480
I'm sorry, but people are so enamored with those.

2982
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:28,880
But it's like, that's the boring part of it.

2983
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,200
Jake's even said the same thing.

2984
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,040
Yeah, totally, yeah.

2985
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:34,920
So the first treatment was 12 hours of hook to this.

2986
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:35,760
So I fell asleep.

2987
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:38,120
They gave me a stem cells in the same process

2988
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:40,480
and exosomes, which was good.

2989
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:43,000
They also took my blood because it was thick.

2990
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,200
So they put it under a microscope to see how thick it is.

2991
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:48,280
It's pretty thick, but being on hormone replacement therapy

2992
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:51,120
and having to do blood dumps and stuff like that

2993
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:52,160
is what I keep up with it.

2994
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:56,000
Plus they told me to take baby aspirin, 81 milligrams

2995
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,960
or micrograms, if you wanna call it that,

2996
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,320
daily to help with it.

2997
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:01,720
So I didn't even know that.

2998
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,160
Instead I had osteoporosis.

2999
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,160
Well, I don't drink milk.

3000
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:05,240
I hate milk, milk.

3001
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:08,200
I mean, I like stuff that has milk like cheese and ice cream,

3002
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:09,440
but it hates me.

3003
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:12,440
Yeah, some days it's worth it, some days it's not.

3004
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:14,320
So it knew that about me.

3005
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:16,600
There's a bunch of other things that it said

3006
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,120
that it was able to detect.

3007
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:20,720
And you've never seen the machine?

3008
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:22,280
I have never seen the machine.

3009
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:26,840
This was last year, late February, early March.

3010
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:29,560
But you felt that it healed your dog

3011
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:30,880
and it healed something with you, too?

3012
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:31,720
It healed something with me.

3013
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:32,560
I had parasites.

3014
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,000
I didn't even know because I started getting

3015
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,240
very bad heartburn.

3016
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:37,480
My stomach, my appetite was shit.

3017
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:38,720
I couldn't eat. Really?

3018
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:39,800
I was wondering what it was.

3019
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,720
I was like, okay, well, I need to take this medication

3020
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:43,320
and it didn't make it any better.

3021
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:45,240
Then when I got the scan and it got rid of the parasites

3022
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:46,880
because it listed three different types.

3023
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,400
And you felt better immediately?

3024
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,440
I felt like I was like 20 years old again.

3025
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:51,280
Whoa.

3026
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,480
And this was happened over a week.

3027
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:55,680
So part of it, so 12 hours was the first one,

3028
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:58,120
roughly six hours, the second one,

3029
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:00,000
and then the destruction sequence that they do

3030
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,080
using these frequencies to target the parasites

3031
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:06,640
and to kill off the bad cells took about four and a half hours.

3032
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,960
What they also do on this device is they program

3033
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,560
purified water because water in itself,

3034
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:12,680
if you look through ancient history,

3035
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:14,040
also is a conductor for the body,

3036
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:16,520
just like anything else in our life.

3037
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,640
So they program this water and then basically

3038
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:21,400
you ingest it twice a day, morning and evening.

3039
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:22,400
There's no medications.

3040
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:23,640
They didn't have to cut me open.

3041
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:24,920
They didn't have to do any of that.

3042
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:27,800
And everything that they scanned me of was resolved.

3043
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:29,280
Can I speak to these people?

3044
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,480
I can get you in touch with these people, yes.

3045
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:33,840
It's only word of mouth, so don't put their information out

3046
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:36,280
if they decree to it, but they'll ask you questions

3047
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:38,440
and they will basically, you know,

3048
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:40,240
they want to know who you are first,

3049
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:41,840
which if you're Jesse Michaels,

3050
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:42,960
everybody knows who you are in this,

3051
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,760
and I'm sure they do too.

3052
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:47,840
So with my dog, like I said, my dad took him to the vet

3053
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,360
because I gave him to my dad when I was competing

3054
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:50,640
because I had a full-time job

3055
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:52,360
and then having to train for a show

3056
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:53,920
which took about four to five hours a day

3057
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,280
on top of a 12, 13 hour job was not fair to my dog.

3058
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:58,840
So I gave him to my dad.

3059
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,120
So my dad took him to the vet

3060
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:01,960
and they said that he had a bladder mass

3061
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:03,800
and it was looking like cancer.

3062
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:07,720
So they're like, yeah, you got to go to an oncologist

3063
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:09,280
to figure out what it is.

3064
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:10,200
He didn't want to do that.

3065
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,320
So I told my dad, I said, hey,

3066
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:14,760
this isn't gonna sound fucking nuts, but hear me out.

3067
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:18,960
So I explained a little bit to him,

3068
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:20,280
at least what he understands.

3069
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:22,880
And so I got in touch with these people and said,

3070
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:25,240
hey, dog's not looking too good.

3071
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:26,720
Can you guys do anything with animals?

3072
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:29,920
And they said, yes, they can do cats and dogs right now

3073
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:30,760
and humans.

3074
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:33,840
They're trying to do other, like bovine, for example,

3075
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,920
or horses is something they may be able to do

3076
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,760
at some point, cause they're always refining.

3077
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,760
And I don't know how they do this.

3078
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,280
So they told me to take a,

3079
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:43,240
so my dad sent me a picture of his face

3080
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:46,600
as a very recent photo.

3081
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:47,560
So I did that.

3082
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:50,760
My dad had told me within a matter of weeks

3083
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:52,600
because I started giving him this other stuff

3084
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,520
that they have, which is like a blue,

3085
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:56,280
is like a nano blue, for example.

3086
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:59,840
So what this blue stuff does is that you ingest it

3087
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,800
and it starts to basically kill all the bacteria

3088
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:03,760
and viruses inside your body.

3089
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,600
So it makes it easier for this treatment

3090
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:08,480
to take effect as well.

3091
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:09,480
So I told my dad, I said,

3092
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:12,080
okay, give him one ML in the morning every day

3093
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,440
and then they're gonna do the treatments.

3094
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,160
So they did about four or five treatments on him.

3095
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:17,560
Said he wasn't looking too good,

3096
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:19,600
but then they started doing the more treatments

3097
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:21,040
and with this blue.

3098
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:25,880
And he was, when he would urinate,

3099
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:28,680
it was very small because his bladder was taken out.

3100
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:30,760
Now he'll sit there forever

3101
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:33,120
just trying to get everything out.

3102
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:35,200
There was no surgery involved.

3103
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:38,480
Like I said, he had cloudy eyes because he's getting old.

3104
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,280
They got rid of all that.

3105
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:42,000
He's like a puppy again.

3106
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
And his appetite is still the same.

3107
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,840
You know, he was, some days he wasn't feeling too good

3108
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:48,320
where he was, didn't wanna move.

3109
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:51,600
I mean, cause he's 13, 14 years old almost.

3110
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:53,560
Now it's a different story.

3111
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:55,520
And knowing that this exists,

3112
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,680
my grandma was basically like my mom to me.

3113
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:00,520
And she raised me.

3114
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:02,040
She ended up dying from pancreatic cancer.

3115
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:04,680
That was the stage where when they found it.

3116
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:07,640
If I could, if I would have known about this,

3117
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:09,960
then somebody like her, I could have had helped

3118
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:11,760
and they could have done something about it.

3119
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:15,760
Now granted, talking about curing cancer is very iffy

3120
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,280
and it also depends on obviously

3121
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,000
what side of the fence you sit on.

3122
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,320
I know from my experience with what it did for me

3123
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:25,360
and what it did for my dog, completely cured us.

3124
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:28,480
I do not doubt that this would be something

3125
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,080
that could help people that are literally losing

3126
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:32,240
their lives over illnesses.

3127
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:35,560
And the reason for not putting this out super publicly,

3128
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:38,440
like right now is the dual use implication?

3129
01:54:38,440 --> 01:54:40,360
Dual use, but also the FDA.

3130
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:44,280
This technology exists with these people.

3131
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,360
It could really be profound and change this,

3132
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:48,280
but you have big pharma that's more interested

3133
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:49,640
in getting this money.

3134
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:51,480
And that's the thing that upset me with COVID

3135
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:53,240
because obviously per diagnosis,

3136
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:54,920
these doctors are getting somewhere

3137
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:57,760
from 16 to 30 grand per fucking diagnosis.

3138
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:59,480
It's like, yeah, so of course there's incentive

3139
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:02,360
for you guys to literally mark everything as COVID.

3140
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:04,000
So anybody in the medical industry,

3141
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,360
if you're gonna do the right thing,

3142
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,880
start thinking on an ethics.

3143
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:09,600
This is the problem with this world today.

3144
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:12,000
It's because of greed, it's because of the incentives

3145
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,880
that people get and it's because people wanna

3146
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:14,840
be selfish about it.

3147
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:16,360
And the overlap in financial interests

3148
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:19,400
between big pharma and big food is extremely high.

3149
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,720
That's why I want RFK to do what he's doing.

3150
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:22,560
I have the same.

3151
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:27,280
Well, I think the FDA governs both food and drugs.

3152
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:30,840
And on the food side, it's extremely laissez-faire and loose.

3153
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:33,960
And so you have all these chemicals that are allowed

3154
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:36,560
in our food, things like glyphosate,

3155
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:40,560
which are probably autoimmune or cancer-causing.

3156
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:44,200
They're like, glyphosate is very close to Agent Orange.

3157
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:45,800
It's just horrible for you.

3158
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:47,720
And we have all these things that are allowed in the US

3159
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:49,480
that are banned in Europe.

3160
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:51,200
And so on that side, on the food side,

3161
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:52,040
we're very laissez-faire.

3162
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:55,680
And then on the drug side, once people get extremely sick

3163
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:57,440
and the big pharma companies are profiting

3164
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:59,840
off of these biochemical solutions

3165
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:02,160
for whatever their ailments are,

3166
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:04,440
it's extremely hard to get new drug innovation

3167
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:05,920
or anything passed through the FDA.

3168
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:08,080
So this side is then super strict.

3169
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:09,920
When you should be throwing the Hail Mary

3170
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,760
because you're already really sick,

3171
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:14,120
the restrictions should be very wide.

3172
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:16,040
It should actually be like, let's try.

3173
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:16,880
Let's try everything.

3174
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:20,960
Electromagnetic, whatever, because sound healing, whatever.

3175
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:23,400
But then, so you can't pass anything by the FDA here.

3176
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:25,840
And then here, everything goes to make you sick.

3177
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:27,560
So it's just completely perverse.

3178
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:28,400
Well, and that's the thing.

3179
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:29,520
So if they're working hand-in-hand

3180
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:32,480
trying to make more patients, because guess what?

3181
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:34,200
A patient cured is a patient lost.

3182
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:35,040
Yeah, totally.

3183
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:35,860
They lose money off that.

3184
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:37,680
So of course, we're gonna keep people sick.

3185
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:40,600
Do you guys think more whistleblowers will come out

3186
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:43,360
and the consensus will shift on this topic?

3187
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:48,120
It feels like even shows like podcasts like Joe Rogan's,

3188
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:50,600
which traditionally have covered this stuff,

3189
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:55,600
I think when it was less activity was involved

3190
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:58,880
and it was easier to make sense of

3191
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:01,440
because there were a few kind of hot button stories

3192
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:03,160
that you either had an opinion on

3193
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:05,360
for, again, those like Bob Lazar or whatever.

3194
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:07,600
And now they're, I think, extremely confused.

3195
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:08,980
They feel like the zone is being flooded.

3196
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:11,360
And my basic understanding,

3197
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:13,000
based on the way he speaks on his podcast,

3198
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:16,320
he's kind of suspicious of the whole thing.

3199
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:17,360
Well, he should be.

3200
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:19,960
I'm not saying every whistleblower's gotta be trusted.

3201
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:21,760
I mean, there's people out there trying to get rich.

3202
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:22,600
I get it.

3203
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:23,800
They're trying to find a livelihood.

3204
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:25,660
If so be it, you're gonna be found out.

3205
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:27,720
But at the same time, yes, be skeptical.

3206
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:30,860
The thing with it too is that

3207
01:57:30,860 --> 01:57:33,040
these people really need to put egos aside.

3208
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:35,920
This is part of the reason why we have this problem.

3209
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:37,280
Everybody on Capitol Hill thinks they know

3210
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:38,720
what the fuck's going on because they're senators

3211
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:39,960
or so-and-so or they're the president

3212
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,240
or they're secretary of defense or all this.

3213
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:44,840
You guys are removable pawns

3214
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:46,880
that are gonna have an expiration of your terms

3215
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:49,040
and they're gonna go living your normal life

3216
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:51,920
and some other person's gonna step into your point.

3217
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:53,320
They're gonna do the same thing you're doing.

3218
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:55,080
So it's really just interchangeable people.

3219
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:57,000
This is a reason why secrecy exists

3220
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,280
because they would rather have people

3221
01:57:58,280 --> 01:58:00,680
who are permanently involved stay at that level

3222
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:03,760
instead of just having somebody interchanged, right?

3223
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:05,520
Two or three terms, you're out.

3224
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:07,840
Or as a president, you're not gonna know much

3225
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:09,920
because you're gonna literally just go out

3226
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:10,740
and do whatever you're gonna do

3227
01:58:10,740 --> 01:58:11,980
after becoming the president.

3228
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:15,140
If there's this sort of shadow government

3229
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:18,860
vis-a-vis these UFO programs, who's the president of that?

3230
01:58:18,860 --> 01:58:19,700
Or is it-

3231
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:20,540
Somebody that nobody knows.

3232
01:58:20,540 --> 01:58:22,300
And it's somebody that has a hell of a bankroll

3233
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:24,820
that nobody could ever understand or imagine.

3234
01:58:24,820 --> 01:58:26,220
And they probably more than likely

3235
01:58:26,220 --> 01:58:27,420
do not live in this country

3236
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:29,140
because if they were smart, they'd be somewhere else.

3237
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:30,620
Do you have any-

3238
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:33,780
Yeah, we hypothesize somebody like Dick Cheney.

3239
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:35,660
Yeah, but he would be-

3240
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:36,940
Top of the pyramid, not-

3241
01:58:36,940 --> 01:58:39,620
Yeah, but Dick Cheney would be the representative

3242
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:41,100
of something else.

3243
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,060
It's gonna be somebody that nobody knows,

3244
01:58:44,060 --> 01:58:46,200
that's never, nobody knows their face,

3245
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:47,820
nobody knows they even exist.

3246
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:49,460
It won't be a politician.

3247
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:52,300
I would wager that maybe 10 to 20 total people

3248
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:53,620
in the world have the full picture

3249
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:55,220
of the UAP legacy program.

3250
01:58:55,220 --> 01:58:56,860
And they got more funding than everybody

3251
01:58:56,860 --> 01:58:58,220
that they could ever imagine.

3252
01:58:58,220 --> 01:59:01,180
I also understand the Joe Rogan orientation towards it

3253
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:04,700
because it's so, the whole, the UAP thing is so weird.

3254
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:07,020
You have on the one hand, like, you know,

3255
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:09,140
this sort of like Tim Taylor, NASA,

3256
01:59:09,620 --> 01:59:11,860
like all this sort of like strange, you know,

3257
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:14,060
summoning stuff around, you know, UFO,

3258
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:17,140
or sorry, around rocketry, like in the history of rocketry.

3259
01:59:17,140 --> 01:59:20,020
And then you have this other stuff of like, you know,

3260
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:23,100
aerospace, black aerospace and like saucers and hangers

3261
01:59:23,100 --> 01:59:25,320
and like nuts and bolts, propulsion updates,

3262
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:26,700
that sort of thing.

3263
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:30,220
And then you have like, what are the NHI themselves

3264
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:31,380
and like the ontology there

3265
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:33,020
and kind of the metaphysical dimension

3266
01:59:33,020 --> 01:59:34,820
of like Jacques Vallee and Diana Pasulka

3267
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:37,100
and like what we're dealing with and is it spiritual?

3268
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:39,340
And it's just extremely confusing.

3269
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:42,740
Well, and I mean, it could be intentionally

3270
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:44,260
provided that it's confused, you know,

3271
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:45,980
or to bring confusion.

3272
01:59:45,980 --> 01:59:48,760
So, I mean, that's kind of where we have to kind of

3273
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:50,460
be very careful to navigate that.

3274
01:59:51,740 --> 01:59:53,260
You only know what you're exposed to.

3275
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:56,000
And then again, whoever is exposed to something

3276
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,940
could be fed misinformation to say,

3277
01:59:57,940 --> 01:59:59,220
hey, go ahead and say this.

3278
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:01,420
Thank God I didn't have that problem, you know.

3279
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:03,300
There was suspicion when Jake approached me

3280
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:05,940
that it was like, okay, maybe this might be the case.

3281
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:09,660
But then he's been very transparent about his role,

3282
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:11,680
you know, being a red team asset pretty much

3283
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:13,100
to try to bump whistleblowers

3284
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:15,340
and figure out who's got what.

3285
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:17,300
And you're sure, you know,

3286
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:20,080
I've got pretty good impression from him in my interview,

3287
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:23,220
but you're sure he's not still, you know, red teaming?

3288
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:25,060
Like, there was this moment in my interview

3289
02:00:25,060 --> 02:00:26,180
where I was like, how do we know

3290
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:28,080
you're not red teaming us right now?

3291
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:30,660
Well, you don't, you don't know that.

3292
02:00:30,660 --> 02:00:31,500
You really don't.

3293
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:32,420
That was an honest answer.

3294
02:00:32,420 --> 02:00:33,860
Yeah, you don't know that.

3295
02:00:33,860 --> 02:00:36,340
And so I, and all I can do,

3296
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:38,140
I expect to get asked that a lot.

3297
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:41,420
It's like, you know, I'll paraphrase a book

3298
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:43,100
from Matthew, I think it is.

3299
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:45,500
Like, you will know me by my fruits.

3300
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:47,860
Well, there's, what does he really have

3301
02:00:47,860 --> 02:00:50,140
to benefit from red teaming if he's public?

3302
02:00:51,740 --> 02:00:53,580
He's out there.

3303
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:55,260
I mean, and not only that, but he...

3304
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:56,580
Well, if I'm playing devil's advocate,

3305
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:59,660
it could be, you know, controlled opposition or, you know.

3306
02:00:59,660 --> 02:01:01,140
For what, though?

3307
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:01,980
I don't, for the program.

3308
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:02,820
Because he's trying to prove the exit.

3309
02:01:02,820 --> 02:01:03,660
For the program.

3310
02:01:04,460 --> 02:01:05,700
Because he's trying to prove this is real.

3311
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:06,940
That's his whole thing.

3312
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:08,860
And he's helping, he's trying to get government

3313
02:01:08,860 --> 02:01:10,860
and institutions to help with that.

3314
02:01:10,860 --> 02:01:13,500
Somebody's not gonna be in a disinformation campaign

3315
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:14,780
just to have government involved.

3316
02:01:14,780 --> 02:01:16,140
And then just to, you know,

3317
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:17,980
everybody's trying to prove it's real.

3318
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:20,020
So is Jake, which we all know it's real.

3319
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:23,220
But in the consensus of the planet,

3320
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:24,700
I think if everybody understood that it was real,

3321
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:27,220
then they'd actually be the first role they can get over.

3322
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:28,620
What do you guys think?

3323
02:01:28,620 --> 02:01:31,140
And, you know, I think that's a very noble aim.

3324
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:34,780
What do you guys think is, like, the disclosure moment?

3325
02:01:34,780 --> 02:01:37,580
Like, because you think, you would think that a guy saying,

3326
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:39,780
I retrieved a UFO would be the disclosure moment.

3327
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:41,660
But that, you know, I think a lot of people,

3328
02:01:41,660 --> 02:01:45,260
like, my video on this guy only has like a half million views

3329
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:47,900
and there are like 350 million people in this country.

3330
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:49,940
And so, you know.

3331
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:52,500
Again, it depends on what side of the fence you sit on.

3332
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:54,180
Some people need disclosure to be something

3333
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:56,180
that they have to witness firsthand.

3334
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:57,700
Nothing wrong with that.

3335
02:01:57,700 --> 02:01:59,580
There's some people that, yes, they can take tidbit

3336
02:01:59,580 --> 02:02:01,820
information that I've provided to say, OK, yeah,

3337
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:03,300
reverse engineered or something.

3338
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:05,140
For me, that was disclosure.

3339
02:02:05,140 --> 02:02:06,900
Yeah, if I saw that thing, hum it.

3340
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:08,220
That was disclosure.

3341
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:09,940
That'd be it, yeah, yeah.

3342
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:11,460
I would have trouble keeping a day job.

3343
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:13,340
Like, you have a couple of businesses.

3344
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:16,220
Like, I'd be like, I'd turn into a fiend,

3345
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:17,620
like, trying to figure out exactly what that is.

3346
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:19,500
Sometimes business gets fucking boring

3347
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:21,460
and then you're like, man, I wonder what's going on over here.

3348
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:22,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3349
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:23,820
Start trying to research into stuff.

3350
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:25,380
I'd spend the rest of my life trying

3351
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:27,100
to take a ride on that thing.

3352
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:29,460
I mean, if that ever happens, I'd be like,

3353
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:35,700
Jesse, don't say anything, but meet me at this point.

3354
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:39,740
I mean, you know, it's up in the air what our future holds.

3355
02:02:39,740 --> 02:02:41,860
It's up to us to create the future.

3356
02:02:41,860 --> 02:02:42,820
That's really what it is.

3357
02:02:42,820 --> 02:02:44,980
Do we want to continue living on the past,

3358
02:02:44,980 --> 02:02:47,660
going the same kind of habits and rituals that people do?

3359
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:49,580
Or do we actually want to evolve and actually

3360
02:02:49,580 --> 02:02:51,580
be a better person at the end of the day

3361
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:53,260
and help change the world?

3362
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:55,140
Disclosure is going to help change the world.

3363
02:02:55,140 --> 02:02:56,860
And hopefully for the better, and that's

3364
02:02:56,860 --> 02:02:58,820
something that's going to be taken astray

3365
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:02,180
and weaponized somehow like it already has been.

3366
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:03,260
Yep, yep.

3367
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:05,460
Is there something about, so it's

3368
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:08,500
the people with psionic assets, when Jake even said this

3369
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:11,780
on my show, where it's like, you know, their diets,

3370
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:15,020
their sense of community, they're being tapped into sort

3371
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:17,220
of, you know, they don't live in this kind of materialist,

3372
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:19,780
reductionist framework where like this stuff is actually

3373
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:21,580
more kind of second nature to them.

3374
02:03:21,580 --> 02:03:23,540
Is there something about the land itself?

3375
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:26,460
Like you think about places like, you know,

3376
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:29,180
Skinwalker Ranch to come to Washington, Sedona.

3377
02:03:29,180 --> 02:03:31,420
People just report like weird stuff.

3378
02:03:31,420 --> 02:03:36,180
Well, some of the first CE5 stuff I've seen

3379
02:03:36,180 --> 02:03:38,220
was in Sedona with Greer's team.

3380
02:03:38,220 --> 02:03:41,780
We were with Demi Lovato and her...

3381
02:03:41,780 --> 02:03:43,380
That's an absurd sentence.

3382
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:44,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

3383
02:03:44,780 --> 02:03:47,060
We were with Demi Lovato and Steven Greer.

3384
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:49,100
She was cool to me, you know, she was cool to me,

3385
02:03:49,100 --> 02:03:52,620
but you know, she's had her troubles just like we all have.

3386
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:54,460
So you can't really hold her accountable for that.

3387
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:55,780
That's her own thing.

3388
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:58,460
But, you know, it was cool to talk to her

3389
02:03:58,460 --> 02:04:02,140
and see what she believes on this subject, you know,

3390
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:04,380
and this reaches everybody, you know what I mean?

3391
02:04:04,380 --> 02:04:07,180
So it's all walks of life coming up to a certain point

3392
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:08,820
to understand that we're acknowledging something

3393
02:04:08,820 --> 02:04:10,780
greater than ourselves.

3394
02:04:10,780 --> 02:04:15,300
You know, so seeing the stuff that happened out there

3395
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:16,980
was pretty wild.

3396
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:18,420
What did happen out there with...

3397
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:19,580
With Salt Orbs?

3398
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:20,420
Steven Greer.

3399
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:23,420
So we went to this, I'm not going to name it

3400
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:25,580
because, you know, just in case she ever goes back here

3401
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:28,060
when people trying to like, you know,

3402
02:04:28,060 --> 02:04:30,580
from what I understand, she comes here routinely.

3403
02:04:30,580 --> 02:04:34,380
But it was a cool place in Sedona.

3404
02:04:34,380 --> 02:04:38,340
And so we ended up setting up a circle in two different parts.

3405
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:41,140
One was off grid, one was at this place.

3406
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:44,940
And so the first night we were there in this off grid place,

3407
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:46,860
just off of a trail road,

3408
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:48,180
nobody knew we were the fuck out there.

3409
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:50,460
And there was like two o'clock in the fucking morning, right?

3410
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:53,580
So I'm sitting there fucking falling asleep, you know,

3411
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:55,620
and I'm having to, you know, drive everybody.

3412
02:04:55,620 --> 02:04:58,140
And at least, you know, unless Greer was doing that,

3413
02:04:58,140 --> 02:05:00,660
but most of the time I was driving us.

3414
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:05,660
So we're sitting there and the way that we are seated

3415
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:10,020
is everybody has a part of the sky that they're looking at

3416
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:11,700
or the surrounding area.

3417
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:14,220
So where I'm facing, I see Greer.

3418
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:15,820
Demi's friend is over here.

3419
02:05:15,820 --> 02:05:17,620
Demi's like right here.

3420
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:23,180
Paula, she's somebody in the UFO field

3421
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:25,620
or something, she's some author, I can't remember her name.

3422
02:05:25,620 --> 02:05:26,460
Paula Harris.

3423
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:28,220
Yeah, Paula Harris, she wrote the Trinity book

3424
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:29,620
with Jacques Vallee, Italian.

3425
02:05:29,620 --> 02:05:31,780
She was there too, she's a good lady.

3426
02:05:31,780 --> 02:05:34,260
She actually lives kind of close to where we live.

3427
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:35,100
Cool.

3428
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:38,780
She was there, Demi's fiance was there,

3429
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:40,340
and then Demi's good friend was there.

3430
02:05:40,340 --> 02:05:41,580
And then Demi's mom was there,

3431
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:43,300
who's very sweet and very cool.

3432
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:45,460
She's very short, but she's a good lady.

3433
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:48,300
Both of, you know, so we're sitting there,

3434
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:50,580
we're seeing orbs, we're seeing, you know,

3435
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:53,060
disc-shaped craft appear in and out.

3436
02:05:53,060 --> 02:05:53,900
Really?

3437
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:54,740
Gold color.

3438
02:05:54,740 --> 02:05:55,580
Wow.

3439
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:58,860
And then I don't know what the hell this was.

3440
02:05:58,860 --> 02:06:00,220
So I was sitting there and then, you know,

3441
02:06:00,220 --> 02:06:02,980
obviously we're way apart from each other.

3442
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:03,820
Yeah.

3443
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:05,380
Something just fucking slaps me

3444
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:07,980
on the side of the, on my side very hard.

3445
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:09,980
It wasn't a fucking animal.

3446
02:06:09,980 --> 02:06:13,900
It wasn't any of them because I'm like observing everything

3447
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:16,260
and they're saying shit's happening behind me.

3448
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:18,340
And I'm like, okay, well, I can't see,

3449
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:19,540
but then I'm trying to stay over here

3450
02:06:19,540 --> 02:06:21,820
to see if there's anything coming on over here.

3451
02:06:21,820 --> 02:06:23,980
And something hit me really hard on the side.

3452
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:24,820
And you don't know what it was?

3453
02:06:24,820 --> 02:06:26,260
I don't know what the fuck it was.

3454
02:06:26,260 --> 02:06:28,740
And was it, does it correlate with a UFO sighting?

3455
02:06:28,740 --> 02:06:29,580
I don't, yeah.

3456
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:31,860
They were saying that there was stuff was behind me and shit,

3457
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:34,580
but then all of a sudden it's sometimes just like hard.

3458
02:06:34,580 --> 02:06:36,260
They were saying stuff was behind you,

3459
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:38,460
like what was behind you?

3460
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:41,660
Orbs, shapes, blue, white color, stuff like that.

3461
02:06:41,660 --> 02:06:42,500
And you just felt something knock into you?

3462
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:44,180
I just felt something literally just like this,

3463
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:46,420
like harder than that on my side.

3464
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:47,500
And it fucking jumped.

3465
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:49,100
I'm like, what the fuck was that?

3466
02:06:49,740 --> 02:06:51,180
So I don't know what it was.

3467
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:54,260
What do you say to the people that say Greer is like,

3468
02:06:54,260 --> 02:06:57,100
I don't know, holographically like displaying stuff?

3469
02:06:57,100 --> 02:06:58,740
Oh, if that's the case,

3470
02:06:58,740 --> 02:07:01,220
sign the fuck up and pay the money because this guy,

3471
02:07:01,220 --> 02:07:05,100
I mean, he, this is what he dedicates his life to.

3472
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:07,860
He gave up his medical career to do this kind of stuff.

3473
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:10,140
So yes, does he need to provide a living?

3474
02:07:10,140 --> 02:07:11,700
I'm pretty sure everybody watching this show,

3475
02:07:11,700 --> 02:07:13,300
if they're interested in UFOs,

3476
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:14,340
they're not gonna do it for free

3477
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:16,020
when they got bills to pay and the families to pay.

3478
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:17,620
But is he faking any of these?

3479
02:07:17,620 --> 02:07:18,980
He is not faking this shit.

3480
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:20,740
There's people who say, oh,

3481
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:24,180
you know how many op-eds are against Greer publicly

3482
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:26,300
to say that this stuff isn't real

3483
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:28,900
that are a part of these programs trying to say it's not?

3484
02:07:28,900 --> 02:07:30,140
Interesting.

3485
02:07:30,140 --> 02:07:33,820
With any other final things or what you wanna add?

3486
02:07:33,820 --> 02:07:35,420
Well, you know, and it's just, you know,

3487
02:07:35,420 --> 02:07:36,780
I want people to keep an open mind,

3488
02:07:36,780 --> 02:07:39,420
but I don't want people to understand that,

3489
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:41,940
you know, whatever side of the field you're gonna be on,

3490
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:44,540
just understand that we're trying to get something done here

3491
02:07:44,540 --> 02:07:47,140
and it's gonna happen with or without everybody.

3492
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:48,940
If they wanna help and support, great.

3493
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:51,300
If not, stay the fuck out of our way.

3494
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:53,540
We'll handle it ourselves, like we've been doing.

3495
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:55,820
Anything?

3496
02:07:55,820 --> 02:07:56,860
I don't think so.

3497
02:07:56,860 --> 02:07:58,620
Okay, Michael, this is an honor, man.

3498
02:07:58,620 --> 02:08:00,140
I appreciate you taking the time.

3499
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:00,980
This is a blast.
