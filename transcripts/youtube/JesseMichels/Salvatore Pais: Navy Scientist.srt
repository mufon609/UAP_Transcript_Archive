1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
I truly think that one day we must unite the factions

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,160
because I think one day we shall have an external enemy.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,200
And by external enemy, I mean very external.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,160
NHI.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,360
Think of the Earth.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,720
We are a very yummy apple.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,800
I think remote action is possible.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,680
Can you imagine stopping at heart just by thinking about it?

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,040
Say, from Qatar.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,560
That's some scary shit.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,240
You have spoken publicly with these MH370 videos

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,440
and it seemed like the civilian aircraft just disappeared

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,600
in the Southeast Asian territory.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,800
The most complex of problems has the simplest of solutions

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,640
depending on perspective.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,560
When I saw that thing open up,

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,400
I saw the Pais effect in action.

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,240
This is the Pais effect, come and go.

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,080
So we're talking about artificial singularity.

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,920
Different parts of the brain have different activity rules.

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,960
But you know that, don't you?

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,840
We're the people that you grew up with.

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
Maybe you should interview me.

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,880
So excited to be here.

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
This has been a long time coming

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,200
because I've consumed a lot of your content.

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,160
Before we get into our guest today,

28
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,240
I want to present our co-host,

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,600
the esteemed pseudonymously named Jack.

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,200
He has to go under a pseudonym.

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,120
He works in some sensitive areas,

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,880
but he is very familiar with some of these

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,560
heterodox scientific frameworks.

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,840
And so I'll allow my interview with Hal Puthoff

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,800
and Eric Weinstein.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,120
Sometimes I get out of my depth scientifically,

37
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,880
and I definitely am with Sal Pais.

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,000
And so I'm very excited to have Jack here.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,960
Thank you for joining us.

40
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, thrilled to be here.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,480
Thank you.

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
What are you wearing for Sal?

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,320
I thought I'd give a little props

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,600
to a very successful organization,

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
eponymously known as Skunk Works.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,840
So thank you for your service.

47
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,320
There you go.

48
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,560
And we have an amazing Navy scientist

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,600
who has sent shockwaves in kind of the UFO world.

50
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,240
It's interesting.

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,040
In 2017, you had revelations around

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,160
the existence of UFO study groups and stuff,

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,000
ATIP, ASAP, that sort of thing.

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,560
But you also had these patents

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,040
that were filed by a guy who was right here

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,520
named Sal Pais, which touched on

57
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,200
some very interesting subjects.

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,840
One might even say that they seem to dovetail

59
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,600
with how you might build a UFO.

60
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,560
And we have a hat right here,

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,800
which he's offered me at the beginning of the show,

62
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,920
which is very nice.

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,120
It's an F-35 hat.

64
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,920
So thank you, Sal.

65
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,800
Thank you for being here.

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
You're very welcome, my friend.

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,280
You're very welcome.

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,400
And never remember as far as how Puthoff,

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,760
as far as Eric Weinstein and Jack here.

70
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,240
Trust me, you are at that level.

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,520
You're able to trust me on this.

72
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,240
I've seen many podcasts and you're one of the best.

73
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,520
So absolutely.

74
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,080
Well, we can-

75
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,120
Kudos to you, brother.

76
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,000
Agreed and disagreed.

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,840
But I'm happy to be the last mile

78
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,400
of kind of cogent distribution

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,720
on deeper people like yourself.

80
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,920
So do you have any kind of disclaimers at the top?

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,960
Because you are very sensitive areas as well.

82
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,120
And I want to make sure we don't get any tripwires.

83
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,760
Let me see right off the bat with...

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,320
Yes, my name is Salvatore Cesar Pais.

85
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,440
I work for the United States Navy.

86
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,400
I used to work for the United States Space Force.

87
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,560
Let me say at this time that I come on this podcast

88
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,160
as a private citizen.

89
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,040
And my opinion, my statements, everything I say,

90
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,960
I have said is my own.

91
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,160
The Navy and the Space Force are now responsible

92
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,480
for any of these statements whatsoever.

93
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,480
And also I would like to say that I'm not on this program,

94
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,880
on this podcast to be cubed.

95
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,080
In other words, to enlighten and educate the enemy.

96
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,280
So certain things that I think certain subject matter

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,480
that we may touch upon,

98
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
if it deals with certain frequency...

99
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,640
Jack, you know this well.

100
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,400
We keep numbers out of play and certain things that...

101
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,880
If you, for example, see me slip,

102
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,840
please, Aurelien, guide me accordingly.

103
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,240
Yeah.

104
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,120
Before we dive into today's amazing episode

105
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,760
of American Alchemy, I want to thank Aura

106
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,160
for being the amazing sponsor of this show.

107
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,640
Have you ever Googled yourself or maybe a friend

108
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,240
and been totally freaked out

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,400
by how much personal info popped up?

110
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,200
I did it once and saw old addresses, phone numbers,

111
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,280
stuff I didn't even realize was out there.

112
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,640
Honestly, it made me wonder who else could see all of that.

113
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,920
In 2024, there were multiple high-level data breaches,

114
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,960
including a breach of the National Public Database.

115
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,640
The incident compromised over 2.9 billion records

116
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,320
used for background checks,

117
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,480
including critical personal information,

118
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,080
such as full names, addresses, dates of birth,

119
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,240
phone numbers, and most importantly,

120
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
social security numbers.

121
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
Their data broker opt-out tool

122
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,800
goes after those shady sites that scrape and sell your info.

123
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,880
So you're less of a sitting duck for scammers.

124
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,720
Plus, Aura provides identity theft protection,

125
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,040
monitoring billions of data points,

126
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,040
everything from your social security number

127
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,680
to your bank info, and lets you know fast

128
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,520
if something suspicious shows up.

129
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,240
If the worst happens, each adult on your plan

130
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,680
gets $1 million in identity theft insurance,

131
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,720
up to $5 million total if you have five adults.

132
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
Aura also has other great features,

133
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,040
like a VPN and antivirus,

134
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,320
that all come bundled in an easy-to-use app.

135
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,040
I'm not leaving my data out there for anyone to grab,

136
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,320
and you shouldn't either.

137
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,960
The best part is I get all of this in one app

138
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,320
at an affordable price.

139
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,240
I'm not leaving myself and my family

140
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,480
vulnerable to data breaches and brokers.

141
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,920
And if you don't want to either,

142
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,280
you can go to aura.com slash Jesse Michaels,

143
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,560
Michaels with no A, to try two weeks for free.

144
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
That should be enough time for Aura to find out

145
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,520
if any of your personal data is exposed

146
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,320
and for you to realize that Aura is a no-brainer.

147
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,200
As Dave Grush said,

148
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,120
we're not here to help the adversary do their job.

149
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,000
Absolutely.

150
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,320
Mr. Grush is 100%.

151
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Correctly.

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,240
But, simultaneous to that,

153
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
it's actually a national security risk.

154
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,120
It's actually extremely intelligent STEM students

155
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,080
growing up in the wrong frameworks

156
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
and not being privy to any of this stuff

157
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,440
and thinking it's all factory,

158
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,600
that seems like actually a matter of national security risk.

159
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,240
Yes.

160
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,640
It's an absolutely broken paradigm, you're right.

161
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,680
And it's something that has wheedled its way

162
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
inside the R&D framework

163
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,080
of our national defense infrastructure.

164
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,600
And it's kneecapped us from making critical advances

165
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,440
that have national security implications.

166
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,960
I want to start with the kind of autobiographical,

167
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,920
because it's interesting.

168
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,200
You go on all these podcasts

169
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,320
and you talk about the science

170
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,600
and I want to get into the science

171
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,880
and I think Jack can help kind of

172
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,320
drive some of the conversation later.

173
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,080
But, who are you?

174
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,520
Where are you from?

175
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
How did you get into this stuff?

176
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,560
Oh, wow.

177
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,400
Origins?

178
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,880
Yeah.

179
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,440
All right.

180
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,560
My name is Salvatore Cesar Pais.

181
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,280
That's the way you pronounce it in Romanian.

182
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,440
I was born in Romania, in Bucharest, Romania,

183
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,080
as a matter of fact, capital of Romania.

184
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,680
I came here when I was about 13 and a half of age,

185
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,040
going to New York City,

186
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,280
Queen's Boy, as they say,

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,960
still seek coffee and other things as well.

188
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,640
Love a New York Reuben.

189
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,960
Oh my God, you know, from Brooklyn, Delhi,

190
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,400
a real Reuben.

191
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,720
Anyway, I'm not going to,

192
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,640
I'm going to keep it nice,

193
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
since this is a family show, so it's,

194
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,960
right?

195
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
Every now and then I let it slip.

196
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,320
The people that know me know

197
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,840
that almost every other word,

198
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,720
the real Salvatore will use STF words.

199
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
So every now or like you would not believe.

200
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,600
I can weave a tapestry of obscenities second to none.

201
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,760
Took that from a Christmas story,

202
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,280
but hey, you know, every now and then

203
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,720
you don't have to be an original.

204
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
So, yeah.

205
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
So again, I was born in Romania.

206
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,960
I came here as a young kid.

207
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,480
I grew up in the public education system.

208
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,840
I went to Brooklyn.

209
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,480
In Brooklyn,

210
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,080
to one of the well-known high schools there

211
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,400
was Brooklyn Technical High School.

212
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,480
Not as on the same level as Bronx High School of Science

213
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,320
or Stuyvesant in Manhattan,

214
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,960
but from a technical point of view,

215
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,920
it was very well known and very well liked.

216
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,760
And then I went to Case Western Reserve University

217
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,200
in Cleveland, Ohio.

218
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
No, it's not a military school.

219
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,960
It's actually very highly accredited.

220
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,920
It usually makes the US News top 50 universities.

221
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,800
Almost every year.

222
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,280
And I love my CWR.

223
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,960
I would never exchange it, for example,

224
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,760
going to MIT or any other school.

225
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,320
It's just, I was brought up there and I stayed there.

226
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,880
I did my graduate studies there.

227
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,800
Then I was extremely fortunate to have,

228
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
how should I say, a job at Northrop Grumman.

229
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Well, before then I had a couple of stints in New York

230
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,280
Electronic Systems Associates, CISC and Hennessy.

231
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,520
But I was extremely fortunate to work

232
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,760
for Northrop Grumman Corporation and Advanced Systems,

233
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,120
Advanced Concepts, and one of the other things.

234
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,760
And then I transitioned to the USPTO.

235
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,080
And at the time it was Alexandria, Virginia.

236
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,760
They had moved from Crystal City.

237
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:05,440
And then I was fortunate enough to come here, now there.

238
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,720
And then certain things occurred.

239
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,640
And I was fortunate to work for strategic systems programs

240
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,320
at the Washington Navy Yard.

241
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,080
And then I went for the Space Force and then came back.

242
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,600
And so in 2017, you're probably most known for these patents.

243
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,480
The title of the patent just says a lot.

244
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,640
Hybrid craft using an inertial mass modification device.

245
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,680
How does one even get into a topic like that?

246
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,800
I was very interested.

247
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,120
I've seen certain things as far as

248
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,640
what has been shown on certain documentaries.

249
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,680
Any documentaries or Denzi Convention?

250
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,640
It was a lot of things that were done by Dr. Stephen Greer.

251
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,640
And a great deal of things.

252
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,320
As a matter of fact, I hold a man in very high esteem.

253
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,080
I feel it's very unfortunate that the UFO field seems to be so divided.

254
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,440
It's almost as divided as the country is at this point in time.

255
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,160
And I wish people were more unified.

256
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,360
I've always been a person that drives toward unification.

257
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
Unification of concepts, ideas.

258
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,600
You can always work things out.

259
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,520
You can always reach a compromise.

260
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,000
Always.

261
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,880
And I think everybody benefits as a result.

262
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
The alternative is the enemy wins.

263
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,400
When we fight amongst each other,

264
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,120
our strength is divided, is weakened.

265
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,880
The enemy will always take force, take strength from that.

266
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,200
So you're watching close encounters of the Fifth Column or Unacknowledged.

267
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,160
Things like that.

268
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,880
Absolutely.

269
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,360
How do these crafts operate?

270
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,160
How do they work?

271
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,040
How do they word?

272
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,840
And then it works.

273
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,040
So this patent is somewhat you kind of reverse engineering it.

274
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,160
How you think they work based on the observables and these sorts of concepts.

275
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,400
The whole idea is it can't all be Newtonian propulsion.

276
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,680
You basically take something, you throw it out the back and the thing moves forwards.

277
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:32,240
The whole idea of the Newtonian third law of action-reaction can't all be Newtonian.

278
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
What if there's non-Newtonian propulsion?

279
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,600
So in other words, can we do something to the field that we operate in,

280
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,840
the gravitational field, for example, to make objects have diminished inertia?

281
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,360
Since inertial mass and gravitational mass, after all, there is equivalence between them.

282
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,800
So I have a dumb question.

283
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,960
You publish a thing like this and it seems like pretty well synthesized and researched.

284
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,720
Presumably, there are legacy programs.

285
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,360
If you believe David Gresh for reverse engineering this stuff,

286
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,200
why don't they immediately kind of hit you up?

287
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,680
No idea whatsoever.

288
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,880
As a matter of fact, at one point in time, I almost expected to be contacted,

289
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,920
so then the idea almost occurred to me, almost instantaneously,

290
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
that they must have this somewhere.

291
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,360
They've already started to use it.

292
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,720
They have figured it out and they're already operating certain devices.

293
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,400
Then I hear these things about the reverse engineering craft and then that thing bothers me

294
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,400
because everything I've done is really based on Oliver Heaviside's

295
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,720
version of Maxwell's equation.

296
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,840
The four equations, four unknowns that electrical engineers have grown up to love and use,

297
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,000
thank God, because the original were an absolute trance, extremely.

298
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,600
An unusual, yeah, unusable mass.

299
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,560
Quaternion, formalism, my goodness.

300
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,560
Again, the genius of Oliver Heaviside.

301
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,360
All you do, couple it with the harmonic oscillator and certain things occur

302
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,280
based again on resonance.

303
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,000
Resonance is extremely important because it talks to energy amplification.

304
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,720
You're implying that you don't believe in the E.T. and the craft hypothesis.

305
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,480
You think this is all sort of inmate?

306
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,360
Or do you think you've just stumbled across the same physics of operation?

307
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,600
I believe that there's man-made tech and there's E.T. tech.

308
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,160
It's possible the E.T. tech was reverse engineered from gifts or craft that were found,

309
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,760
historical items, who knows where and how.

310
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,320
There's another avenue.

311
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,760
There's man-made tech.

312
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,920
Why can we have that kind of acumen, that kind of mind?

313
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,040
You mean only these, they're called non-human?

314
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,640
Non-human intelligence.

315
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Only NHIs can have this kind of intellect.

316
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,320
Why can we?

317
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,360
I mean, we should take pride in who we are as homo sapiens sapiens.

318
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,320
We represent a certain intellect.

319
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,600
And this is an interesting question.

320
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,400
Are there multiple branches, multiple tech trees that could be

321
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,080
filtering their way through the defense intelligence base?

322
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:32,800
Some of them approachably nuts and bolts-ish from a technology that's a couple of hundred

323
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,000
years more advanced than us.

324
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,480
And then other examples that are far more exotic, that when you open them up, you see

325
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,360
nothing familiar.

326
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
You see nothing recognizable.

327
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,920
Absolutely.

328
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,960
So in other words, there's man-made tech and E.T. tech.

329
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,720
And I think you can tell them apart.

330
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,160
The one thing that struck me based on what I came to understand from the idea of the

331
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,040
super force, if you take the gravitational field equations of Einstein, you can readily

332
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:08,800
deduce that the super force acting on the spatial temporal geometric structure, what

333
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:16,320
we understand as a quantum vacuum locally, can actually give birth, generate energy density.

334
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,560
Right.

335
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,840
This is the idea of Robert Wheeler, the notion that energy density determines the shape of

336
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,760
space time or the shape of the quantum vacuum.

337
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,640
And the quantum vacuum determines the propagation of that energy.

338
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,840
And the super force equation, which is really a re-rendering of the Einstein gravitational

339
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,000
field equations, talks to this.

340
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,400
And then Bob Lazar mentioned at one point that it seemed to him that the so-called sports

341
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:51,120
model was grown out of the vacuum itself, absolutely smooth, like a 3D printing out

342
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,880
of the space-time fabric itself.

343
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,680
The super force speaks to that directly.

344
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,360
Are you from the Ken Shoulders work?

345
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,880
Exactly.

346
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,160
Vacuum objects, I've read certain papers as well.

347
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,280
It's very interesting, this idea of the vehicle being 3D printed out of the quantum vacuum,

348
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,720
because we can't seem to quite understand exactly.

349
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,640
Because when you talk about chemical vapor deposition, the manufacturing techniques

350
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,680
associated with making very small nanostructured hetero lattices.

351
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,400
My graduate work, for instance, is in topological material physics.

352
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,320
We do know more than is generally acknowledged about how to manufacture those lattices.

353
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,880
But we don't have a lot of control over where exactly the atoms go.

354
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,760
We just spit them out, and physics takes over.

355
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,720
And it deposits them where it wants to deposit them in the lattice.

356
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,400
So if you need them to be in extremely specific lattice points, and then you need to do layer

357
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,440
after layer after layer to get these really novel behaviors, topological superconducting layers,

358
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,000
topological insulative layers, Josephson junctions, and then one after the other,

359
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,080
we don't know how to do that.

360
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,920
So does that get 3D printed somehow?

361
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,320
Okay, well, I want to get in deep quick.

362
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,480
I want to just, for the mass audience, kind of lay some scaffolding, lay the groundwork.

363
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,160
So you mentioned Heaviside.

364
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,520
Most people now, when it comes to kind of classical electrodynamics,

365
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,160
go off of Oliver Heavisides and simplification of Maxwell's equation.

366
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,120
Absolutely.

367
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,760
So where is conventional classical electrodynamics off where you think you've found

368
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,640
kind of a different branch of Heaviside?

369
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,800
Because most people adhere to him, right?

370
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,560
This is not anything new.

371
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,760
This is not new physics.

372
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,440
This is a new perspective on all physics.

373
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,200
All I've done was taken the Heaviside version of Maxwell's equation,

374
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,040
coupled them with a harmonic oscillator, and shown that you get nonlinearity with respect

375
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,240
to the angular frequency, either vibration and or spin, because, as you well know,

376
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,200
the mathematics is heavily similar, and come up with, under certain conditions,

377
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,000
you get resonance conditions, energy amplification.

378
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,680
Emergent phenomena that are not immediately obvious under normal circumstances.

379
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,120
So let's break it down.

380
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,560
What is a harmonic oscillator?

381
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,680
Harmonic oscillator, if you think of, the best way to describe it is from Hooke's law,

382
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,200
the whole idea of f equal minus k x.

383
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,680
A spring.

384
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,960
Exactly.

385
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,080
A spring oscillator that makes the sinusoid n x, y.

386
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,800
Yes, sir.

387
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:35,680
And then you just write, as you well know from Newton's second law, an acceleration, or m d

388
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:46,320
x double prime d t square, the whole idea of n a equal this minus k x.

389
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,720
From that results your harmonic oscillator.

390
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,120
So we're talking about derivatives from differential calculus,

391
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,520
and this is how you go from y equals k x, Hooke's law.

392
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,720
Extremely simple stuff.

393
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,040
For you, combining that concept with Heaviside.

394
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,040
From there, from what happens is from a simple scalar, as a matter of fact,

395
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:13,280
I send you what we presented to the patent examiner, and you can have that with a podcast.

396
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,560
You can actually, sure, absolutely.

397
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,080
That's been already presented.

398
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,480
It's in the public domain, so it's considered non-governmental.

399
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,800
Unclassified.

400
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,520
Unclassified.

401
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,000
Domain.

402
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,560
That's it.

403
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,000
It's public domain.

404
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,920
Since the USPTO primary examiner, a gentleman by the name of Philip Bonzell,

405
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
has put it into the public domain.

406
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,240
It was given to him via phone conversation.

407
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:51,680
So that particular PDF was sent to him, and then we had a phone conversation with

408
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:00,880
the now there attorney, Mr. Mark Lute, which, by the way, was tremendous.

409
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,960
And every one of the five patent applications, mind you, three of them became patents.

410
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,920
The two that did not become patents are the ones that seem to be most mundane.

411
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,840
The high frequency gravitational wave generator became a patent.

412
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,200
The high energy electromagnetic field generator became a patent.

413
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,280
The most exotic concepts.

414
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,760
Using an inertial mass reduction device became a patent.

415
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,840
After some doing, of course, Mr. Philip Bonzell was extremely in awe of that.

416
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,440
He said, this is not possible.

417
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,920
Neutron stars cannot produce these electric fields and magnetic fields.

418
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,000
We're talking about electric fields on the order of 10 to the 18 volts per meter.

419
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,760
How do we get to that?

420
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,560
If you're combining the harmonic oscillator with the heavy side stuff,

421
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,680
how do you get to that big of electric field size?

422
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,720
Again, it is in that PDF, and you can follow the math.

423
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,480
It's extremely simple.

424
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,400
But the whole idea is that you get, from the scaling analysis,

425
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,920
you get a simple relationship that shows that it must be correct,

426
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,360
because the electric field, that relationship, it gives you a relationship.

427
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,800
The scaling analysis of the heavy side version,

428
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,840
I'm actually giving you a relationship,

429
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,800
a simple relationship for the electric field strength E,

430
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,960
and also one for the magnetic induction,

431
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,480
otherwise known as the magnetic flux density, also known as the B field.

432
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:40,720
From those two relationships, you can actually see that E max divided by B max equals C,

433
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,600
equals the speed of light, exactly what Maxwell showed, the whole idea.

434
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,080
That must be correct.

435
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,680
When you couple the harmonic oscillator within those two relationships,

436
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,560
you get something for the B field, which is amazing.

437
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,840
It shows variance with respect to angular frequency squared.

438
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,080
That's interesting.

439
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,640
Now I'm tracking, because in your patent,

440
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,240
you use microwaves inside the annular channel.

441
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,160
To vibrate.

442
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,520
Yes, to vibrate the atoms.

443
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,400
You call it a confined photoelectric effect.

444
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,840
That's exactly what it is.

445
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,720
What I found interesting is the high-temperature superconductor patent is necessary for the

446
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,240
high-frequency gravity wave patent.

447
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,600
They speak to each other.

448
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,160
Because there's a high Q factor associated with the high-temperature superconductor.

449
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,640
For some reason, the patent examiner did not even take that into consideration.

450
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:36,960
Sure.

451
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,200
Exactly what you said, because then just by that simple argument,

452
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,080
from an enablement point of view, he should have passed,

453
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,400
or they should have passed the wrong temperature superconductor.

454
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,600
So what allows that frequency to-

455
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,080
Dr. Victor Lacno, Russian of the Russian Academy of Sciences,

456
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,040
actually shows in his archive published paper.

457
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,120
I've never been able to publish an archive.

458
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,760
So the man must have either known some moderators.

459
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,320
Again, he showed that my room temperature superconductor,

460
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,720
from a mechanism point of view, could work.

461
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,560
And yet, the patent examiner just refused to grant the patent.

462
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,480
So it was an incredible idea.

463
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,880
Because you describe what is a proximity superconductor,

464
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,840
probably also a topological superconductor.

465
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,800
From someone that actually has that knowledge.

466
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,520
Thank you, Jack.

467
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,840
Yeah.

468
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,520
So again, cased in a ceramic.

469
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,400
And so it's the interfacial layer that is superconducting.

470
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,760
That's where the current moves.

471
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,640
And so when you've got these 100 terahertz microwaves

472
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,200
inside the annular channel of your triangle patent,

473
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,480
it's exciting.

474
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,560
And you're setting up that standing wave.

475
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,840
And that's the-

476
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,880
That's what it's all about.

477
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,280
Resonance.

478
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,920
The W squared term is why this blows up.

479
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,320
That amazing square is very important.

480
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,400
And for some reason, people refuse to see

481
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
that mathematics speaks to the physics.

482
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,800
Are you worried at all about that huge B field

483
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,040
and the surviving materials surviving it?

484
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,280
Because-

485
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,200
That's something we have to be aware of.

486
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,360
And the ninth Tesla fields, you know.

487
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,600
As you well know, you have to be extremely careful.

488
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,600
Because usually when you go above even about 10 to the second,

489
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,640
maybe even pushing 10 to the third Tesla,

490
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,640
we're talking about tremendous yields on the-

491
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,720
B field is a magnetic field measured in Tesla.

492
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,680
We've never made a magnetic field any larger than 30 Tesla?

493
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,320
40 Tesla?

494
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,880
Usually.

495
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,760
I heard of something up to 120 Tesla.

496
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,200
But that's a rumor.

497
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,440
Yeah.

498
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,400
And the Earth's magnetic field is like a thousandth of a Tesla.

499
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,680
Or 10,000th of a Tesla.

500
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,960
How would you insulate materials from that size of magnetic field?

501
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,520
You wouldn't.

502
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,000
Simple.

503
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,040
You wouldn't insulate it.

504
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,680
You would have to-

505
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,040
You'd use something that-

506
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,600
This would all want to be synergistic.

507
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,960
So you would want to use something that benefits in some way

508
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,760
from exposure to that field rather than trying to fight physics.

509
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,400
I think that's where really brilliant engineering comes in

510
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,800
is that you're not going to put a bunch of things together

511
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,520
that are parasitically affecting each other in negative ways.

512
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,880
And you're trying to finagle your design space to make it work.

513
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,480
You'd put a bunch of things together

514
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,360
that actually help each other work better with their side effects.

515
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,200
Physics is not enough.

516
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,040
The engineering of the physics trumps everything else.

517
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,480
Again, experiment trumps theory every time.

518
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,560
And I believe trumps should become a verb.

519
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,480
Have you worked on this from an engineering perspective at all?

520
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,000
Or is it purely theoretical?

521
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,720
We worked on a high-energy electromagnetic field

522
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,680
generated experiment at NAVAIR.

523
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,040
However, we weren't able to obtain a charge,

524
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,640
an electrical charge of more than 10 to the minus 8 Coulombs.

525
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,960
We need at least one Coulomb to show that the Pais effect is correct.

526
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,680
I call it the Pais effect not out of hubris,

527
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,640
as people would choose to call it,

528
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,280
but because it was something purely original.

529
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,560
And I decided, why not?

530
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,080
Let's call it something that's never been called before.

531
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,680
And there was one other Pais there, Abraham Pais.

532
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
The autobiographer of Einstein himself,

533
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,640
a great physicist of his own right, said, okay, let's couple the names.

534
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,720
In the context of all we've talked about,

535
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,560
would you step through your explanation of the Pais effect from a high level?

536
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,200
Absolutely.

537
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,480
Usually, I define it as controlled motion of electrically charged mode.

538
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,080
Of electrically charged objects, usually from solids to plasma

539
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,160
based on accelerated vibration and or accelerated spin,

540
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,160
giving rise to extremely high energy densities.

541
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,200
Hence, electromagnetic energy fluxes.

542
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,520
However, it can also be thought of as the production,

543
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,480
the generation of high energy densities

544
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:09,200
based on certain vibratory fields of plasmas, cold plasmas.

545
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,440
We're talking about plasmas that have been driven far from equilibrium.

546
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,640
Your xenon gas and the annulus that you kind of move it back and forth

547
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,360
with your 100 terahertz alternating electric field.

548
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,400
The terahertz frequency is an interesting field that should be looked into.

549
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,920
But again, we're not here to educate and enlighten the enemy,

550
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,520
so that's as far as I go.

551
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,200
Well, it is interesting how Padov has talked about these kind of micron layers,

552
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,400
magnesium bismuth, and he says that they microsize waveguides for terahertz.

553
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,920
There's a reason.

554
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:51,360
Look into the slide presentation that I presented at the 2019 AIAA SciTech.

555
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,320
That presentation, please also post that in your podcast

556
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,440
along with the patent examiner interview, those slides.

557
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:08,960
It makes a lot of sense, but look very carefully, slides four to slides nine

558
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,760
in that particular presentation, and you'll see why the terahertz frequency is so important.

559
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,920
It speaks something that Dr. Eric W. Davis published

560
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,760
in one of those DIA reports that I sold in Televoltage.

561
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,000
More to do with a certain macro dimension.

562
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,080
A fifth dimension?

563
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,920
A fifth dimension.

564
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,480
Right.

565
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:43,760
There's a coupling factor between the electric field that you're setting up

566
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,120
to generate high-frequency gravity waves and this oscillatory behavior of the particles,

567
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:58,000
which potentially polarizes the quantum vacuum and allows you—the analogy that I have used is,

568
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,040
imagine you have a Ziploc bag that's full of water, but it's kind of sloppy,

569
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,200
and you imagine you can push on it on one side and you set up a pressure gradient.

570
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,160
Now you have the quantum vacuum doing work for you

571
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,800
and pushing on you with its own pressure.

572
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,400
It has such a tremendous energy density, like 10 to the 44th

573
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,280
calories per cubic centimeter or something, bananas,

574
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,200
that it does an incredible amount of work.

575
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,880
Literally, this is based on metric.

576
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,280
It's using quantum electrodynamics, even Feynman would say, or whatever,

577
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,800
zero point is full of energy.

578
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,800
Hal Pudoff talks a lot about polarizable bag, that you can electrically polarize,

579
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,480
and so it's using a kind of creating a gradient, basically, to propel an object.

580
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,440
Some of your work has cited Max Born, Paul Dirac.

581
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,280
I talk more to the swing element, breaking the swing element.

582
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,040
Why do I talk about that?

583
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,840
Not just because I want to make black holes, but the whole idea is that

584
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,000
when you put more and more energy into a particular space-time locality,

585
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,200
you can actually unravel what we understand as continuum,

586
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,040
space-time continuum within that quantum vacuum limit.

587
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,880
The swinging limit, really, this whole idea of generational particle,

588
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,800
antiparticle fields, this is exactly what the swinging limit needs.

589
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,200
It's on the order of 10 to the 33 watts per meter square speaking,

590
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,280
corresponding to an energy density on the order of 10 to the 25 joules per meter cubed.

591
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,560
Enormous amounts of energy.

592
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,360
Enormous.

593
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,400
Speaking again to those electric field strength of 10 to the 18 volts per meter,

594
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,360
commensurate to the B field on the order of 10 to the 9 volts per meter again.

595
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,040
What is the swing limit?

596
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,680
The swing limit truly, it represents how much energy density the

597
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,760
quantum vacuum or rather space-time fabric can withstand before it breaks apart.

598
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,600
How does this impact the black hole information limit?

599
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,360
You've talked about this.

600
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,360
I've never looked too much into the information loss paradox.

601
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,320
Summarize what he said.

602
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,700
Sure.

603
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,000
So basically, what you're saying is you're using this

604
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:29,600
electromagnetic amplification methodology to essentially break the fabric of reality

605
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,840
in a way that uses it as propulsion.

606
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,480
Is that right?

607
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,080
That's 100% correct because once you form this black hole,

608
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,680
I truly believe that every black hole has a white hole.

609
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:47,680
There's a wormhole that truly forms between whatever that locality that you've broken

610
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:54,400
the swing limit and somewhere else that it talks to based on the superpulse, and believe it or not.

611
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,720
Quantum entanglement.

612
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,240
Where does spin kind of, what kind of spin involves here?

613
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,700
Spin.

614
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,560
So in other words, you can accelerate either in spin or accelerate in vibration depending

615
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,280
on which is easier from an engineering point of view.

616
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:19,520
As you well know, when you spin something, even surpassing 10 to the 4 RPM,

617
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,560
it's very hard to do so and keep this thing.

618
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,560
So again, you might choose vibration.

619
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:31,680
I just chose to put in both spin and vibration because the mathematics is highly similar.

620
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,920
From an engineering point of view, you'd want to go with vibration.

621
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,600
When you say spin, do you mean spin like literally spinning a thing?

622
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,560
Not like electrical?

623
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,680
Around its own axis.

624
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,720
And this is interesting, right?

625
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,360
There's a very common through line in a lot of alternate gravity manipulation approaches

626
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,000
relating to either macroscopic spin vis-a-vis something called the Poeum's theory,

627
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,640
Pope Osborne angular momentum synergy theory, something that Richard Eskridge looked into

628
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,000
at Marshall, and then Alzafon's nucleonic spin approaches that he sort of scrubbed with Feynman

629
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,880
back in the 30s.

630
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,080
Very complex stuff.

631
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,280
Yeah, but then you've got Ming-Li's work with the rotating superconductors, the YBCO.

632
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,720
Also, Eugene Puklatnov used rotating superconductors, and I didn't realize this,

633
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:24,240
but Nick Cook, who wrote The Hunt for Zero Point, he went up to Puklatnov and for whatever

634
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,360
reason, Nick Cook had this instinct to ask him about Victor Shalbert.

635
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,200
How we actually think.

636
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,440
Yeah.

637
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,800
And Puklatnov goes, yeah, my father was this Soviet agent at the time.

638
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,160
Or he was a Russian agent.

639
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,800
He was a Soviet?

640
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,280
Soviet.

641
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,760
Soviet, yeah.

642
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,200
He said my father was a Soviet agent, and he was actually counter-intell, and he was

643
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,840
tasked with retrieving a lot of Shalbert's files.

644
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,600
Shalbert was one of the first people to talk about rotating.

645
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,600
I think in his case, he had something called an impeller machine.

646
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
This was pre kind of superconductivity.

647
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,400
Based on implosion rather than, right?

648
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,600
The whole idea of creation, again, a physics based on creation rather than destruction.

649
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,080
Yeah.

650
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,080
Well, and do you think there's a...

651
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,520
Yeah, but there was a connection between Puklatnov and this.

652
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,040
And then Puklatnov said, well, we just needed more higher RPMs.

653
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,240
But again, from an engineering point of view, you know how detrimental that can be.

654
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,120
It's very hard to do.

655
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,240
It's a very exotic environment.

656
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,200
That's why I chose vibration.

657
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,960
What are you going to put in there?

658
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,760
Yeah, sure.

659
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,240
And not just vibration of an electrically charged object, but plasma.

660
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,240
So you think that lineage doesn't make sense from an engineering standpoint.

661
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,320
Actually, vibration makes more sense.

662
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,360
And you know why.

663
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,160
Yeah, yeah.

664
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,400
I mean, because with plasma...

665
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,360
Let's listen to Jack.

666
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,640
By the way, Jack is brilliant.

667
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,600
Like an idiot.

668
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,360
No, no, far from it.

669
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,320
Jesse, please, please, 100%.

670
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,160
That is totally unfair.

671
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,000
Never, never, ever say that.

672
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,520
No, I mean, you guys are more advanced than me.

673
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,960
Well, there's interesting things you can do when you set up standing waves and plasmas.

674
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,760
I mean, you can generate cold plasmas, as he was talking about.

675
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,080
This is something I did in my graduate research back in the day,

676
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,560
with certain frequencies that will pull electrons off of the atoms.

677
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,600
And then you can start doing interesting things with those electrons.

678
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,480
And you can set up double layer plasmas and things like this.

679
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,840
And if you can control where the charge goes...

680
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,240
I mean, this is the problem with a lot of hot fusion experiments,

681
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,320
is that they can't control where the electrons go,

682
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,080
they can't control where the hot ions go.

683
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,920
And so you get all kinds of breaking radiation,

684
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,200
you get Bremsstrahlung,

685
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,920
and you get all kinds of tremendous losses.

686
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,800
And this approach ameliorates that.

687
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,600
So that's why you need cold plasma for the vibration.

688
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,880
It's ideal, yes.

689
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,360
Interesting.

690
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,200
And how do you produce cold plasma?

691
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,040
Not easy, not easy.

692
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,320
That is e cubed.

693
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,840
Okay, got it.

694
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,760
Absolutely, we will not touch on that.

695
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,280
It's in the academic literature, but perhaps we don't verify it.

696
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,240
You're...

697
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,880
Since after all, this is my so-called first in-person interview.

698
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,800
So I shoot out for something to the audience.

699
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:10,480
It involves something that has been given the Nobel Prize in Physics,

700
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,400
I believe it was last year.

701
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,800
Non-local reality, guys?

702
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,800
Lasers.

703
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,840
Lasers.

704
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,400
Interesting.

705
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,120
Leave it there.

706
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,120
So okay, so that's a better approach then.

707
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,680
And then what does this have to do with superconductivity, I guess?

708
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,480
Believe it or not, everything is related at the quantum vacuum level.

709
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,080
So I'll throw something out there.

710
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,480
So in superconducting physics,

711
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,040
so we have this baseline theory called BCS theory.

712
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,880
Bardeen-Coopers.

713
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,920
Bardeen-Coopers, yeah.

714
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,120
So Bardeen, brilliant physicist, two Nobel Prizes,

715
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,520
the transistor and superconductivity.

716
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,800
And so most superconductors, their behavior is characterized by BCS theory.

717
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,120
However, these are typically ultra-low temperature superconductors

718
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,440
and extremely high B-field superconductors.

719
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,720
So these are not terribly useful in industrial commercial application

720
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,280
because the environments you have to put them in are very exotic.

721
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,440
So of course, superconductivity is very useful

722
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,800
because it offers lossless power transmission,

723
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,920
very high electric fields, very high magnetic fields.

724
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,720
I've often said that the development and discovery

725
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,800
of a room temperature superconductor would be

726
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,600
as transformative to commerce and industry as antigravity.

727
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,400
Very disruptive.

728
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,040
100%.

729
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,400
Very disruptive.

730
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,840
Now, so there's been a lot of research last 30 or 40 years

731
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,360
into topological materials, topological insulators,

732
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,520
and then something called topological superconductors.

733
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,400
And the nature of a topological material is,

734
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,200
so typically you have crystal lattice materials.

735
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,840
So metals are crystals, insulators are crystals,

736
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,680
semiconductors are crystals.

737
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,400
Ordinarily, those crystals have the same properties

738
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,920
throughout the bulk of the matrix.

739
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,040
Like no matter which way, frequently they're isotropic,

740
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,600
meaning this way or that way, or they're anisotropic,

741
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,680
meaning it's different this way versus that way.

742
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,640
When you make semiconductor crystals, you get polycrystalline.

743
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,000
So you get grain boundaries and features stop

744
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,960
at these grain boundaries.

745
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
And so you start to get anisotropies.

746
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,680
That's significant to manufacturing semiconductor materials

747
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,960
where we're doping these layers with different atoms.

748
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,360
And we've been doping since the 1950s.

749
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,960
This has been around some time.

750
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,840
But the level of precision in semiconductor doping

751
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,960
is three or four orders of magnitude lower

752
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,160
than what we're talking about

753
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,800
with these quantum heterostructure lattices,

754
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,880
where you really need these big chromium and vanadium atoms

755
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,040
that install their ferromagnetic ordering across the lattice.

756
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
You need them in very specific lattice locations.

757
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,560
Jack, you're absolutely brilliant and right on.

758
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,080
But let's bring it to a very simplest, again,

759
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,400
Occam's razor, simplicity and minimalism.

760
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,200
One does superconductivity truly represent

761
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,480
a macroscopic quantum phenomenon.

762
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,980
Yes.

763
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,120
And it speaks directly to macroscopic quantum coherence.

764
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,920
Look very carefully at slides four to nine

765
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,880
in the 2019 AIAA SciTech.

766
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,600
A lot of people have gone over those slides as if

767
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,680
there's nothing there.

768
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,560
There's something of incredibly important

769
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,280
How do you maintain coherence at macroscopic scales?

770
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,840
Not easy at all.

771
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,800
Condensates.

772
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,960
Because everything wants to decohere.

773
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,240
Everything wants extremely cold temperatures.

774
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,880
Again, the atoms being in this nice dance.

775
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,200
Because again, because of electron full-arm repulsion,

776
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,640
these things don't want to pair up.

777
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,040
And yet BCS theory says that they should.

778
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,120
And Dr. Victor Lacnoe believes it's not the electrons,

779
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,400
but bipolarons.

780
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,040
The whole idea of a bipolaron mechanism

781
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
that occurs at these higher temperatures.

782
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,480
Which is a quasi-particle.

783
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,960
It's a composite quasi-particle of two polarons.

784
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,200
A polaron is itself a quasi-particle.

785
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,840
And the Pais effect speaks directly to what?

786
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,960
To this mechanism of room temperature superconductivity.

787
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,460
How?

788
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:04,740
It basically says once you form an alternating magnetic field,

789
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,660
once you form this Bose-Eythron condensate

790
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,340
that Victor Lacnoe speaks to,

791
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,700
you can use a pulse current, again,

792
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,940
an alternate current, to move it.

793
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,580
To move it.

794
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,460
To manipulate it.

795
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:24,260
And yet no one has touched either the Victor Lacnoe paper

796
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,700
or my patent.

797
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,340
Thinking again, it's pseudo-science.

798
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,140
How would you do this?

799
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,380
So the reason, generally, you can't get superconductivity

800
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,940
at high temperatures is because the atoms in the material

801
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,140
have all this thermal motion.

802
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,660
They have all this thermal energy.

803
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,980
And so the nature of superconductivity

804
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,420
is that this thing called a phonon,

805
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,140
which is a vibratory mode of an atom inside of a lattice,

806
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,620
phonons facilitate the transfer of electrons

807
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,380
through the lattice as cooper pairs.

808
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,300
So the Pauli exclusion principle only applies

809
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,660
to spin one half bosons.

810
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,940
I know this is really deep.

811
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,660
But what happens is when you force electrons close together,

812
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,140
they behave as though they're a spin one particle,

813
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,740
meaning Pauli no longer applies.

814
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,460
And so they can both occupy the minimum ground state

815
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,820
so they can move together.

816
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,260
So there's no degeneracy.

817
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,700
There's no energy splitting.

818
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,700
And so they move very efficiently through the lattice.

819
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,820
Problem is, if this lattice is warm

820
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,060
and all these atoms are vibrating randomly,

821
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,260
you can't get this coherent phonon behavior.

822
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,900
In extremely novelty-comprised lattices,

823
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,620
you put atoms in just the right place

824
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,780
such that these internal magnetic fields

825
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,460
set up these roadways, stop signs, highways

826
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,980
for current to flow.

827
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,660
And you can get this behavior.

828
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,020
So it involved you would need to fabricate materials

829
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,380
on an atomic level.

830
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,140
You need to get sub-banks.

831
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,500
But not the Pais effect.

832
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,660
The Pais effect does not speak to anything

833
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,140
depending on chemical composition.

834
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,020
That's why Dr. Victor Lagno, he picked it up

835
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,020
because he realized this is the solution

836
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,540
to an active superconductor, one that's not passive,

837
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,340
one that is not based on chemical composition,

838
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:08,180
like the type Ia or the type II superconductors.

839
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,540
This is basically, it can be done as long as this thing

840
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,180
at any point in its structure has been superconducting.

841
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:22,420
For example, that's why I chose lead, zirconate, titanate.

842
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,460
All three components at very low temperatures

843
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,660
are superconducting.

844
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,140
Sure.

845
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,100
And yet, because of the bipolar mechanism

846
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,820
that Dr. Lagno, I believe in his paper,

847
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,660
it's just a three-page paper.

848
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,300
But on the third page, he gives the mechanism

849
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,580
and he speaks to the Pais effect room temperatures

850
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,620
for conduction.

851
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,740
You believe it'll work.

852
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,900
So these materials are superconducting

853
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,220
in their natural state, even at room temperature?

854
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,260
Not at room temperature.

855
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,940
At very low temperature.

856
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,020
He's describing conventional superconductors

857
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,540
like YBCO and from...

858
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:00,820
Lead, zirconate, titanate, BB, ZR, Ti.

859
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,700
These are the components

860
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,020
of what they call piezoelectric material.

861
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,220
You know, Townsend Brown spent the latter half of his career

862
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,380
looking at these electric material.

863
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,580
They're very important because one talks to, again,

864
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,300
the whole idea that pressure induced what?

865
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:24,740
The electric field can also induce pressure changes.

866
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,500
In the vacuum.

867
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,820
Well, I discovered something very interesting.

868
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,300
The Townsend Brown ceramic insulator of choice

869
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,980
was very enlightening.

870
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,780
It's on the chalkboard in videos of him

871
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,380
at Acufonsi's class.

872
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,100
This is what changed my mind about Townsend Brown.

873
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,700
They had dismissed his work.

874
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,380
And they have dismissed his work.

875
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,500
And he says, by the way, at the beginning of Townsend Brown's

876
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,260
what they're giving proposal, he says,

877
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,380
Oliver Heavyside had a very adequate theory of gravity

878
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,580
back in the 1890s.

879
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,740
So we would be right to listen to him.

880
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,460
So, you know, that was his opinion as well.

881
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,780
I'm convinced that some well-meaning physicists

882
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,100
just didn't see the application

883
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,740
to exotic condensed matter physics at the time.

884
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,660
You know, because I think these are subtle effects

885
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:11,380
for which the coupling is small in natural materials.

886
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,100
And, you know, as we started to manufacture semiconductors,

887
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,140
this was the world's first metamaterial in the broad sense.

888
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,620
It's not an optical metamaterial in the strict sense.

889
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:24,260
But you start to set up these solid state environments

890
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,180
that have fundamentally different environments.

891
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,540
And we're just now getting to the point

892
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,260
where we have the SEM tools to interrogate these things.

893
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,940
And we have the chemical vapor deposition

894
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,300
and the atomic vapor deposition to actually make them.

895
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,300
And then we have the interrogation tools

896
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,060
to know for sure what we really made.

897
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,460
I mean, these experiments take years to set up and execute.

898
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:41,940
That's why it's...

899
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,860
They're not easy. They're not easy.

900
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,140
What would be the next step for...

901
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,460
I mean, because let's build a UFO.

902
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,180
I mean, if there was ever a time where we were, you know,

903
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,060
geopolitically unstable on a macro level

904
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,940
and need to throw a Hail Mary, it would be right now.

905
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,700
And I don't know what we have built.

906
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,260
You know, maybe we're way more advanced than...

907
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:00,980
I mean, what do you think?

908
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,220
Do you think we're way more advanced than meets the ERI?

909
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,420
I truly believe we must be.

910
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,700
This democracy must win.

911
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,580
This republic must stand.

912
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,740
We must survive.

913
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,780
So yes, I believe we shall.

914
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,980
Do you think that what you're looking into

915
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,860
has already been discovered and then some

916
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,540
in kind of private quarters?

917
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,660
Or do you think that you're deriving something fund battling?

918
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,860
Absolutely not.

919
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:37,380
I do not think I'm an original in this at all.

920
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,620
As a matter of fact, the physics that I speak to

921
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,100
was available in the 1890s

922
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,180
and there were great physicists at the time, great brains.

923
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:50,260
I'm 100% sure that I'm not an original in this.

924
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:50,900
Not at all.

925
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:51,540
Many interesting things.

926
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,860
It's just the way that I address the Pais effect,

927
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,260
especially from the room temperature superconductor.

928
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,540
Now, the Pais effect driven room temperature superconductor,

929
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,300
I do believe I'm an original in.

930
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,020
I would believe that.

931
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,180
And Victor Locno attests to that.

932
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,540
He says it could work.

933
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,020
Now, for a man of his capacity,

934
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,540
of his capability, of his mathematical prowess,

935
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:15,460
and not just mathematical physics or physical mathematics

936
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,500
where the physics drives the mathematics, not vice versa,

937
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,420
this man thinks that this could work.

938
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,700
I believe it should be looked at.

939
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,980
Well, there are these claimed replications

940
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,180
of room temperature.

941
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,140
Okay, 99?

942
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,700
A couple of years ago.

943
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,420
They refer it.

944
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,340
Pretty, yeah, you're the only English-speaking patent

945
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,780
that's in the citations.

946
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,140
The rest are Korean and Chinese.

947
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,220
But everybody thinks this is pseudoscience.

948
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:39,720
How come?

949
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,500
Well, yeah, so do you think that this has already been done?

950
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,540
You think it's been discovered?

951
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,300
Do you know that that team was so sure of their results

952
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,220
that they published one paper with six authors

953
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,140
and then they published another paper with three authors

954
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,460
because only three people can share a Nobel Prize?

955
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,580
They were that confident.

956
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,080
Whoa.

957
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,540
Then what happened upon the era?

958
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,700
There were people that replicated it.

959
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,380
Reproduction issues, yeah.

960
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,500
There were Chinese teams that replicated the experiment.

961
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,860
It went into the void as if...

962
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,860
So you guys seem to lend a little more credence

963
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,820
than meets the eye to LKNL now?

964
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,460
Maybe, yeah.

965
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,940
I think I had heard there were reproduction issues,

966
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,060
other labs tried to make it,

967
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,700
and I find it hard to believe other labs would cover it up

968
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,980
because, again, it's grants galore waiting to happen.

969
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,140
You have, you know, I've talked to a leader who always

970
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,420
I love, I think he's an American here, a great guy.

971
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:36,580
When I speak to him, he really has to speak super cryptically

972
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,700
about like, you know, some very destructive...

973
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,380
Save the world, but also destroy the world.

974
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,740
We all have to play nicely together,

975
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,260
like the toy or whatever is this,

976
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,900
or is he talking about room temperature superconductivity?

977
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:50,980
Who knows?

978
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,480
Aslo.

979
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:51,980
Aslo.

980
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,080
The man doesn't drink, I believe,

981
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,360
so you might not be able to get any information out of him.

982
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,360
He's also a very...

983
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,720
You can tell the man has seen a lot.

984
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,680
So on that note, you know, on the subject of proliferation,

985
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,120
I find it very fascinating to think about the fact

986
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,720
that Manhattan, we got a little lucky

987
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,200
and that nuclear weapons turn out to be very difficult to make.

988
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,200
And so proliferation was slow.

989
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,960
In terms of the weaponization of UAP physics,

990
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,080
and we've of course mentioned

991
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,240
there could be multiple branches and different tech trees.

992
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,720
Do you have a sense that this technology

993
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,440
will be difficult to replicate, difficult to manufacture?

994
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:32,840
No.

995
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,120
Or very easy?

996
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:34,680
No.

997
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,080
However, there's a paper out there,

998
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,840
Plasma Compression Fusion Device.

999
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,600
You and I were talking right before.

1000
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,100
Yeah.

1001
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:48,440
It's being cited by some very important research teams in China.

1002
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:53,160
And the latest that's being cited is of this year,

1003
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,960
IEEE Journal of Cybernetics.

1004
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,160
Can you imagine making a Plasma Compression Fusion Device

1005
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,760
something compact?

1006
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:08,040
Now, in what artificial intelligence domain

1007
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,400
would cybernetics couple with if you were to use such a device?

1008
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,200
Say such a device was operational.

1009
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,720
It could be made operational.

1010
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,960
In a small footprint, a power source,

1011
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,320
something like Iron Man's reactor.

1012
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,080
Could you imagine what you would use that in?

1013
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,400
Why would the IEEE Journal of Cybernetics be interested

1014
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,720
in that particular work?

1015
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,600
Think what that would mean.

1016
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:37,720
Terrifying.

1017
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,440
I mean, you...

1018
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,080
Terrifying.

1019
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,440
Terrifying with so many ways.

1020
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,520
Enormous energy densities are terrifying in every way.

1021
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,160
Every...

1022
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,720
But imagine an army of those.

1023
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,280
What they could mean.

1024
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,200
Leave it there, Jesse.

1025
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,080
Trust me on that.

1026
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:53,960
Leave it there.

1027
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,680
It's freaky.

1028
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,960
Yeah, it's very freaky.

1029
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,720
Again, the fusion of ideas, cross-domain,

1030
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,800
the ability of using information from different disciplines.

1031
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,760
That's in the open literature.

1032
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,760
That's why OSINT can be so incredibly important

1033
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,600
in the right hands in cross-domain technology,

1034
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,000
interdisciplinary, across those OSINT controls,

1035
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,200
extremely dangerous.

1036
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,040
It already has.

1037
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:22,920
And it already is.

1038
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,840
The use of AI tools in reverse engineering,

1039
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,120
all of these ideas right out of the ether,

1040
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,160
right off the internet is very powerful already.

1041
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,680
It's helped a lot of us in the disclosure effort

1042
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,800
find things that are out there in the public domain

1043
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,320
that just maybe we didn't realize

1044
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,600
they were already in the public domain.

1045
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,760
However, it's also a cubed.

1046
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,680
Not a good idea.

1047
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,640
Well, okay, so you also have written a lot

1048
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,880
about high-frequency gravitational waves.

1049
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,600
Yes, sir.

1050
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,000
And so how does that play into all of this?

1051
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,840
And why don't we actually zoom out real quick

1052
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,600
and just explain how, okay,

1053
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,600
if you've had a room temperature superconductor

1054
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,960
and then you had the Pais effect,

1055
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,800
how would this allow you to possibly build a UFO?

1056
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,960
Like, how does that play into, you know...

1057
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,640
I cannot speak to that.

1058
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,760
I cannot speak to that.

1059
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,240
Okay.

1060
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,760
But again, please,

1061
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,720
there is no such thing as faster-than-light travel.

1062
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,200
Einsteinian physics is never broken.

1063
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,520
Einstein was 100%.

1064
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:25,400
Everything Einstein has come up with is 100% real.

1065
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,520
And I truly believe that, for example,

1066
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,960
even quantum entanglement,

1067
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,000
we're not talking about instantaneous communication here.

1068
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,600
So you don't believe that, like,

1069
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,240
a lot of people in national security disclosure world

1070
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,880
talk about alcooliary warp drives,

1071
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,880
you know, involving negative mass or negative energy

1072
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,800
to allow for faster-than-light travel.

1073
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,640
You don't think that's possible.

1074
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,160
I do not believe that.

1075
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,560
Again, once you break,

1076
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,400
once you create this black hole,

1077
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,120
Einsteinian physics no longer truly applies.

1078
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,120
Think of the paradigm.

1079
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:02,520
It's as if you have broken known physics to begin with.

1080
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,480
A whole, again, I choose not to call it new physics,

1081
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,480
but truly, that's what it truly is.

1082
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,120
Let's get a little,

1083
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,520
so as you hit the swinging limit,

1084
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,480
break spacetime,

1085
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,840
what happens vis-a-vis this fifth dimension?

1086
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,720
We'll not.

1087
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,360
Okay.

1088
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,480
We'll not touch on that.

1089
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:19,980
Okay.

1090
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,680
What's interesting about alcooliary drive, I think,

1091
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,600
is this notion of negative energy.

1092
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,120
And there have been people who have associated

1093
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,440
negative energy with quantum vacuum energy.

1094
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,160
That's right.

1095
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,720
What's interesting is it could be the case

1096
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,800
that the alcoubier approach

1097
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,200
and the quantum vacuum approach

1098
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,520
in fact arrive at the same result.

1099
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,120
They're just different paradigms

1100
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,640
for looking at the same thing.

1101
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,020
Yeah.

1102
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,720
But what's interestingly different is

1103
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,840
alcoubier is a strictly Einsteinian notion

1104
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,720
in a manner of speaking.

1105
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,200
It operates entirely within general relativity.

1106
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,640
It doesn't require a TOE.

1107
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,920
It doesn't require new physics,

1108
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,200
which also is somewhat unhelpful

1109
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,760
because it doesn't give us guideposts to new physics.

1110
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,600
It's not really informative in any way.

1111
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,120
Whereas these kinds of approaches

1112
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,240
do require those things.

1113
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,120
Absolutely.

1114
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,240
Huge news, everyone.

1115
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,440
We've been sitting on a ton of unreleased footage

1116
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,880
that we will now be releasing weekly in our new WAP.

1117
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,360
Our first episode is a completely uncut,

1118
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,360
heated discussion between Hal Puthoff

1119
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,520
and Eric Weinstein on remote viewing.

1120
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,040
Yeah, you heard that right.

1121
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,760
I still can't believe I experienced that firsthand

1122
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,520
and now I'm happy to share it with you all

1123
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,320

Thank you so much and enjoy the rest of today's episode.

1147
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,120
Can you talk about how high frequency gravity waves

1148
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,440
might allow for UFO-like activity, or?

1149
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,400
I would rather not.

1150
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:29,880
Okay.

1151
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,720
I would rather not, not go there.

1152
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,240
I found it interesting that...

1153
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:33,720
It could all...

1154
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,240
And that's just because it can be weaponized, so...

1155
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,800
No, no, let's not go there.

1156
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,320
Well, I did find it interesting, just high level, that...

1157
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:47,720
I believe Evgeny Potklednov has hit on something already.

1158
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,040
And if it's true that he has made this

1159
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,960
impulse gravitational generator...

1160
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,280
Wow.

1161
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:58,440
Scary.

1162
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,880
Because he's funded by the Russians.

1163
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,200
So why do they...

1164
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,600
Once upon a time, I was told he was working

1165
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,120
for an American contractor.

1166
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:08,840
Is he?

1167
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,960
I thought he might be.

1168
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,440
Because I...

1169
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,840
The latest rumors is that...

1170
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,640
I had heard going.

1171
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,200
Oh, phantomorph.

1172
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:16,600
Yeah.

1173
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:16,840
Yeah.

1174
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,200
I hope...

1175
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,160
Yeah, he's a phantomorph.

1176
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,240
I'm pretty sure he's repatriated.

1177
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,800
Okay, so this is really a very scary setup,

1178
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,320
because basically, it's funny, because after this conversation,

1179
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,320
I'm neurotic about this conversation,

1180
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,360
but I'm so much less neurotic about outing towns in Brown,

1181
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,200
who I'm sure is right,

1182
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,560
because that is so far down the chain of like...

1183
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,920
It's like so not dangerous.

1184
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,200
To me, it's absurd from an American national security standpoint

1185
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,760
that it would all be controversial to destigmatize him.

1186
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,280
He's this side.

1187
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,720
He's also a Navy scientist.

1188
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,760
He was a great man.

1189
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,160
Great man.

1190
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:55,560
He is a great man.

1191
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,960
He destigmatized his own work, probably for good reason,

1192
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,280
because at the time, I think it was the tip of the sphere.

1193
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,720
And it was this Cold War secrecy era.

1194
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,000
But just based on this conversation,

1195
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
it sounds like all nations are pretty far advanced

1196
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,680
as far as these heterodox frameworks.

1197
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,160
And if you're the US, you need to be getting

1198
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,200
as many young people aware of these things

1199
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,320
as soon as humanly possible, at least from a high level.

1200
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:19,640
Yeah.

1201
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,320
Otherwise, where the hell is the talent going to come from?

1202
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:21,560
Yeah.

1203
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:22,920
Seriously.

1204
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,160
Yeah.

1205
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,840
And Weinstein has spoken on this, too.

1206
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,360
And I think there's missing names.

1207
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,080
What's going on?

1208
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,520
Who's actually working on it?

1209
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,480
Right.

1210
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:31,880
Totally.

1211
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,240
Or even just like, what are the proper frameworks?

1212
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,960
It's like, finally, it seems like string theory is capitulating

1213
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,400
after getting bashed over the head for the last 10 years by polemicists.

1214
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:46,360
They've seemed like not a super self-aware crowd.

1215
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,040
Up until maybe the last couple of years,

1216
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,320
they're all saying Leonard Susskind just won on theories of everything.

1217
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:51,800
Mm-hmm.

1218
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,240
Kurt Jemmell, a great interviewer.

1219
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,080
I think we've kind of...

1220
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,360
With the cap on straight forward.

1221
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:58,860
Yeah.

1222
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:04,280
But you would expect some sort of coordinated effort on high

1223
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,160
when it comes to the American national security state,

1224
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,320
when it comes to letting this stuff out.

1225
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,680
And I always feel like I'm sort of in an awkward position with it.

1226
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,440
For example, with the Townsend Brown stuff,

1227
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,400
where clearly that was the right thing to do,

1228
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,680
but it's in retrospect every time this sort of conversation.

1229
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,680
It's like you never know what the right thing is.

1230
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,480
I suspect some of this has to do with the fact

1231
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,600
the majority of the program was executed during the Cold War.

1232
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,600
And I think perhaps at one time,

1233
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,120
we were quite certain that we were the only ones with anything.

1234
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,960
And we thought worst case scenario,

1235
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,440
we put a big footprint on this.

1236
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:46,280
And just like Manhattan, the adversary infiltrates the program

1237
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,040
and steals what we've gotten.

1238
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,720
And all of a sudden, there's this proliferation

1239
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,720
of next generation weapons of mass destruction,

1240
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,400
as I spoke to Dave Grush about.

1241
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,280
And maybe they thought for the longest time,

1242
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,040
max priority is bury it.

1243
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,640
Keep it totally, totally silent.

1244
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,080
No one knows it exists.

1245
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,600
Distance second priority.

1246
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,720
Glean as many technical insights from it as you can every once in a while.

1247
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,120
And unfortunately, somehow, eventually, they did get it

1248
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,640
either through their own crash retrievals

1249
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,200
or infiltrating our program, whatever it might be.

1250
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,320
And now there is a race and we are not in first.

1251
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:18,760
That's wild.

1252
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,520
What do you think it is at first?

1253
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,840
If I had to guess between Russia and China, I'd say China.

1254
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,680
They're not distracted with a regional war.

1255
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,160
They have a significant amount of resources to put towards it.

1256
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,760
They've repatriated a lot of their alumni from this country.

1257
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,120
Every year, China graduates more STEM professionals

1258
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,960
than exist in the entire United States.

1259
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,680
They're brilliant.

1260
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,880
How many times they've won the Math Olympiads?

1261
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,000
Do you think that's simple?

1262
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,500
Sure.

1263
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,560
And do you think it's probably, you know,

1264
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,400
it's like the three-body problem or whatever.

1265
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:53,160
The PRC, if they want you to work on some highly class-wide stuff,

1266
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,680
they just knock on your door.

1267
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,400
And here it's just as complicated and bureaucratic.

1268
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,560
You know, you have all these corporate thief domes

1269
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,280
with local incentives taking shots at one another.

1270
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,520
I truly think that one day we must unite the factions

1271
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,080
because I think one day we shall have...

1272
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:09,560
One day?

1273
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,280
You need now.

1274
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:10,840
What do you mean?

1275
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:15,880
Listen, as soon as possible because I think we have an external enemy.

1276
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,880
And by external enemy, I mean...

1277
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,760
Very external.

1278
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,200
Very external.

1279
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:20,920
What are you talking about?

1280
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,440
NHI?

1281
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,480
NHI.

1282
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,560
So did the doomer take?

1283
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,320
So yeah, what evidence do we have?

1284
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,640
Because, you know, when you speak to Lou Elizondo,

1285
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,400
you have sort of this like idea that something is imminent.

1286
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,080
It could be possibly hostile contact.

1287
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,080
Maybe they're prepping the battle space.

1288
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,760
I tend to think at least historically looking back.

1289
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,640
Think of the earth.

1290
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:42,940
Okay.

1291
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:51,960
People have warred for less than the place of extreme natural resources.

1292
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,240
We are a very yummy apple.

1293
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:55,740
Very.

1294
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,280
Yeah, but do you have any everybody's eye?

1295
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:58,600
Sure.

1296
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:06,120
But it's like you have thousands of years of history where we haven't had contact.

1297
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,240
Or maybe if we have had contact, at least it's ephemeral enough

1298
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,400
where our modern historical perspective,

1299
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,640
I believe we've had contact with thousands of years.

1300
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,760
But in this weakly entangled ephemeral way,

1301
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,600
in a way that if you were to talk to a conventional historian,

1302
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,640
they would not say that...

1303
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,160
They'd say we're alone.

1304
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,160
We're at the top of the consciousness food chain.

1305
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,640
So do you guys have any information that I dealt

1306
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:32,360
when it comes to something coming down the pike as far as hostile content?

1307
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,480
Well, there are people who feel strongly that there have been reset events,

1308
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,320
human history reset events.

1309
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,360
For instance, 70,000 years ago, we know genomically there was a bottleneck.

1310
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:46,520
There was a human bottleneck event where something like 7,500 members of the population

1311
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:49,000
are our descendants or our ancestors.

1312
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,320
And I don't know what to think of that.

1313
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,720
I mean, I don't really necessarily see the purpose,

1314
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,240
but you do have to speculate.

1315
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,360
There's so many degrees of freedom associated with what are their motives?

1316
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,280
Are they resource-constructed in some way?

1317
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,520
What continues to be interesting in 50,000 years?

1318
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,160
Isn't it fairly well-documented that that was Luis and Walter Alvarez,

1319
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,600
Luis Walter Alvarez, the father who was in the Manhattan Project.

1320
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,960
They had this theory that an asteroid hit the earth,

1321
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,880
wiped out the dinosaurs around that period,

1322
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,040
and then you get this Cambrian explosion of new life.

1323
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,480
So that doesn't feel like non-human intelligence to me.

1324
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,440
No, no.

1325
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,280
I don't mean extinction level event resets.

1326
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,680
I mean, more recent than that, like in human history.

1327
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:33,720
For instance, the Toba event and the Randall Carlson stuff

1328
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,280
and the Graham Hancock stuff, the reset 12,000 years ago.

1329
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,640
You know what I'm talking about?

1330
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,920
But that might have just been a common airburst from the tour.

1331
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,560
Absolutely.

1332
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,840
Oh, yeah, I fully agree.

1333
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,520
So it's not the middle.

1334
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,480
OK, but then again, you need more evidence.

1335
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,080
If you're going to say that non-human contact that's hostile is coming down the pike.

1336
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,920
Well, there's a book out there.

1337
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,800
OK, what's the book?

1338
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,840
Charles Ford, Book of the Dam.

1339
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,840
It starts with very interesting words.

1340
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,840
I believe we are property.

1341
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,400
Read that book.

1342
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,440
It's very interesting.

1343
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,480
It's for your audience.

1344
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,440
Let them look into this little breadcrumbs.

1345
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:15,240
We're property.

1346
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,800
So we're already colonized.

1347
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,040
What are we?

1348
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,880
Again, the whole idea of are we a civilization with amnesia?

1349
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,160
As a certain gentleman?

1350
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,560
Well, we Graham Hancock.

1351
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,440
Graham Hancock, sure.

1352
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:36,680
Well, we definitely seem to follow this like local incentive, scarcity, gamified thing

1353
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,040
that doesn't seem like it's in the best interest of our race

1354
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,520
ascending into anything more real.

1355
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:47,000
And that's the thing that attracts me to the whole UFO phenomenon for all its

1356
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,160
weird cast of characters and Hall of Mirrors vibes.

1357
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:57,560
It feels like a somewhat transcendent topic where maybe we can descend out of...

1358
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:05,000
I think we will soon, soon enough anyway, face a tremendous threat from without.

1359
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,080
I believe, as the great Ronald Reagan once said,

1360
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:15,880
if we do not come together as a unified Earth, we will not withstand what's coming.

1361
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,080
Do you think it's already...

1362
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:23,320
You have these rumors of the gray aliens collecting biological samples.

1363
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,360
I do not know.

1364
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,040
I truly do not know.

1365
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,880
Why does it happen in contact?

1366
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,320
Because that's a crazy, that's a really big assertion.

1367
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,040
Do you ascribe to the battlefield preparation hypothesis

1368
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,360
that the vehicles acting aggressively with fighter planes,

1369
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:42,840
that the vehicles overflying the test fields and shutting missiles off?

1370
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,880
Of course the testing.

1371
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,840
Do you think so?

1372
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:49,240
And that's why we should be very careful on putting all our money into

1373
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:56,680
reverse engineered craft because they already have their own technologies.

1374
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,680
They know how to defeat their own thing.

1375
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,680
What if there's good factions and bad factions?

1376
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,200
Like when I speak to Robert Hastings, I'm praying for that

1377
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,000
because otherwise we do not have a chance in hell.

1378
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Well, a lot of the nuclear stuff is like shutting down silos.

1379
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,320
And then a lot of the messaging that people get seems to be like

1380
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,040
you're going to destroy yourselves in some sort of nuclear holocaust

1381
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,000
and you need to come together now and focus more on the environment

1382
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,280
and that sort of thing.

1383
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,800
It's a green PC type things.

1384
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,400
I'm not saying that's not some tricksterism.

1385
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,480
It's hard to say.

1386
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,280
We need to maintain that.

1387
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,400
If there are multiple...

1388
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,360
Yes, I completely agree.

1389
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,880
If there are multiple actors in the space,

1390
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,440
it's incredibly hard to attribute what to what.

1391
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:39,720
Yeah.

1392
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:43,800
How does your work, Sal, connect with the great output off?

1393
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,400
I read a lot of his papers and he is great indeed.

1394
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,760
Don't forget, I believe this man,

1395
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:56,360
if he was not connected with things that are taken as non-scientific

1396
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:00,440
and then pseudoscience like remote viewing would have deserved,

1397
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,160
is deserving of a Nobel Prize, truly.

1398
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:10,680
Especially the physical review paper on gravity and that's pure brilliance.

1399
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,960
What does he say about gravity?

1400
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:17,960
When he describes gravity as an emergent property of the underlying space-time foam

1401
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:21,640
and it's put off like seminal work of space-time.

1402
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,200
So if you can electrically polarize the vacuum,

1403
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,120
then you can manipulate gravity like you can manipulate variables in Maxwell's equation.

1404
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,680
Yeah, and he's the first to talk about that.

1405
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:35,160
It's funny, he was touching on it in my interview with him and Eric Weinstein

1406
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:41,080
and we didn't quite get into the mechanism because this idea, I think...

1407
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,920
Eric couldn't believe that he worked on remote viewing.

1408
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:52,280
I could tell that, again, for Harvard-trained mathematician,

1409
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:58,200
the idea of even remote viewing being possible with such an abnormality.

1410
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,560
What do you think of remote viewing?

1411
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,440
I think remote action is possible.

1412
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,480
So that's even farther than remote viewing.

1413
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,600
Can you imagine stopping at hard just by thinking about it?

1414
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,040
Say from Qatar.

1415
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:10,920
That's scary.

1416
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,120
That's some scary shit.

1417
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:19,960
Anyway, who needs the CIA's hard stopping gun when you can do it with a saw?

1418
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:26,760
There are rumors about the fact that there was other teams of remote viewers being trained by

1419
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,440
Pat Price and Joe McGonigal other than...

1420
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,320
Yeah, there are rumors that are still going on.

1421
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:38,840
I mean, if you read Skimarkers at the Pentagon, it was definitely still going on in the context

1422
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:43,720
of OSAP, but I don't think it ended in 1995.

1423
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:48,040
I mean, you have Joseph McGonigal won the Legion of Merit for over 200 times,

1424
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:52,760
which he helped to relax intelligence, hostage cases, drawing up nuclear sites,

1425
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,480
that sort of thing.

1426
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,240
You don't just end a program like that.

1427
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,720
Yeah, it just wouldn't make sense.

1428
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,880
I also think we're emerging.

1429
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:05,240
We're figuring out more and more possible physical models of consciousness

1430
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,760
that might explain remote viewing.

1431
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,280
So if the brain is a hybrid quantum classical system,

1432
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:15,480
which Penrose would be one model, and I don't know if microtubules are the right thing,

1433
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,400
but they can maintain coherence up until the single point.

1434
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,840
They grab it and run it or whatever.

1435
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,640
That's important.

1436
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,960
If that's the case, then in quantum systems, you have temporal non-motality,

1437
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:29,240
and you can reverse cubic positions in quantum computations.

1438
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,880
Then if you get into a working quantum computer,

1439
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,840
maybe you can send information on the application like back in time.

1440
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,920
Many people building quantum computers say that.

1441
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,560
If your brain is a hybrid quantum classical computer,

1442
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,480
maybe you are accessing shards of information from the future,

1443
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,240
especially if you're given confirmatory feedback.

1444
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,880
How does the brain prevent decoherence?

1445
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,320
That's the question I should ask.

1446
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:57,160
Probably through non-abelian statistics, just like the Bayes effect.

1447
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,120
That must be some meditation technique or something.

1448
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,080
No, I'm sorry.

1449
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,640
Non-abelian statistics, it's like Fermi-Durac statistics.

1450
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:10,280
That's a type of particle statistic model that emerges from standard model physics.

1451
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,200
I know from a mathematical perspective,

1452
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:15,960
but a dog isn't doing vector calculus when he's catching a frisbee.

1453
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:21,720
What protocol should we do to maintain coherence?

1454
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:22,520
Great question.

1455
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,560
Sal, what do you think?

1456
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,360
Great question.

1457
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,240
What do we do?

1458
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:25,960
Great question.

1459
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,000
How do we get to the fifth event?

1460
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,280
How do we hit the Schwinger limit?

1461
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:30,920
Be cute.

1462
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,120
For example, in these UAP phenomena,

1463
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:41,000
they speak of mind-matter connection.

1464
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,720
But there must be a transfer.

1465
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,960
There must be an intermittent medium.

1466
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,560
What is that intermittent medium?

1467
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,840
It has occurred to me that these...

1468
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,720
The vacuum itself.

1469
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,320
Oh, yeah.

1470
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,440
What else can be there?

1471
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,840
The medium for which...

1472
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,880
How does light transfer?

1473
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,560
To photons.

1474
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,960
But you're saying where's the medium?

1475
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,120
Because every other wave has to move through a medium.

1476
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:09,560
A medium.

1477
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,060
The ether?

1478
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,560
I don't know.

1479
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:12,040
Something.

1480
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,160
A quantum vacuum.

1481
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,040
A quantum vacuum.

1482
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,640
Is it at the superforce level?

1483
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,480
Is that at the Planck scale?

1484
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,960
The superforce, we're talking about 10 to the 44 Newton.

1485
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,960
It has to be in a bit of a dimensional state.

1486
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,240
It would have to be...

1487
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,320
Which Ken Shoulders talks about,

1488
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,520
the dimensional space for exotic vacuum objects.

1489
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:30,840
Yeah.

1490
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,200
I suppose it doesn't have to be.

1491
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,600
It's not necessarily required

1492
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,520
that we have higher dimensional spaces.

1493
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,200
I mean, there could always...

1494
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,240
So Kaluza-Klein compactified sub-dimensions.

1495
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,200
It has problems,

1496
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,240
but the general notion of higher dimension...

1497
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,840
It solves some problems.

1498
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,360
It explains the hierarchy problem.

1499
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,000
It explains the gravitational weakness problem.

1500
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,560
Why is gravity 31 orders of magnitude weaker

1501
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:54,920
than the strong nuclear force or something?

1502
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,480
Remember what Kaluza thinks of electrical charges.

1503
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:00,840
What motion in the fifth dimension?

1504
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:02,600
Really?

1505
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,640
How interesting.

1506
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,360
Fascinating.

1507
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,120
It was interesting.

1508
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:06,760
Fascinating.

1509
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,360
I was reading Frontiers of Propulsion Science by Aaron Davis.

1510
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,480
Great book, by the way.

1511
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,960
Eric W. Davis, no matter what he says on my physics,

1512
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,160
the man must be congratulated for that book.

1513
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,840
Just for that book alone.

1514
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:21,560
I brought my copy.

1515
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,520
Him and Mark Millis are amazing,

1516
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,160
but you can tell that the real forte

1517
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,400
behind the physics is Dr. Davis.

1518
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,120
Well, he says...

1519
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,080
My hat off to him.

1520
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,280
He says something around the Leibniz-Brown effect,

1521
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,440
which he believes in the Holst & Neve.

1522
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,000
If you take the face value,

1523
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,440
that's just a coronal wind or ionic wind,

1524
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,200
and it's not actually a tie

1525
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,800
between electromagnetic and gravity.

1526
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,080
But I think at one point he says

1527
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:49,560
you would need a fifth dimensional space

1528
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,320
to connect EM and gravity

1529
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,080
if this weren't actually work.

1530
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,560
Exactly.

1531
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,680
Very interesting.

1532
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,880
I think fundamental...

1533
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,800
Oh, Dr. Davis is very intelligent.

1534
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,560
How does torsion...

1535
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,440
Jack, please.

1536
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,880
Well, so one of my favorite subjects...

1537
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,960
Now we're going into heavy pseudoscience

1538
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:10,760
for everyone out there.

1539
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:11,800
So here's what's funny is that...

1540
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,680
This is all fake.

1541
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,000
That's right, brother.

1542
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,120
If you talk about heavy side

1543
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:19,400
as a more fundamental treatment of Maxwell,

1544
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,840
similarly Einstein-Cartin

1545
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,520
is a more fundamental treatment of Einstein,

1546
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,080
because Einstein felt the torsional tensor

1547
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,080
should be treated symmetrically in free space

1548
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,600
and therefore zero out.

1549
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,160
T21 minus T12 equals zero.

1550
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,000
And Eli Cartin came around and said,

1551
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,760
no, you can't make that assumption.

1552
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,200
There could be exotic environments

1553
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,360
where this is a non-zero contributor.

1554
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,040
And so basically the two contributions

1555
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,440
to gravitational force in a geometric context

1556
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,040
are curvature to space-time

1557
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,320
and a twist to space-time.

1558
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,680
So torsion is the twist.

1559
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,080
And what makes that interesting

1560
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,840
from a gravity manipulation standpoint

1561
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,240
is that contents of the torsional tensor

1562
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,520
are the spin density tensor,

1563
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,280
which can contain contributions

1564
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,280
from electromagnetic spin.

1565
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,640
So if you can do really novel things with spin,

1566
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:05,080
either by coupling electron spin to nucleonic spin

1567
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,400
or maybe like you're talking about axial spin

1568
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,880
to harmonic vibratory modes

1569
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,240
that sort of blow up real fast,

1570
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,160
you can maybe generate really large contributions

1571
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,760
to the spin density tensor

1572
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,920
and get these torsional repulsion fields

1573
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,000
that act like gravity, look like gravity,

1574
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,600
but technically they're not exactly gravity.

1575
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,160
No.

1576
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,160
Well, however they can couple to it

1577
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,000
under certain conditions.

1578
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:27,500
Yes.

1579
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,880
So then you could basically,

1580
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,240
this gravity can't traditionally manipulate in a lab,

1581
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,080
so you might be able to manipulate in a lab.

1582
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:38,040
Again, the whole idea of the graviton itself

1583
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,080
being a spin two,

1584
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:43,400
whereas the photon spins one.

1585
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:43,880
Yeah.

1586
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,080
Now in the broader context,

1587
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,160
torsional physics is not a theory of everything.

1588
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,440
It's just going to be a piece

1589
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,280
of a more complete theory of gravity

1590
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:54,680
that slots into some broader theory of quantum gravity.

1591
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,180
Interesting.

1592
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,120
Do you think, oh, so that's fascinating.

1593
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,400
But this would be torsional physics

1594
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,120
a way to manipulate gravity that binds to gravity

1595
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,880
more tightly than traditional

1596
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,120
transverse Hertzian electromagnetic waves.

1597
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,720
Along the lines of multiple tech trees,

1598
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,080
this could be one of those branches

1599
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,760
that's important and significant.

1600
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:13,720
That's fascinating.

1601
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,560
What do you think of, you know,

1602
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,960
you mentioned Greer watching this stuff

1603
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:18,920
and that's sort of inspiring.

1604
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,600
Some of the work did Bob Lazar.

1605
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:21,880
Do you think that he was?

1606
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,120
I think Lazar is right on the money.

1607
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,280
When I, I'll tell you the truth.

1608
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:30,200
When I saw in the super force equation,

1609
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:34,040
C to the fourth divided by big G being the super fourth,

1610
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,440
and that talking as the linear operator really

1611
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:43,240
to the spatial temporal geometric structure,

1612
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:47,480
thereby giving rise to energy density.

1613
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,440
When I saw that, and I remember his words

1614
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,000
that this sports mile is the zip.

1615
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,080
It was 3D printed on space time.

1616
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,080
That's exactly what that equation says.

1617
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,360
So that means that they had the capability

1618
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:06,360
to manipulate the space force at a planckian level.

1619
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:11,640
We'll talk about a physics that we, it's unfathomable.

1620
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:17,720
That's why I'm saying they could, that's, that's.

1621
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,320
This is root access.

1622
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,000
That's pretty well known.

1623
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,960
And so what about his idea of gravity A, gravity B?

1624
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,200
I don't know about that.

1625
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,000
It's occurred to me.

1626
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,640
Maybe it's curvature, gravity, and torsional gravity.

1627
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:30,760
Oh, could be.

1628
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:31,320
Interesting.

1629
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:31,880
I know.

1630
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:35,480
And I don't like encouraging him, but.

1631
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,720
Well, now I've, I've come around.

1632
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:42,040
I never, I never fully rule.

1633
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,880
Logan says that he believes.

1634
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:44,360
Lazar.

1635
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:45,560
So do I.

1636
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,360
I believe Lazar is not.

1637
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,640
I'm starting to too.

1638
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:53,640
Well, I think he was pushed out by Intel.

1639
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,760
Cause John Lear gave the files to George Knapp.

1640
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,800
But, and so maybe it was like at the time

1641
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,400
that the majestic 12 was coming out,

1642
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,600
I think a lot more about the majestic 12 was correct as well.

1643
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,680
And that would maybe go, went by another name

1644
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,000
and there are false names in there, whatever.

1645
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,800
But that's how kind of passage material works.

1646
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,360
That's how, you know, recruiting works where, you know,

1647
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,240
you have to give it a quacky veneer or whatever.

1648
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,840
So I don't quite, you know, maybe believe the story fully

1649
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,560
prima facie, but I think you experience real stuff.

1650
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,000
Yeah.

1651
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
And he was given passage material.

1652
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,600
Maybe some of it was authentic.

1653
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,000
No matter what he did on the side.

1654
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,360
And no matter, don't forget this guy actually knew Teller.

1655
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:35,880
Right.

1656
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,720
Teller did not approach anybody.

1657
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:41,480
There was, so we're talking about one of the greatest

1658
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:42,920
physicists of all time.

1659
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:47,000
If it wasn't for his, his staying with Oppenheimer

1660
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,480
and how much Oppenheimer was loved by the rest of the

1661
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,120
physics community, Edward Teller would be remembered

1662
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,200
forever as one of the geniuses of our time.

1663
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,560
Remember, this is the man that not only is responsible

1664
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:01,320
for the Teller-Wulham device, but for something called

1665
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,680
Project Sundial.

1666
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:03,960
It's unclassified.

1667
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,640
Look into it.

1668
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:08,280
Well, if it's unclassified, so what happened?

1669
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:08,840
Look into it.

1670
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:14,520
Imagine creating something instead of 50 megatons,

1671
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,200
the Russian Tsar Bomba.

1672
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,200
Imagine something billion.

1673
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,180
Whoa.

1674
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,120
Yeah.

1675
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,120
He wanted a hundred gigaton.

1676
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,440
Oh, I don't know why.

1677
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,160
Jesus Christ.

1678
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:28,280
Oh, man was an absolute genius from everywhere.

1679
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,160
Oh, genius.

1680
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,440
He had no limits.

1681
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,280
No, no, he rightly believed.

1682
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:37,640
No, no earth, no, no world in its right mind.

1683
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,760
We're all sane.

1684
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,200
Trust me.

1685
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,440
We are sane as an earth.

1686
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,480
That's why we must come together, unified somehow.

1687
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,040
Calm down with that amount of energy.

1688
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,800
No, no, no.

1689
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:55,480
He believed that no sane world would ever execute such a weapon.

1690
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:58,280
So just the very existence of such a weapon,

1691
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,920
knowing that you have that sword.

1692
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:04,120
This is the sword of Democles.

1693
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:08,360
The man must have been very well versed in the classics.

1694
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:11,880
Sword of Democles, always hanging above your head.

1695
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,400
Nobody is crazy enough.

1696
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,000
We have enough of a sword of Democles in my opinion.

1697
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,920
But what do you think?

1698
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,920
Because you've been talking a lot about Heaviside here

1699
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:27,240
and him being kind of an inspiration for you in a way.

1700
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:27,960
Absolutely.

1701
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,640
I interviewed a Navy scientist,

1702
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,000
another Navy scientist who actually was anonymous

1703
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,600
in my Townsend Brown episode.

1704
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:39,160
He talked about this framework of extended electrodynamics.

1705
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:43,320
So he talked about the original 21 Maxwell's equations

1706
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:46,360
and a more faithful adherence to those equations

1707
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,120
and a quaternary and you know.

1708
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,160
No quaternary.

1709
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,040
Yeah.

1710
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:56,040
Being somehow essential to all these new exotic electromagnetic waves

1711
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,560
beyond the transverse hurting waves.

1712
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:00,520
So scalar wave, scalar longitudinal waves, things like that.

1713
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,880
Do you agree with that model?

1714
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,200
I believe there are many roads that lead to Rome.

1715
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,120
I understand that view because they believe

1716
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:13,480
that truly what we're seeing, again,

1717
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:16,360
the whole idea of the Aronov-Bohm effect,

1718
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,120
the whole idea is that what's true

1719
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,200
is the vector and the scalar potentials,

1720
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:23,480
not the electric field per se and the B field.

1721
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,640
It's the way you look at it, the way you use.

1722
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:31,080
Again, physics should drive the mathematics,

1723
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,360
not the other way around.

1724
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,480
I truly believe that.

1725
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,560
What's interesting is I read a paper recently

1726
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,480
because I've always been skeptical of scalar,

1727
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,920
longitudinal scalar wave theory,

1728
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,240
but I read it primarily because we don't see them.

1729
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:44,280
So the question is, I'm fundamentally an empiricist.

1730
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,040
Yeah, we're already going to see these.

1731
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,440
Well, what's interesting is apparently there's a possibility

1732
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:53,480
of mistaking very small subharmonics in AC waveforms

1733
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:57,160
or I'm sorry, mistaking longitudinal scalar waves

1734
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,200
for subharmonics.

1735
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,640
So the notion was if you expose some kind of a novel matrix,

1736
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,000
something like what we were talking about,

1737
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,480
that this pulls the waveform apart

1738
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:09,640
in the same manner that a prism pulls apart a light wave

1739
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,160
and shows you the different frequencies.

1740
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,640
You might see something novel out of that

1741
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,640
that you're like, wait a second, that's not normal.

1742
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,000
That's perhaps your scalar wave.

1743
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,840
So there's a possible experimental approach

1744
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,240
to verification or discrediting.

1745
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,840
Don't forget the fundamental papers of E.T. Whitaker.

1746
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:32,440
1904, 1905, an English-British mathematician

1747
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:36,280
by the name of E.T. Whitaker writes these two fundamental papers

1748
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,760
whereby he actually shows that scalar waves,

1749
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:45,240
non-Hertzian, so non-transverse waves are feasible.

1750
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,280
Interesting.

1751
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:51,480
As a matter of fact, wasn't it Colonel Tom Bearden that mentioned?

1752
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,560
Yeah, Tom Bearden talks about scalar physics.

1753
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,360
There's a guy now named Lee Kiley who publishes papers

1754
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,680
about wood science and another guy publishes papers

1755
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,960
about extended electrodynamics and these other wave types.

1756
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,640
I mean, these things are not expressly forbidden.

1757
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,200
Anything that's not forbidden by physics is allowable.

1758
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,160
Now, is it engineerable?

1759
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:11,560
Right.

1760
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,200
That depends on the genius of some people.

1761
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,200
You need to polarize the vacuum again, right?

1762
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Because it's all about in the Lorentz equation, right,

1763
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,800
having a sort of a gauge where the scalar vector potentials

1764
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,880
are automatically kind of negated or equal zero,

1765
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:33,880
but back there might actually be a real scalar vector potentials

1766
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:37,160
that are present even if the magnetic field is not present.

1767
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,920
The prosaic explanation for that is electromagnetic four potential,

1768
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:44,200
but a lot of the proponents of extended electrodynamics

1769
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:48,120
say that that actually explains this stuff way better.

1770
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,880
This is why I think condensed matter physics

1771
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,040
is the most exciting field of physics today

1772
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,480
because these things are being interrogated.

1773
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:56,120
And please don't forget Nikola Tesla.

1774
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,680
His idea of radiant energy is based on what?

1775
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,480
Scalar waves.

1776
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:01,480
Scalar waves, yeah, interesting.

1777
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,160
Very interesting.

1778
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,440
What was he?

1779
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,920
He was totally against Hertz, by the way.

1780
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:13,240
Tesla was very outspoken, known to be here anyway.

1781
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,960
Because he thought his own these exotic wave.

1782
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:16,920
Well, he was experimenting.

1783
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,160
Don't forget, Einstein thought that Tesla was

1784
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:23,560
the most intelligent man in the world at one point in time.

1785
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,600
This is Einstein.

1786
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,800
I've never interacted with this.

1787
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,040
I've never consumed Einstein's commentary about Tesla.

1788
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:28,680
That's interesting.

1789
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,680
It's funny, Tesla and Townsend-Brown were doing the same thing.

1790
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,480
Tesla was doing similar stuff to what Townsend-Brown was

1791
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,720
at the end of his career at Wardy, Cliff,

1792
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,080
and in Colorado Springs.

1793
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:42,040
Extremely high voltages across short distances

1794
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:45,240
where you would expect to get these kind of anomalous effects.

1795
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:50,280
Somebody should ask the president-elect about his uncle.

1796
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:53,720
Well, you want to know the one interview with John Trump

1797
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,720
is available in a documentary on the Philadelphia experiment.

1798
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,520
Philadelphia experiment is this wacky,

1799
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:04,040
psi-off experiment with Townsend-Brown involved.

1800
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:07,880
There probably was a real thing going on underneath the veneer,

1801
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:11,560
the fake thing that was distributed that Townsend-Brown actually pulled off.

1802
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,560
But John Trump gets interviewed in this documentary by Bill Moore.

1803
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:20,440
John Trump was tasked with looking through Tesla's files

1804
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,680
when they confiscated him from his apartment in New York.

1805
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:24,680
He was the nationalist.

1806
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,760
He was very close with Vannevar Bush.

1807
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:31,000
If there is a legacy UFO program, John Trump had to obey.

1808
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,920
He was the top radar expert in the country.

1809
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:38,120
I think he even owned a company called High Voltage LLC or something like that.

1810
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:42,120
I believe Tesla physics, quote-unquote, can bring these things down.

1811
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,320
This is our trump card.

1812
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:50,840
I truly believe it's the genius of Nikola Tesla

1813
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:55,640
that will one day help us in the upcoming, let's say,

1814
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,800
if there's such a thing as a cosmic war.

1815
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,920
Oh, you're saying invasion.

1816
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,360
Well, that's what Greer says.

1817
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,560
I don't like to talk about that.

1818
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:04,600
I think that's a bad idea.

1819
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,600
I think we shouldn't mess with the stuff.

1820
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,600
Let them decide.

1821
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,400
Let them decide.

1822
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,000
I think they're way more advanced.

1823
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,800
Again, I believe we have properties.

1824
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,200
Oh, man.

1825
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:20,360
I think they're factions, and I think they're good initiatory factions,

1826
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,680
and then they're bad malevolent, more actively fucking with us faction.

1827
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:29,960
Well, interesting math emerges when you look at the sheer number of galaxies,

1828
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,920
the sheer number of stars per galaxy, the age of the universe,

1829
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,920
the number of emergent species that can emerge from a given planet.

1830
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,920
The numbers blow up very quickly.

1831
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:42,680
So this notion of one, two, three, four species gets really strange.

1832
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,520
Like, why aren't there 25,000?

1833
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,640
Why aren't there 30,000?

1834
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,120
Yeah.

1835
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:52,280
On the nuts and bolts side, I think there are power scaling restrictions in play

1836
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:56,920
that restrict how far you can go with any sort of FTL technology.

1837
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:00,360
But at the same time, I think it informs the political landscape.

1838
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:00,600
Yeah.

1839
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:07,000
Well, we assumed this binary angels and demons or angels for demons.

1840
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:07,240
Right.

1841
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,000
But there's no gray cells.

1842
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,680
Well, you have a hierarchy of being.

1843
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:13,720
It's likely more of a kangaroo and explosion,

1844
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:19,720
more diversity on the food chain above you, maybe even then below you or whatever,

1845
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:25,000
because you have these, you know, all sorts of path dependencies.

1846
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,520
And yeah, so maybe that just gets extremely complex.

1847
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,160
As a counterpoint, Peter Thiel gave a very interesting interview where he talked about

1848
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:38,760
how he thinks there's an argument to the fact that there might be selective forces

1849
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,960
that lead to one very good and one very bad.

1850
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:45,480
And this could give rise to the binary.

1851
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,600
And I ran a space on it and we talked about it and it's very controversial

1852
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,680
because there are people that hate this interpretation,

1853
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:51,800
but I think it's very compelling.

1854
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,360
Well, it's compelling.

1855
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:53,560
But it's biblical.

1856
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,200
It's biblical.

1857
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:54,840
It is.

1858
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:59,000
The war between the children of light and the children of darkness.

1859
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:03,560
That's yeah, if it ever felt apocalyptic, it does now.

1860
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,000
I mean, look at what's going on.

1861
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,480
You look at where the war is actually taking place.

1862
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,200
It's pretty wild.

1863
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,440
It feels like we're in the book of Revelation, but also-

1864
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,720
Truly end of time.

1865
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,520
It's weird.

1866
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:18,440
But like, I think the point he was making was that tech itself is a forcing function.

1867
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:23,000
If you have warp drive tech, if you have faster than light tech,

1868
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,360
you never see it coming.

1869
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:26,840
It's hard to have the defense against that.

1870
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:27,720
That was an excellent point.

1871
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:33,000
And so because of that, you either have to inflict towards this totalitarian,

1872
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,800
total clamp down, one world government state,

1873
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:40,360
or you need to reflect towards complete altruism and heart centeredness.

1874
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,640
And if you have one, maybe you'll be okay with the warp drive tech

1875
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,160
and it will be saving up humanity.

1876
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:50,440
And if you have the other, yeah, you just, you need total control.

1877
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:51,720
But you know, that's not, that's a-

1878
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,160
I hope we don't slip in that direction.

1879
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:59,320
I believe the physics that will win is the physics that's based on creation and destruction.

1880
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:02,280
So Victor Schauber, how do we, how do we get to it?

1881
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:07,400
Cause a lot of this conversation is, you know, it's fascinating and it's mind opening,

1882
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:15,000
but it's also bleak and scary because it's starting to dawn on me just how we live in

1883
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,400
a multipolar world and you have these exotic lineages of physics that

1884
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,640
all of these countries are somewhat privy to.

1885
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,120
And they're, they're very destructive.

1886
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:27,320
And so how do we get to a more generative,

1887
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:33,240
heart centered, positive version of physics and the global landscape?

1888
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:37,240
Many roads lead to Rome, but there's only one Via Appia.

1889
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,280
Only one what?

1890
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:42,760
Via Appia, the one that the aqueduct was built along.

1891
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,480
It was the major road that led to Rome.

1892
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:49,960
So there could be many roads that led to Rome, but there was one of choice.

1893
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,600
I was usually followed by the legions.

1894
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,560
There may be just one way of doing it right.

1895
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,880
Can we find it before something tragic happens?

1896
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,560
What do you think that way is?

1897
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,280
There's that-

1898
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,480
Unification.

1899
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,880
Unification.

1900
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:10,200
But it can't just be a physics solution.

1901
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,360
Can we re-engineer human nature?

1902
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,320
I once asked that of Kurja Mangal.

1903
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,920
I think he's still thinking on it.

1904
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,520
Can we re-engineer human nature?

1905
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,920
That's where the secret of all this lies.

1906
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:28,680
What are we?

1907
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:29,640
Who are we?

1908
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:30,600
What do you think?

1909
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:31,720
I think it's possible.

1910
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:37,880
But again, I think it demands a great effort on our part

1911
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:44,600
to leave our individualistic ways and come together as one collective

1912
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,960
who are willing to live in total equality.

1913
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,960
See, Marx attempted that.

1914
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:51,960
He did.

1915
01:28:51,960 --> 01:29:00,840
And yet, the practice of Marxism resulted in tremendous atrocities, pogroms.

1916
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,400
Well, he was diagnostically-

1917
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:08,440
Then you could say that it was the Leninist uprising and the revolution

1918
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:13,960
that led to Nazism, that led to National Socialism.

1919
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:16,680
So in other words, everything came from trying to

1920
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:21,800
put this idea of equality into practice but in the wrong manner

1921
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,440
because it formed elitism.

1922
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:27,960
Once you have elitism into the equation, you've destroyed everything.

1923
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,960
It's just so anathema to human nature of Marxism.

1924
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,040
Maybe it's sort of diagnostically somewhat correct as far as

1925
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:40,920
how capitalism creates these sort of alienation dynamics or whatever.

1926
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:44,360
But prescriptively, it's just so beyond idealistic.

1927
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:47,320
But isn't it a beautiful thought, the equality of man?

1928
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:53,480
I think man, I don't like meritocracy.

1929
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:56,440
I think it's overused and kind of in an annoying way.

1930
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:59,720
But meritocracy is way better than equality.

1931
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:04,600
The idea that we're all equal outcomes or whatever, that's crazy.

1932
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,880
Maybe some sort of equal footing or opportunity,

1933
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:11,480
but you end up in these sort of never-ending conversations

1934
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:15,240
of how exactly to engineer that in these sort of technocratic ways

1935
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:18,280
that lend themselves actually to power co-option ultimately

1936
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,920
of people that don't even care about those things.

1937
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,120
It's sort of a bait and switch.

1938
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:24,360
I don't know.

1939
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,200
I think it's a really hard conversation.

1940
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,680
If the 20th century was a refutation of anything,

1941
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:32,040
it was a refutation of these technocratic ideologies

1942
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,200
where you could engineer society into anything.

1943
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,880
You had all these utopian ideologies and none of them weren't.

1944
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:44,200
Nazism, Bolshevism, communism, Trotskyist, Marxism, they all failed.

1945
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:48,520
I think it really was a refutation.

1946
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,440
It's the most deadly century we've ever had.

1947
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,200
I don't know how we get out of this,

1948
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,000
but it feels like it has to be a much more individual kind of thing.

1949
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,640
Maybe we need a common enemy from the outside.

1950
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,520
No, that doesn't seem really good or carries that at all.

1951
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,560
You're saying that there would be an enemy from within,

1952
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:06,760
there would be a fifth column,

1953
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:09,000
that there would be people taking their side?

1954
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Well, I think the right thing is to look within.

1955
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:15,960
It's to really, really look at yourself,

1956
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,680
think about who you are and fix what's broken there.

1957
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:23,160
And I think that's probably a better path individually.

1958
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:27,240
I think we've seen enough microcosms of the outside enemy

1959
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:30,680
to assert, unfortunately, that there would be fifth columns,

1960
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,520
in some manner speaking.

1961
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,800
That's what the problem is.

1962
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,080
What do you mean?

1963
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,080
And again, that would only…

1964
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:42,440
There'd be some disruption to the idea of global unity

1965
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:46,680
by way of an external… because the ideology is that there'd be…

1966
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:49,160
So we must go to the most basic of units,

1967
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:51,480
the re-engineering of human nature itself.

1968
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:54,280
Do we have enough self-awareness to do that?

1969
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,920
I don't know if I believe in that in some sort of Psy-op-y way.

1970
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:01,160
Well, yeah, what is an open question?

1971
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:03,160
What do you guys think Reagan meant?

1972
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:04,840
You have rumors, right?

1973
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:06,760
Of like, MacArthur…

1974
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:10,520
Why would he have said it in a plain session of the United Nations?

1975
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:14,840
So this is the story is that Reagan was speaking with Gorbachev.

1976
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:16,360
Gorbachev tells this story.

1977
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:20,280
He says it in an interview, I think with Charlie Rhodes or something.

1978
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,360
Reagan whispers to him right before the conversation starts.

1979
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:28,920
He says, you know, hey, if aliens invaded, would you have our back?

1980
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:33,160
Compadre on that and defend the earth together.

1981
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:35,320
And Gorbachev was extremely taken aback.

1982
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:41,000
Yeah, this idea of kind of astral politics or something.

1983
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,840
Do you think that in this idea of MacArthur, there are rumors that…

1984
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:46,440
I'm interested though.

1985
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:49,720
What was Gorbachev's… was it then the affirmative?

1986
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:50,920
I think it was.

1987
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,880
He said, yes, Mr. President, we would defend you.

1988
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:54,680
He meant it too.

1989
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:59,000
Is that real though?

1990
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,600
I mean, is that like Reagan, like kind of asking for it?

1991
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:07,000
Sometimes you have leaders that are meant to be there at the right time,

1992
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,680
under the right circumstances.

1993
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:11,400
I believe they're born for that particular purpose,

1994
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:17,720
to make sure that earth is not pushed toward the precipice of perdition.

1995
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:21,320
Maybe we're meant to have a certain balance between

1996
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:23,800
the children of darkness and the children of the light.

1997
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:25,480
What do you mean?

1998
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,040
Equilibrium.

1999
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:31,560
And yet everything happens far away from equilibrium.

2000
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:34,680
Everything that's physically important.

2001
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,480
How interesting.

2002
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,760
Well, we're speaking of a mistake.

2003
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:39,400
What's going on?

2004
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:39,880
What do you mean?

2005
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:40,440
I don't know.

2006
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:43,320
Jack, throw some light on this.

2007
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:46,920
Analogously to the Pius effect, which takes place far from equilibrium,

2008
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:52,360
where you can see these novel behaviors.

2009
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,960
In the book, you have average behavior.

2010
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:58,760
You have average outcomes.

2011
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,440
And so he's making an analogy to that.

2012
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:00,760
Well, yeah.

2013
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:03,880
I mean, you have like thermodynamic laws around that.

2014
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:04,600
Right.

2015
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:09,720
And then it does seem like all these exotic effects I get into

2016
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:13,640
are like a result of like quote unquote higher energy physics.

2017
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:18,040
Extremely granular manipulation of materials or whatever.

2018
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:21,160
And so it's like you're pushing the boundary.

2019
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:23,240
It's like you have this...

2020
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:25,720
Ken Wilson was a stern physicist.

2021
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,480
You have this concept of renormalization.

2022
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:31,960
It's really used to describe phase transitions in materials.

2023
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:32,520
But it's like...

2024
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,160
Who was against it?

2025
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:39,240
Someone spoke against that idea saying that it's like

2026
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:44,680
it's like putting infinities under the rug.

2027
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,760
It's like sweeping infinities under the rug.

2028
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:47,720
Was it Feynman?

2029
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:48,680
I don't know.

2030
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,840
But I'm just using really philosophic.

2031
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:51,160
Right.

2032
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:55,160
Just like pushing systems to their logical boundary.

2033
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:56,600
In your case, the Schrodinger, wasn't it?

2034
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,100
Right.

2035
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,480
You get kind of weird effects.

2036
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,480
Like it is a famous quote from Agnew Bonson.

2037
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:06,040
He was sponsoring the Chapel Hill Conference and kind of creates quantum gravity,

2038
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,680
which sends physics down to cul-de-sac and string theory.

2039
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:10,120
Very strange what happened.

2040
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:10,760
Very interesting.

2041
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:14,120
But he's also funding Townsend Brown's work back at the house.

2042
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,280
And he says strange phenomena occur.

2043
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,440
And you have more incredible names.

2044
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:20,680
You have Bryce and Cecil DeWitt.

2045
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:21,160
Yeah.

2046
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,000
You have John Wheeler.

2047
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,800
And you have Lewis Whitten.

2048
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,040
I wanted to ask you, Bryce DeWitt in 1968 writes a paper

2049
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:34,520
about superconductors and gravitational drag.

2050
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,440
Does that connect with your work at all?

2051
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,080
No comment.

2052
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:41,000
All right.

2053
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:41,960
Yeah, I know.

2054
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,480
It's a lot of odd characters there.

2055
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:47,560
The whole conference that was sponsored by Wright Airfield.

2056
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:51,160
So very, very interesting history.

2057
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,240
And Agnew Bonson himself is the patron.

2058
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:57,160
Writes a book about man-made UFOs called The Stars Are Too High.

2059
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:01,240
Actually, it's about this plan to unite the world via this man-made UFO invasion.

2060
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:09,160
But he also says strange things occur at high megavolts across short distances.

2061
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,680
And he's describing Townsend Brown's work.

2062
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:14,040
So it's clear that pushing things to the limit, even plasma itself,

2063
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:15,160
is the fourth energy state.

2064
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:17,640
We can't go beyond that, at least conceptually.

2065
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:25,160
You get some greater truths by pushing the boundaries inside.

2066
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:25,800
So it's true.

2067
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:27,400
It's true.

2068
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,160
Must always push the boundaries.

2069
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:30,760
Yeah.

2070
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,720
But is that this Faustian Promethean thing?

2071
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,800
Are you playing with fire when you push the boundaries?

2072
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:41,320
If tech is an apocalyptic forcing function,

2073
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:46,040
are you imitantizing the eschaton when you do that?

2074
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,160
And is that a bad thing?

2075
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:50,200
It's most certainly a point of inflection forcing function.

2076
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:51,640
That's a great question.

2077
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:52,600
Gorgeous question.

2078
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,120
Thank you, sir.

2079
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:56,360
True.

2080
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:57,720
Jack, you want to attack that one?

2081
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:00,440
It's most certainly a point of inflection forcing function.

2082
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,800
Such that when you approach it,

2083
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:08,200
some black swan event is going to take place.

2084
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:09,880
And I think that's where we talk about things

2085
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:11,320
that are way far from equilibrium.

2086
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,920
These are founder events.

2087
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:18,360
The world is inflecting.

2088
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:20,440
We're in a weird timeline.

2089
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:22,360
Extremely.

2090
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:24,600
Very strange want and time.

2091
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,520
You know, things that there may be.

2092
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:31,160
You know, I've always said this,

2093
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:35,400
and I will hold this to my dying breath.

2094
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:41,640
The whole idea is that I describe matter as condensed,

2095
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:44,280
or rather, how do I say it?

2096
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,640
I say it in a certain way.

2097
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:50,280
Contained energy, or rather, energy that's contained,

2098
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:54,840
that's bound within fields and frozen in a quantum of time.

2099
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,320
You know who believes in?

2100
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:59,400
Confined in a quantum of time.

2101
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,520
That's it, confined.

2102
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:08,200
That came, no joke, out of the quantum vacuum.

2103
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,960
I choose not to use the term ether

2104
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:15,480
because Einstein was so much against the idea of loop,

2105
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:19,160
even though he introduces it in 1921 on a paper.

2106
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:20,920
And everyone gets back on it.

2107
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,240
He says actually the ether is compatible with.

2108
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:26,680
Our orthodox physicists that already believe me

2109
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:29,080
of pseudoscientists and crackpot and stuff.

2110
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:31,400
I don't want to force.

2111
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,640
Do you think that in your lifetime,

2112
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:39,000
on a sort of more mass audience scale,

2113
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,920
you get vindicated in your work?

2114
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:43,560
It's a dream, brother.

2115
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:45,160
It's an absolute dream.

2116
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:49,000
Do you know how many tears and sweat and blood

2117
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,120
and freaking nightmares and sleepless nights I've had?

2118
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:58,840
It just, that's why the Lacknall paper means so much to me.

2119
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,520
That's why I honor that man.

2120
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,080
We're supposed to not like the Russians

2121
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:04,600
and not like the Chinese.

2122
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,040
We're all people, brother.

2123
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:07,480
We're all people.

2124
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:11,800
And that's why sometimes I pray for this external enemy

2125
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,880
because it's the one thing that will create

2126
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:17,080
a forcing function to unify us once and for all.

2127
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:19,640
A united Earth as it should be.

2128
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:23,560
Do you think you should want to know about Russia?

2129
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:24,840
No, please.

2130
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,360
But Putov?

2131
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,080
Absolutely.

2132
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:33,320
Dr. Putov, that paper is one of the papers

2133
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:34,600
that got me thinking.

2134
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:38,600
He's so early on everything.

2135
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,520
He's just implicated.

2136
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:43,400
I'm pretty sure that he's had many a sleepless night, too,

2137
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:47,480
and concerned about what others have thought of him.

2138
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:51,960
Well, he's 88, and he's still completely leeched.

2139
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:55,160
I saw him maybe a month and a half ago or something.

2140
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:57,880
We watched James Stock's documentary together.

2141
01:39:57,880 --> 01:39:59,320
He's just sharp as a tack.

2142
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:01,240
He's just an incredible hick.

2143
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,080
What a mind that man knows of that guy.

2144
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:08,840
Especially when I met him maybe 2018-ish, 2019,

2145
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:12,440
and I felt really crazy and thinking about it a lot.

2146
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:14,040
All this stuff's now in vogue.

2147
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,120
UFO celebrities.

2148
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:20,040
Back then, I felt totally quacky

2149
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:23,800
because I felt a deep resonance with him.

2150
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:26,760
He was the one guy who I felt was somewhat credible.

2151
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:29,400
He's very incredible.

2152
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:33,000
But because the deeper Afghans are so serious,

2153
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,440
I realize he is.

2154
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:35,720
Just for context, for the audience,

2155
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:39,160
Magenta was a rumored crash, I believe, in Bologna, Italy.

2156
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:45,080
That ended up in Italy's hands for the next 11, 12 years.

2157
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:48,760
It was actually rumored to be held at the Vatican at some point,

2158
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:50,200
and then it was transferred over to the US.

2159
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,240
We do think it maybe went to Germany,

2160
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:55,800
but we don't know when, for sure, or whatever.

2161
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,880
But Grush wouldn't speak to when it came here,

2162
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:59,160
it was in Atlanta and all of that.

2163
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:02,760
Some heavy physics there.

2164
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:03,480
It's interesting.

2165
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:06,280
It's possible it was a first one-off vehicle

2166
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:09,080
that we had at some point before Roswell

2167
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:11,640
that was at Wright Field or something like that.

2168
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:14,440
So you think that picture of the...

2169
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:16,520
Because you see pictures of Congress stop,

2170
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:23,000
and Breslau, and Pilsen, and Czechoslovakia, and Poland.

2171
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,600
And you see this tester rig that's shaped like...

2172
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:29,240
It looks like an acorn or a bell or something can be fit in there.

2173
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:30,520
You think they were testing?

2174
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:30,840
Maybe.

2175
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:31,800
The Magenta craft?

2176
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,960
I've heard it's also radioactive on that side.

2177
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:37,880
Also, I mean, why have that shape at all?

2178
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,320
Why that shape in particular?

2179
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:40,280
Yeah.

2180
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:40,920
Given...

2181
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:43,400
And then it was transferred maybe to Wright Pad or something?

2182
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:45,000
Right, like at the end of the war,

2183
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,240
when we got in or something like that.

2184
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:49,080
That would be a very interesting piece.

2185
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:49,800
Or if it wasn't...

2186
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,360
It's scary as shit, though, if it's true.

2187
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:53,880
It's because the implications of...

2188
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:57,000
But so do you think that was a UFO crash?

2189
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:58,760
You don't know.

2190
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:01,400
But like in 1933,

2191
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:05,160
you don't have some sophisticated bell on that you're building.

2192
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:07,000
It's like native brand.

2193
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,240
Again, the Paisa effect, 1890s physics.

2194
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:15,640
So you think people, like maybe Gerloff figured this out?

2195
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:19,800
What I'm worried about is Walter Bosley,

2196
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:23,000
the friend of Dr. Joseph Farrell.

2197
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,240
Walter Bosley, the whole idea of Ninja.

2198
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:26,600
Who the fuck were these guys?

2199
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:29,160
The airship, quote, unquote, mystery.

2200
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:30,120
What's going on here?

2201
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:31,800
Because that's around...

2202
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:33,720
Hedi Sassan, Death Speaks with a Bike.

2203
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:36,120
Yeah, but that's a really quick translation

2204
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:37,400
from physics to engineering.

2205
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:40,120
You think the 1890s airships...

2206
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:42,920
There were some engineering geniuses back there.

2207
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:44,440
Look at Nikola Tesla.

2208
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:46,360
But that would just be wild.

2209
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,720
That's beyond belief to me.

2210
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:49,880
What if it's all fucking connected?

2211
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:52,840
You think it could all be human stuff from the 1890s on?

2212
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:57,240
All of the records could be gone, you know?

2213
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,480
I mean, that's just a crazy cover-up.

2214
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:04,120
And just use the empty craft kind of like a...

2215
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:05,320
Because they never...

2216
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,720
Again, I believe their fucking craft

2217
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:10,040
touches on manipulation of the super force.

2218
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:11,960
How the fuck do you do that?

2219
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:15,400
How do you manipulate something at the planned scale?

2220
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:18,520
How do you keep that secret for 140 years?

2221
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:20,600
That seems great.

2222
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:23,560
They also didn't have a lot of the material technology advances yet.

2223
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,480
Sometimes survival makes you crazy.

2224
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:32,600
They would need some sort of parapsychological read access to control.

2225
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:36,200
They would need the line stuff in order to do it.

2226
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:39,000
Or possibly a brotherhood of the occult?

2227
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,560
Yeah, something like that, like a breakaway civilization.

2228
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:42,200
Like that.

2229
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:45,720
Breakaway civilization, arriving at some insights.

2230
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:49,400
Read up on Dr. Farrell's ideas on a breakaway civilization.

2231
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,400
Also Dolan, don't forget Richard Dolan.

2232
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:57,000
But who in the 1890s would have been privy to heavy-sides insights

2233
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,960
in a way that allowed them to finance the building of these exotic craft?

2234
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:05,160
No, they were some powerful families back then.

2235
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:07,800
I'm not going to name names.

2236
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:09,800
These are still extremely powerful.

2237
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:14,920
Put it this way, it's much better that we know certain names,

2238
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:17,960
but we don't know the invisible ones.

2239
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:23,320
Because touching, even on the invisible one's existence, is not a good idea.

2240
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,120
And in fact, our survival.

2241
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:28,920
And again, none of us here are suicidal.

2242
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:31,240
We love being alive.

2243
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:31,800
Absolute.

2244
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,400
Absolute, yeah.

2245
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,360
That's right.

2246
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:35,480
No, it's, yeah.

2247
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:38,600
Yeah, let's not go there.

2248
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:40,040
Change the direction of this.

2249
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:43,800
All I was going to say was I was in graduate school during

2250
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:47,560
a pulse-icey fusion work.

2251
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:49,560
When I went to a conference to present,

2252
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:54,760
I was introduced to Eric Davis, Hal Pudoff, John DeLay, and Sonny White.

2253
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:56,680
Oh, Sonny White, right?

2254
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:58,040
Now, you shouldn't mention Sonny White.

2255
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,400
During OSAP, it turns out.

2256
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:03,560
Davis was helping write that book at the time for BDP.

2257
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:04,520
What a book.

2258
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:05,160
What a book.

2259
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:07,320
That book opened my eyes, man.

2260
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:11,560
So you think Sonny White was a NASA engineer?

2261
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:13,480
Eagle works, huh?

2262
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:18,120
And he was trying to implement the Alkabir warp drive.

2263
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:22,120
And I think now he's funded by DARPA.

2264
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:24,680
He's a company called Limitless or something like that.

2265
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:26,280
Do you think there's anything to-

2266
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:27,800
Oh, absolutely.

2267
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:30,920
Dr. White is right on the money.

2268
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:31,560
You think so?

2269
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:32,120
Oh, yeah.

2270
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:33,480
Because NASA's-

2271
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:35,640
Have you noticed he hasn't published anything lately?

2272
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:37,560
Always a sign.

2273
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:38,120
Yeah, right.

2274
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,640
Yeah, and I think they said it failed or something.

2275
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:43,560
That should happen right before Ning Li just-

2276
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:46,440
Yeah, interesting.

2277
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:52,120
So this Hampton Langley incursion last year

2278
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:55,080
that we now are understanding happened.

2279
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:56,360
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2280
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:58,200
You have Hampton Air Force Base.

2281
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:01,880
You have a 17-day incursion where it seems like drones

2282
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:04,200
are swarming around the area in our airspace.

2283
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:06,600
We have no defense against this.

2284
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:09,640
It seems like there's maybe a mothership, Chris Mellon said.

2285
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:10,440
There's a mothership.

2286
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:13,240
What do you think about that?

2287
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:14,200
What do you make of it?

2288
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,680
Let me ask one crucial question here.

2289
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:19,640
I don't know why people don't ask these questions.

2290
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:21,000
Fine, safety of life.

2291
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:21,960
Very important, yes.

2292
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:24,200
Was anybody killed?

2293
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:25,160
Yes or no?

2294
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:26,040
I don't believe so.

2295
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:27,640
I don't know that they would.

2296
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:31,880
I mean, if it were, it would be highly concealed.

2297
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:33,640
Do you think maybe?

2298
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:35,320
I don't think anybody was killed.

2299
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,200
There should be an answer to your question.

2300
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,120
I'm not going to go further.

2301
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:41,320
Is it extraterrestrial?

2302
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:42,360
I'm not going to go further.

2303
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:44,200
Interesting.

2304
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:50,120
Again, there's ET tech and there's man-made tech.

2305
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:55,240
Many roads lead to Rome, but there's only one via apia.

2306
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:00,680
If it's adversarial, it's awful, congregational.

2307
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:07,880
And if it's some advanced tech, they've got it way away from their shoulders over our territory,

2308
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:13,720
where it could be down and captured by us and assess attribution, do any reverse engineering.

2309
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:16,840
It's the only reason I'm skeptical of an adversarial origin.

2310
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:19,240
But at the same time, there were witness reports that they could hear about,

2311
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:20,760
that they were like lawn mowers.

2312
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:21,800
There was their audible.

2313
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,800
I'm not going to tell them what we do with that.

2314
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:27,800
Remember the reverse engineering part.

2315
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:32,200
Lazar speaks to this, why he was there to begin with.

2316
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:35,480
He was there as a replacement for someone that had gotten killed,

2317
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:36,200
trying to what?

2318
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,120
Use a blow torch to go through this.

2319
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:44,200
Again, why did they never crack that?

2320
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:49,320
Because they're fucking physics folks to engineering the super force.

2321
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:52,520
I don't think we can do that.

2322
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,800
But I think they're man-made tech that can go around.

2323
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:03,880
And again, the most complex of problems has the simplest of solution, depending on perspective.

2324
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,400
What if we found another perspective?

2325
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:09,800
John is a same problem.

2326
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:18,040
So you have spoken publicly with a guy named Ashton Forbes, who is a big proponent of these MH370

2327
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:20,040
videos.

2328
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:25,080
And these are these videos where you see these three orbs and they seem to circle around.

2329
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:27,160
The MH370 is this Malaysian aircraft.

2330
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:29,880
It was on CNN for a couple of months.

2331
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:35,240
And it seemed like this civilian aircraft carrying passengers just disappeared in the

2332
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,720
Southeast Asian territory.

2333
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:43,560
And this guy, Ashton Forbes, took to Twitter maybe around a year ago saying he thinks this

2334
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:48,840
is man-made tech and that the craft was somehow teleported out of the sky.

2335
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:50,360
What do you think?

2336
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:53,080
Don't forget Dave Rossi's force orb.

2337
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:55,960
That's why Ashton now goes by four orbs.

2338
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:00,440
There must be four orbs.

2339
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:06,920
Remember the whole idea that once you open the black hole, there is a white hole.

2340
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:14,520
But the three orbs would have your three axes, hence your point of origin.

2341
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:15,960
But there must be a destination.

2342
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:17,320
So there must be a fourth orb.

2343
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,400
There must be a fourth orb.

2344
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:23,080
So you think this is...

2345
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:23,960
It's not me.

2346
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:27,720
Dave Rossi came up with this idea that there must be a fourth orb.

2347
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:29,640
I think he's one right on the money.

2348
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:35,240
Dave Rossi is a very interesting engineer that should be looked into as well.

2349
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:36,440
He's very smart.

2350
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:39,400
Why would you teleport a commercial airplane?

2351
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:40,920
And where did the airplane end up?

2352
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:41,960
Or is it the plot?

2353
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:48,040
All I'm saying is when I saw that thing open up, I saw the Pais effect in action.

2354
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,840
And I told Ashton Forbes, that was his first podcast, Hard Truths podcast.

2355
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:56,200
I told him this is the Pais effect.

2356
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:56,840
Oh my God.

2357
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:59,560
So you think we have room to produce secret weapons and projectism.

2358
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:05,320
Those orbs also speak to AGI, artificial general intelligence.

2359
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:06,920
Autonomy.

2360
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:07,880
AI autonomy.

2361
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:12,920
So we're talking about artificial singularity.

2362
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:14,360
I think.

2363
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:15,960
I don't know.

2364
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:17,320
It's funny.

2365
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:22,760
I just interviewed Matthew Pines and he goes, there's an iron triangle.

2366
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:28,040
He goes, AI, quantum, and the grush stuff.

2367
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:34,360
He was talking to somebody who was deep in the national security world or whatever.

2368
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:39,960
The triangle, the connection between those three things is somehow this

2369
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:41,720
incredible technological scene.

2370
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:45,400
Again, cross-domain disciplines coming together.

2371
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:49,080
Fusion of these ideas resounding into what?

2372
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:50,280
Destructive technology.

2373
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:52,280
Exactly what Jack was talking about.

2374
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:53,240
Very interesting.

2375
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:57,000
I hope one day you give your correct name because you're brilliant.

2376
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,320
People should know you as you are.

2377
01:50:59,320 --> 01:50:59,800
You're welcome.

2378
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:05,960
Do you think that any of this stuff makes it into our civil infrastructure?

2379
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:09,960
I mean, we're sitting in decaying.

2380
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:11,240
Weaponization.

2381
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:16,040
By God forbid, a third party, not even a country.

2382
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:18,120
I don't think this is hard to engineer.

2383
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:19,640
Trinity.

2384
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:22,600
Leave it there.

2385
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:27,400
So basically the physics stagnation, we have to, our physics has to be stagnated.

2386
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:36,280
Can you imagine some nut, some effing person that hates the world engineering this?

2387
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:41,480
Well, my hope is that these nano-structuring 3D lattices turn out to be really hard to make.

2388
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:47,720
Interestingly, it would be fabs like TSMC, the two nanometer structures,

2389
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:49,560
you would need sub-nanometer.

2390
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:51,080
You need the sub-extremes.

2391
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:53,480
The extrema is 10 to the negative tenth meters,

2392
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:55,720
whereas the nanometer is 10 to the negative ninth

2393
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:57,320
to manufacture the structures.

2394
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:59,160
But what if there's another way?

2395
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:01,480
What if there's a resonance-based way?

2396
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,040
Of fabrication.

2397
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:06,840
That's not based on material composition.

2398
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:10,840
That's not based on fabrication method or fabrication protocols, procedures.

2399
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:13,080
It's simple.

2400
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:15,320
Interesting.

2401
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:18,440
You don't want a nut to figure that out.

2402
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:20,520
That would be bad.

2403
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,680
That would be a bad day in hell.

2404
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:25,160
Or heaven, either way.

2405
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:28,520
What do you want the world to know?

2406
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:32,040
What sort of message do you have for people out there?

2407
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:33,800
We need to unify, 100%.

2408
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:36,360
Need unification.

2409
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:38,920
We need people to come together.

2410
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:42,840
And if these ideas can bring them together, then so much better for it.

2411
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:47,240
But too many things are dividing us now.

2412
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:49,560
And what we need is a unifying factor.

2413
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:51,800
Do you want to build a UFO to take us over?

2414
01:52:52,760 --> 01:53:00,360
What I want to build is something that can defeat an external enemy,

2415
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:02,360
one that's external to Earth.

2416
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:07,720
So let's say somewhere close to Proxima Centauri, as we're speaking right now,

2417
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:10,440
an alien armada is being formed.

2418
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:17,560
I would like for us, us, everyone in this room to come together

2419
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:25,560
everyone in this room to come together and with other people, bring together our minds

2420
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:27,800
to create in what...

2421
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:36,920
One thing about what Dr. Eric Weinstein is saying is that he thinks that the best of the best,

2422
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:41,080
the greatest physicists should be brought together to come up with these ideas.

2423
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:46,920
I think even Joe the plumber can contribute, given common sense and enough knowledge

2424
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:50,120
As a matter of fact, look at Ashlyn Forbes.

2425
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:54,840
I'm completely surprised what he's been able to achieve in almost a year,

2426
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:57,640
studying this physics on his own.

2427
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:00,360
Look into his podcasts.

2428
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,640
This guy has come up quite a bit.

2429
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:06,520
He does not have a physics, a physics pedigree.

2430
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:14,760
Again, what if Joe the plumber comes up with the greatest physics idea of the month,

2431
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:16,280
whatever that may be.

2432
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:21,080
But one, again, that helps us come together as an earth.

2433
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:26,440
This interview is coming on the backs of congressional hearings.

2434
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:30,920
No, actually it can be seen around the existence of non-human intelligence

2435
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:37,800
and unidentified anomalous phenomena, but also programs thereof housed in the government around

2436
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:42,760
data collection, quarantining these UFOs, tracking them, that sort of thing.

2437
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:47,160
What did you think of the revelation of immaculate constellation,

2438
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:51,160
this idea of this top secret program around UFOs?

2439
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:54,120
Do you mean immaculate constipation?

2440
01:54:55,720 --> 01:55:03,640
Because I believe such little information was excreted from those hearings that one could not

2441
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:09,800
fathom, for example, coming together, unifying these concepts into something that can save

2442
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:13,480
us, Homo sapiens sapiens, from an external enemy.

2443
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:21,160
If we continue on with this trickle by trickle disclosure, this farce, again,

2444
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:27,000
immaculate constipation, we will get nowhere, absolutely nowhere.

2445
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:32,120
Do you think that there are deeper programs than immaculate constellation?

2446
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:38,760
I guarantee that arrow will get nowhere in no time at all.

2447
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:42,040
In other words, nothing will come of it again.

2448
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:46,840
They'll generate another great report that will say absolutely nothing.

2449
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:53,560
There's a Senate hearing this coming week into Arrow's activities and Arrow's recent report.

2450
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:54,520
You should come with it.

2451
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:57,880
That would depend on my higher-ups.

2452
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Because of certain personal issues, I'll need a riot.

2453
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:12,120
If my higher-ups decide, I would be of use, gladly.

2454
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,120
But again, please let someone drive in there.

2455
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:18,440
I need a drive.

2456
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:18,940
That's all.

2457
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:26,840
Dr. Sal Paisos is an absolute honor.

2458
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:28,360
We appreciate you doing this.

2459
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:33,240
The honor was all mine, sir, and please, you are our intellectual equal.

2460
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:40,120
Trust me, certain things you've said during the interview make me say that.

2461
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:41,640
I would not say that otherwise.

2462
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:43,640
I don't just come up with stuff.

2463
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:52,920
Whatever it is, it is a glimmer of hope, and we need all the hope we can have.

2464
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:54,200
I appreciate that, man.

2465
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:55,400
I appreciate the hat.

2466
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:56,040
Wear that.

2467
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:57,080
Yes, sir, please.

2468
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:57,800
Please do.

2469
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:58,300
Yes.

2470
01:56:59,080 --> 01:56:59,960
Looks really good.

2471
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:02,600
Looks good, brother.

2472
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:03,000
All right.

2473
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:03,500
All right.

2474
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:06,040
All right, bro.

2475
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:14,920
Ian.
