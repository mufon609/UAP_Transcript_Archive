1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
There's something that looks like it has been sliding into the ocean.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,440
So they found this thing that looked like a crashed UFO

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,840
or looked like an artificial structure outside the Swedish coast.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,200
They found that it was covered in burned biological material,

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,000
which is really weird because we don't have volcanic activity in that area.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,120
We need the actual physical proof.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,960
And I don't think any government is willing to release that.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,400
But the scientists who had claimed it was just a rock never studied the actual samples.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,080
And there's no paper and no open data.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,560
There's just a claim to the media by those scientists.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,320
And I'm just like, this is not a way of analyzing something.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,320
Wow. So if there's there are no samples of that object because it was so hard

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,120
so they couldn't get a piece out of it.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,040
So I still think it's something that should be analyzed

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,640
because it might be possibly the best candidate

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,200
and non-human artifact that you can find. Wow.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:05,400
And I really believe that we need to seriously study these kind of objects.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Yeah, absolutely.

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,120
I'm here with Dr. Beatriz Villarreal, who is a phenomenal astronomer,

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,480
both in a conventional sense.

21
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,680
She's conventionally trained, but also I think you are a rare,

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,240
kind of very open mind in your field and you found some very interesting things.

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,240
And so I'm really excited to speak with you because you're kind of on the frontier.

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,120
You're the intersection, I think, between scientific rigor

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,200
and this burgeoning field of studying kind of anomalous phenomena in the air and in space.

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,920
And so thank you for being here. I really appreciate it.

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,240
It's my pleasure. And it's a true honor.

28
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,480
Oh, well, thank you. How did you get in this space to begin with?

29
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,160
Were you always in the space as a kid?

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,240
Actually not. So as a kid, I was a very, very curious person.

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,680
Well, I am still a very curious person, but of course I was very interested in space.

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,800
So I was very curious about a lot of things. And I think already when I was six or seven,

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,800
I had written a small little essay about cats in flying saucers.

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,760
I still like cats as well.

35
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,280
When you were six or seven, you wrote an essay.

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,080
Yeah, I had that essay. I don't remember how long it was.

37
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,640
I had also painted the cats and the flying saucers there.

38
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,080
So I don't think I changed too much.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,720
Oh my God. That's unbelievable.

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,760
Anyway, I simply liked probably this topic already since I was very young.

41
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,680
I got interested in molecular biology and DNA.

42
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,720
And I actually started my university studies with an engineering program

43
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,080
in molecular biotechnology. And then I got super bored.

44
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,240
How did you get bored of molecular biotechnology?

45
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,720
Well, it's like we were all the time. I think it was the particular program

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,880
I was studying at the university. We were all the time repeating the central dogma

47
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,520
and how DNA turns into a protein over and over.

48
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,880
And I just started wondering about the mysteries of the universe,

49
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,040
galaxies, how are galaxies gaining the shapes that we see,

50
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,480
the spiral form versus the elliptical forms. I wanted to understand all that.

51
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,200
Well, I found myself on a PhD program in astronomy and I started studying active

52
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,600
galactic nuclei, which are galaxies that have lots of light coming from their center.

53
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,040
And I tried to see how different types of active galactic nuclei,

54
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,120
and you could see these different types by looking at the spectra.

55
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,920
Some had broad emission lines, some had narrow. And how are they related?

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:06,600
And I did my PhD on that topic. However, already like in my early years as a PhD student,

57
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,760
was it even maybe in my last year as undergraduate student, I had,

58
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,400
while writing some fable, I had started wondering about if a star could vanish,

59
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,560
or if a galaxy could vanish.

60
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,600
What do you think sparked that question of could a galaxy vanish?

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,800
Well, I think I was so influenced and fascinated by Halton Arp's theory.

62
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,560
So Halton Arp was an astronomer who was a super famous astronomer.

63
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:44,840
For a very long while, who one day observed, he found couples of galaxies that looked like

64
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,320
they were exchanging gas. But if you looked at their redshifts, which are indicators of distance,

65
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,360
they had completely different redshift, which completely went against all the idea of the

66
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,600
expanding universe and how we interpret redshift. So when he said this, all astronomers attacked him.

67
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,520
It was the controversy of what we have today with Avi Loeb and Oumuamua, and in the 80s,

68
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,000
with the non-cosmological redshift or anomalous redshifts, as we call them.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,160
Yeah, so I was fascinated by that thing. And I wrote an essay based on these ideas. And then

70
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,880
somehow I killed off my poor quasar because it was a fable. And it vanished at the end of the story.

71
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,760
And I started wondering, but hey, has anyone ever searched for galaxies or stars that vanish?

72
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,160
Interesting. And so can you explain what a non-cosmological redshift is?

73
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:42,360
So it would be, so usually when we look at galaxies, we can see the redshift,

74
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,120
and it's a Doppler shift because the universe is expanding and it's moving away from us.

75
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,200
So it's stretching light and you're moving lower down on the electromagnetic wave spectrum towards

76
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,520
the low nanometer range.

77
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,320
Exactly. So what then happens is that people use this redshift to calculate the distance

78
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,800
through a galaxy. Now the problem would be if you have two interacting galaxies that are

79
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,120
completely different redshifts, you wouldn't be able to use that as a distance estimator.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,160
So I was just curious about that.

81
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,680
Why do you think it was so controversial?

82
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,640
Well, because that would question the entire Big Bang idea. So it would completely change

83
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:33,480
all the fundamentals of physics as we know today, or cosmology rather.

84
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,000
So the verdict on redshifts is still out, but you've moved on.

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,880
I moved on.

86
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,080
You might come back at some point.

87
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,040
When I get really bored.

88
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,240
So how did you get into, because I know you through my own interest in UAP,

89
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:54,360
unidentified anomalous phenomena, how did you get into even believing that that was possible?

90
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,560
So I'm going to show you some like contradictions in how I were thinking when I was younger.

91
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:09,560
So as an undergraduate student, I was in Sweden and I one day heard about this fascinating discovery

92
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,640
that our team of divers had done called the Baltic Sea Anomaly. So they found this thing

93
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,520
that looked like a crashed UFO or looked like an artificial structure outside the Swedish coast.

94
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,320
What did it look like?

95
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,080
It looked like a Millennium Falcon that had just crashed into the deep seas.

96
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,560
Wow.

97
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,960
I was super fascinated and I was like, oh my God, can there have been aliens coming to visiting on

98
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,640
earth? Later, when I started working with these searches for extraterrestrial intelligence,

99
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,920
which we did through the project by looking for vanishing objects,

100
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:53,160
that's when I started wondering about the UFO question as well, which I until then didn't want to touch.

101
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,200
And is there any government interest when it comes to this?

102
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,920
Well, I don't know about that, but I know that they did super interesting investigations of it.

103
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:09,640
I think they found that it was covered in burned biological material, which is really weird because

104
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:15,080
we don't have volcanic activity in that area. Plus, I don't think they even said it was a

105
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,360
crashed UFO. I think their idea is that this is an artificial structure and they don't know what it

106
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:28,920
is, but some kind of artificial structure. There's something that looks like it has been sliding into

107
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:34,680
the ocean. Sadly, Fox News went out with saying that this is just a rock, but the scientist who

108
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:41,960
had claimed it was just a rock never studied the actual samples. And there's no paper and

109
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,360
no open data. There's just a claim to the media by those scientists. And I'm just like,

110
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:54,440
this is not a way of analyzing something. So there are no samples of that object because

111
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,040
it was so hard, so they couldn't get a piece out of it. So I still think it's something that

112
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,880
should be analyzed because it might be possibly the best candidate and non-human artifact that

113
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:15,800
you can find. And I really believe that we need to seriously study these kinds of objects.

114
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,800
HOFFMAN Yeah, absolutely. We should go down there and try to gather resources.

115
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,520
I mean, that's amazing.

116
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,200
LESLIE I hope these two guys will get all the support they can to actually

117
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,040
study it and research it.

118
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,200
So how does looking at vanishing stars then lead you to an interest in UAP or UFOs?

119
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:40,360
So we were looking for these vanishing stars. And so now people talk about vanishing stars

120
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,680
sometimes in different ways than I talk about them. So we had access to these catalogs,

121
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,040
like lots of imagery from 1950, and also a catalog called the U.S. Navy catalog.

122
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,960
And then we had images of the sky as it looks today. And so we were comparing these images

123
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:06,360
from the early 50s to images as it looks today. And I was hoping to see this perfect sparkling

124
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,240
star that you can find in multiple images that one day vanishes. But before you find that,

125
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,560
you find lots of candidates and like things that you see in the 50s that have vanished,

126
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:22,120
but you don't know if it's a beautiful star or if it's something else. I had this image

127
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,640
where you could see multiple stars appearing and vanishing, which is completely crazy. Because

128
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,960
one thing to have one transient, but when we have several of them happening in a small space at the

129
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,440
same time, you really start wondering. So I started studying this phenomenon. I showed it

130
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:44,920
to my colleagues and we all started investigating it. We had this guy at Gran Telescopio Canaria,

131
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,640
one of my friends, who actually pointed the world's largest optical telescope, a 10.4 meter

132
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,480
telescope, to the positions of all these nine objects or eight of them or something like that.

133
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:06,120
And there was nothing left. We were really hoping to see some kind of counterpatch there.

134
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,880
And you said, oh, maybe there were nine lasers or whatever. There was nothing like that. And then

135
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,320
we started wondering, so what can actually cause this thing? And there's no astrophysical

136
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,720
explanation. So we started looking at various kind of instrumental explanation and all of them.

137
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,600
And this is not a supernova or like, you know, the heat death of the sun type thing turns into

138
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,560
a black hole or dwarf or something. You're not going to get several of them in a small space

139
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,560
at the same time. Wow. So this just didn't match anything. Just like perfect anomaly basically.

140
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:44,200
Yeah. Although today you can have that in the sky because today I have lots of satellites

141
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,320
that sometimes are blinking and lots of space garbage. And then short reflections just happen

142
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:57,880
due to, I mean, because you have solar reflections. The problem is that this is from 1950.

143
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,920
We didn't have any of that technology back then. Yeah. So, and that's how I became interested.

144
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:13,640
And I got an idea of that one of the ways how I can also search for more such examples by looking

145
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,720
for those that are lying along a line or in a narrow band. So my friend Lars helped me to develop

146
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:27,960
the statistics to properly see how many do we need at least in a line in order to, or in a narrow

147
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:34,040
band in order to say that even if you have this kind of transits, also their positioning is

148
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:41,240
anomalous and that they are kind of not randomly placed, but they are aligned or so. And we had

149
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:48,200
two such examples that are statistically significant. And one is five objects on a narrow band

150
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,720
and it's from the 27th of July, 1952. My colleague Enrique found these three stars,

151
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:05,080
triple transients. And this one is from the 19th of July, 1952. And it's super beautiful. And then

152
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:12,120
my colleague, Dave Altman, who is the manager, a media manager for Vasco, he said, do you know

153
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:19,400
what happens or what happened on 19th of July, 1952? No, I wasn't around. So he introduced me

154
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:27,080
to the Washington flap. That's absolutely amazing. I mean, because in UFO lore,

155
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,720
not even lore, this was a national event. It was all over the press. It was in newspapers saying,

156
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,640
saucers on the White House lawn. It prompted a call between Truman and Edward J. Ruppelt,

157
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,800
who was the head of Blue Book at the time. And you had this Washington invasion or DC flyover

158
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,680
where there were saucers all over DC at the time. And it was specifically, it was July of 1952,

159
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,440
but it was specifically two weekends. It was the 19th and 20th and it was the 26th and 27th. So

160
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,440
I find that absolutely remarkable. So these are naval records that you're looking at to see the

161
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,640
stars. We used this naval observatory catalog initially, or I used them initially, but later

162
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:13,320
we just went directly to the Mount Palomar images. Got it. And so you're seeing images,

163
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,480
you're seeing this three in a row and then five in a row in your case.

164
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,640
The three are just randomly placed and the five are along a narrow band.

165
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:28,680
Okay, got it. And then they just seemed to vanish. They weren't in the public re-observable data like

166
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,400
a year later or even a week later. Exactly like you said.

167
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,920
That's wild. I mean, that's really fascinating. Is there anything that is distinct about them

168
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,680
when comparing them to other stars in the images or do they look like garden variety stars?

169
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:49,320
They look like garden variety stars. We actually now are re-exploring whether they look identical

170
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,440
to the garden variety stars or if there might be some small tiny difference because you can

171
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,040
expect slight differences if you have short flashes depending on the shorter they are,

172
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,480
the more they might be concentrated. Interesting. And have you seen any vanishing

173
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,560
stars since 1952? Have you combed through the records since then?

174
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,480
We have a lot of single transients, but what I actually want to do is to look at more cases

175
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,240
of multiple transients. We have some more cases when we were looking for these alignments that

176
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,200
we just ignored because we were looking for alignments. Can you describe the methodology

177
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,880
of Project Vasco? What exactly are you doing? So we take images from Mount Palomar

178
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:40,920
from the early fifties and then we look at the same positions in new images from pan stars.

179
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,840
And Mount Palomar is an observatory in California?

180
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:52,280
Exactly. And then we use these images from Hawaii and we compare the same spot just 70 years later

181
00:15:52,280 --> 00:16:00,280
and see how something vanished. It was actually quite fun. There was an expert in satellites that

182
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,760
contacted me when he saw our paper where we were looking for these alignments and I found these

183
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,840
two particularly interesting cases. And he wrote me something like, but come on,

184
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,680
you have just found satellites. Haven't you thought about that? And I wrote back,

185
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:23,640
did you look at what year these satellites are from? They're kind of before Sputnik.

186
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
Yeah. I think that's kind of hard to argue with.

187
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:32,200
It was quite fun. And you can't imagine how often some astronomers actually make that kind

188
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,840
of comment. Aren't you just having satellite links? Do you remember Don Menzel? Do you know

189
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:42,360
that name by any chance? Yeah. Famous astronomer. It's my favorite typical

190
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,320
arch villain. He kind of is, right? It was all like, what was it? Like temperature inversion.

191
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:55,240
He was a Harvard astronomer and I think he was also a cryptographer and kind of deep in the

192
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,720
national security state. And he would just write these kind of naysayer debunking books in the

193
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,160
fifties. And he would describe all the stuff, you know, light reflections or, you know,

194
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,160
temperature inversions and that sort of thing. But yeah, what are your thoughts on it? Why is

195
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,440
he your favorite villain? I mean, I don't think he necessarily is a villain, but there's some very

196
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:25,000
interesting coincidences around his name that really make me wonder. What are the coincidences?

197
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,960
Well, first, I mean, we all know that he was a super famous UFO debunker, if not the most

198
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:39,080
famous UFO debunker. Absolutely. And he helped the US Air Force to debunk the Washington 1952 flap.

199
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,320
And two or three months after, he suddenly becomes the director of Harvard Observatory

200
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:50,600
and he destroys one side of the photographic place. And he doesn't ask, as I understand from

201
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,240
the record, he doesn't ask the astronomers to select the place. No, he asked his secretary

202
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,240
to go and throw away one third of the plates. And there's a woman, Dorit Hofleit, that has been

203
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,600
telling about the story in her memoirs. And kind of he started revenging on her later too for,

204
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,000
as I understood it, for that she tried to protect some of the plates. He also threw away

205
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:19,160
a number of the blog books that are keeping the observations and what plates exist.

206
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:26,120
In 1953, Donald Menzel also stopped the astronomers at Harvard to carry out their

207
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,840
very famous sky survey, where they were monitoring the entire sky since already

208
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:40,280
late 19th century. And he stopped them and they didn't do this survey between 1953 to 1967

209
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:47,480
for roughly 15 years. So he also had apparently some more later episodes of

210
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,960
plate destruction, I've heard. That is wild. And suddenly you find that his name is famous

211
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:01,080
for the so-called MJ-12, Majestic 12. And you start wondering, of course, I mean, I can't help

212
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,520
it, but it's a lot of coincidences because we also see things on these dates from Mount Palomar.

213
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,240
Well, the other fascinating thing about Don Menzel is he went on to run the Bureau of Public

214
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:18,040
Standards, which they're sort of codifying time zones, but also a lot of astronomical data as

215
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,920
well. And so if anybody were to manage our reality, it would be somebody in that position.

216
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,240
And then, I don't know if you know this fact, this is kind of trippy, but he had an understudy,

217
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:34,360
a PhD at Harvard who studied right under him named Lou Branscombe. Lou Branscombe gave Edward Condon

218
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,640
his clearance back and Edward Condon went on to do a hit job on UFOs with the Condon Committee,

219
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,240
which killed Blue Book. So it was literally Menzel's like protege giving Condon his clearance

220
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,160
so that he could completely kind of put the kibosh once and for all on UFOs and kind of kill the

221
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:58,040
field. He's my favorite arch villain. Yeah, I think he's an arch villain. I think there's

222
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,800
something going on there. And we were talking in the car earlier about Carl Sagan, who I think is

223
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,760
such a fascinating figure because we were saying in his early diaries, he would write all about

224
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,280
UFOs. He was clearly sort of fascinated by them. It feels like if you read Pale Blue Dot or Watch

225
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,600
Contact, he sort of, it seems like this tongue in cheek reference to actual non-human intelligence

226
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,760
or extraterrestrial visitation. But then publicly, he just seems to dogmatically flip on the topic

227
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:32,040
and just become this kind of debunker. Actually, right around the time when J. Allen Hynek kind of

228
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,640
goes in the opposite direction, he was running Blue Book and Astronomer and he says, you know,

229
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,800
actually, I played a part in the cover-up. And so it's interesting that Carl Sagan, there seems

230
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,400
to be this kind of split between his private life and beliefs and public life on UFOs.

231
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:54,120
So do you know that Allen Hynek worked under Menzel at Harvard? So there was this project called

232
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:01,000
Operation Moonwatch held by Fred Whipple. So Fred Whipple was the PhD student of Donald Menzel.

233
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:10,040
And so he created this program where they had 12 stations around the Earth with a lot of

234
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:17,000
citizen scientists that were tracking satellites over the sky. And so Allen Hynek was helping

235
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,480
Whipple in this program. And they actually had 36 UFO reports that I think Jacques Vallée found

236
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,760
that we now also look through. There are some very interesting things there. So astronomers

237
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,760
and amateur astronomers have been seeing UFOs forever. It just has been ignored.

238
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,600
Do you know who's running the Harvard Undersea Observatory at the time?

239
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,400
Galileo Project.

240
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,840
Currently, maybe. But the guy at the time was Robert Sarbacher.

241
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,760
You know those moments in the middle of the day when you feel your energy dipping

242
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,560
and you just need something to help you reset. That's when I grab my greens and it's become

243
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:00,040
my favorite way to recharge. Greens is a refreshingly delicious blend of 14 essential greens,

244
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,720
adaptogens, antioxidants, and even mushrooms. It's packed with everything your body needs to fill

245
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:11,800
key nutrient gaps and keep you feeling your best without relying on coffee or sugary snacks.

246
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,280
I personally love the strawberry kiwi flavor. It's tangy, slightly sweet,

247
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,640
and way better than any other green powder I've tried before. Plus it's so easy to make. I just

248
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,600
mix a scoop with water during that midday slump and it's like hitting the refresh button on my day.

249
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,440
Since adding greens to my routine, I've noticed I feel more energized,

250
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,240
less stressed, and just way more balanced. It's a simple step that makes a big difference in how

251
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,400
I feel throughout the day. So prioritize your health this year with up to 35% off bean greens.

addictive chemical. Thanks so much to Lucy for sponsoring today's episode.

270
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:37,560
Who David Grush says went on to basically create UFO secrecy through the Atomic Energy Act of 1954

271
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:43,160
and was very close confidant with Thomas Townsend Brown who's working on anomalous gravity research.

272
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,480
And so it seems like Harvard was the epicenter of a lot of this interesting work.

273
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:54,440
It seems so fascinating to have been at Harvard in the 1950s. And actually, the same time as Menzel

274
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,880
was there, JFK was on the board of overseers for the astronomy department.

275
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,080
I didn't know that.

276
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,440
I first found that in Stanton Friedman's notes. So I'm fascinated.

277
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:12,840
That's amazing. Yeah, I've always wondered how much. Do you think JFK was maybe privy to the UFO?

278
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,040
Because there's this letter.

279
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:21,080
I don't know anything about JFK. All this is outside my specialty. I'm now wildly speculating.

280
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,680
Really speculating.

281
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:29,400
That's what we do on my show. But there's a letter that was FOIA'd.

282
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,160
The Freedom of Information Act was used to request it out of the government in 2005.

283
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:41,560
And it was from JFK to acting director of the CIA, John McCone. It was after JFK had

284
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:48,200
fired Alan Dulles. And he's asking for data on unknowns because he's worried that the Russians,

285
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,120
the Soviets might view it as a threat if they see the unknowns in their airspace.

286
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:58,200
And I would think it was fake, but it really dovetails with the language that was used in

287
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,880
the 1971 SALT talks, where on record we're saying that we have to coordinate with the Soviets

288
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,640
on unknowns in their airspace and our airspace, especially around sensitive military installations,

289
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,560
so that these things don't provoke war. And if you're thinking about detente,

290
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,680
that's obviously a really important vector to kind of think about.

291
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,560
And so I always ask myself, you know, this guy, John Greenwald, blackvault.com,

292
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:27,000
has done a lot of work on this. And he's looked into the veracity of this document.

293
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,520
And the verdict's still out. It's unclear. And I think there are a lot of reasons to think it might

294
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:38,760
not be real. But it's interesting because there were some people in and around the JFK assassination

295
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,040
that think that maybe it had something to do with his inquiries in the UFOs. I don't know.

296
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,280
There's a lot of fascinating questions to explore for sure.

297
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,880
But that's really interesting. I didn't know he was, I mean, I know he was the Harvard

298
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,000
affiliated. I had no idea he was at all involved in anything they were doing in the world of

299
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,680
astronomy. That's really fascinating and cool. What is the current, so you did Project Vasco,

300
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:08,440
and now you're onto a new project to get more of a smoking gun possibly around these anomalous

301
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,360
objects. Can you describe what that project is? So we still have Vasco running and we are going

302
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:19,240
to be looking for more signatures of satellites with the Vasco project. And hopefully also make

303
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,720
a new citizen science project where we look for these signatures. Was that the extent of

304
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,320
the vanishing stars just the 1952 or you found a lot of vanishing? Well, we found a lot of

305
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,880
transients things that appear and vanish. Okay. Okay. So what exactly do you hope to do with

306
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:40,120
Exoprobe? If you remember with the Vasco project, when we saw these multiple transients, there were

307
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,800
no satellites in the sky. Today there's loads and loads of space debris. So now what we want to do

308
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:54,120
is that we want to look for these kind of signatures of non-human artifacts in orbit

309
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:01,000
around the earth, outside the earth's atmosphere. But we also want to remove all this contamination

310
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,760
from human space debris directly when we do our observations so that we get clean data.

311
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,880
So to do that, first we have a method that I cannot discuss how we are removing all this

312
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:18,440
space debris. But more importantly or equally importantly is that we are hoping to build a

313
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:25,800
network of telescopes. And by having multiple telescopes, you can determine the distance

314
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,840
to an object. And the more telescopes you have, the more accurately you can actually

315
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:37,400
determine this distance in three dimensions so that you can actually eventually go there,

316
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,720
pick up the object and bring it down to the earth. Because that's what I would like to do,

317
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:49,080
to bring down an actual ET probe. So that's what Exoprobe is about. It's about validating a finding,

318
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,360
verifying it, localizing the object and characterizing the nature of it. Since the

319
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:01,560
1960s, we have developed a new way of imaging the skies, new technology for imaging the skies. We

320
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:09,720
don't use photo emulsions anymore like was done in the 50s. Our cameras are much more sensitive.

321
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:16,680
We have also artificial intelligence that can analyze a huge amount of data. We can now digitize

322
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:24,280
the entire sky. That wasn't possible in the 60s. All that was impossible for them that time

323
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:31,080
or extremely difficult. And today you have all the methods you need to look for probes.

324
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:40,360
So now since Radio SETI has failed, why not going back to the second best idea of those times,

325
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,920
which is looking for artifacts and probes from advanced civilizations. And I think that's the

326
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:53,640
route we have to take. And I also believe that instead of looking for anomalies blindly,

327
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:00,200
we should look specifically for artificial non-human objects. That's how I'm thinking.

328
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:07,400
I think it's an error to do UFO projects too open where you look for anything that doesn't match

329
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,560
whatever is natural or earthly. I think we need to be much more concrete with what we

330
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,000
are looking for. If we're looking for metallic orbs, you design a project designed for looking

331
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,920
for metallic orbs. That makes so much sense. We were talking earlier and there are certain

332
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:31,560
projects out there that kind of just use generic, you know, a lot of sensor modality, kind of

333
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,040
constant observation, and then just the exclusion principle. And it's like, okay, there are all

334
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,120
these objects. We do recognize what lies outside of the scope of what we recognize.

335
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,480
And you presented this really interesting kind of model, which updated me where it was like,

336
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,760
no, you actually need a hypothesis going in. That's actually really good. That's good science.

337
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,400
Having an idea of what you're looking for and then whatever signatures you'd expect to see

338
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,440
from that thing and actually looking for that precisely. And so I guess the question for you

339
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:07,000
would be in the case of UAP or UFO, do you have specific signatures you might be looking for?

340
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,640
Yes, we are looking for either solar reflections that can be short or it can be streaking or we

341
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:19,880
look for emissions from artificial objects. We simply want to look for these very distinct

342
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:26,600
signatures. And like one discussion I have in a new manuscript that we put out is that

343
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:33,560
I don't like the definition of UAP because it fits almost everything now. It's so broad.

344
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,920
UFO is more limited object.

345
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,320
Yes, but even better is flying saucer. Because when you have flying saucer,

346
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:48,040
you directly can see the flying saucer in your head. But when you can see it in your imagination,

347
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:55,000
you can imagine how it would look in your data. That you can directly transfer it to an image

348
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:01,400
in your mind makes it possible to design a scientific experiment that is very clearly

349
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,160
looking for these flying saucers. Now I'm not saying that you should only look for flying saucers

350
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,760
because we know about the metallic orbs and all these other possible signatures we can look for.

351
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:18,360
But having it so concrete makes it possible to also not only imagine the experiment,

352
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:25,640
but also imagine all the ways how it could fail and all the limitations of your design.

353
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,560
While when people work with exclusion principle and look for everything that doesn't fit

354
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,280
the earthly or the natural, you have so many things you have to test.

355
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,360
You can always go on forever and say, and what will you actually prove from that?

356
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,320
You just prove that there's a bunch of stuff outside of what you'd expect, but you're sort

357
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:54,440
of using process of elimination forever. Exactly. So it's a barely falsifiable

358
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,080
hypothesis. While if you have the flying saucer, it's a very concrete hypothesis.

359
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:05,320
So I think my feeling is that more science projects have to be working

360
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,400
with very concrete hypothesis around the UFO question.

361
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,360
So when you say you're looking for light reflections and light emissions,

362
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:22,440
is that specifically like in a specific light wavelength or is it other possible

363
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,760
signatures or is it just light? Well, you can look all over the

364
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:33,400
electromagnetic spectrum. I'm going to start in the optical, but I think the infrared

365
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,320
might be very, very interesting. I've heard a lot of people commenting on that there are many more

366
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:48,680
UFOs in the infrared. However, I'm a little bit skeptical because our eyes are trained with the

367
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:56,680
optical. I mean, we are all the time judging an object, what it is based on optical light.

368
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,320
When people look at infrared imagery, they don't have that same experience.

369
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,440
So I think it's much easier to find a UFO simply by the lack of experience. It doesn't mean that

370
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:14,760
they are more visible in the infrared. It could just mean that we are worse at identifying objects

371
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,720
in the infrared. Because one example would be, you're familiar with the Nimitz case in 2004,

372
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,120
the Tic Tac. So that was detected right when a forward looking infrared new system from Raytheon

373
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:33,560
was installed on the Nimitz carrier strike group system or whatever. And so people hypothesized

374
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:40,760
that that aperture allowed them to see the UFO. And if UFOs are moving like we think they might

375
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,800
move, you'd expect light stretching or light crunching. And so in the light stretching case,

376
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,560
you'd get red shifts and infrared would be probably better. And then in the light crunching case,

377
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,320
if it was moving towards you, you'd see UV. And so maybe these are good detection methods.

378
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:07,560
I guess we will discover. We have to do more infrared surveys and simply search for UFOs in it

379
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,840
or search for flying saucers in it, like I rather suggest. I think there has been also

380
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:24,600
a certain misdirection when people try to answer the question, what are UFOs? Because you have all

381
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,800
these UFO reporting groups that spend lots of time trying to say, what are UFOs? And they say,

382
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:37,800
oh no, 3% of the time it's birds and 10% of the time it's insects. And they go on.

383
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,120
I think it's an irrelevant question. The only question that should matter is like,

384
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,040
are those that would push the edge of science, which is for example,

385
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,120
are there non-human intelligence on our planet? That's the relevant question to answer,

386
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:01,320
not what are UFOs and what is all falling into that category. So if you say, is there some

387
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,920
non-human technology that we see available? That's a relevant question. The relevant question is of

388
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:18,120
course also if UFOs have some kind of medical effect on people or are they proposing a hazard

389
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:24,200
to pilots or to people on the sea. These are relevant questions, but just the question,

390
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:31,320
what are UFOs? It's too broad. Have you ever experienced, because you are going out on a limb

391
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:39,880
and even looking into this stuff, you, Avi Loeb, a few other astronomers of serious pedigree

392
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:47,320
are even entertaining this. Have you experienced any blowback for what you're doing? Yes, I have.

393
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:54,200
So far not come in the form of direct complaint on my choice of topic from astronomer colleagues.

394
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:03,720
They have been too busy with attacking me for my choice of collaborator. So in 2021, when we did

395
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,960
this discovery of the nine transients, I published a paper with my colleague, Jeff Marcy. So he had

396
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:21,400
been canceled in a sexual harassment scandal in 2015. But he kept on publishing papers and

397
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:28,920
everything kind of, I mean, even if he retired himself, but he still published papers and

398
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:37,160
collaborated with scientists. Except for that the same week as we got our paper accepted into the

399
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:44,840
journal, suddenly the national academy of sciences decided to kick him out of the national academy

400
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:51,160
of sciences. So he was removed from there. And then science and nature published papers about it.

401
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:57,560
And everyone said, who is still collaborating with Jeff Marcy? And we had the paper already

402
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:03,880
accepted. And I remember someone like calling me and saying, don't make any press release

403
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,960
because otherwise you're going to get seriously attacked. That's wild. So since then I got kicked

404
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,040
out of conferences. They find all kinds of ways to like not letting me talk, forgetting my

405
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:25,480
registration. I had social media attacks. I'm going to work with a scientist because he's

406
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:34,760
fantastic simply. And I believe in human rights. And that's my thing that I don't understand that

407
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:44,600
people should be like, the idea of that one condemns a person outside of the court in a

408
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,360
public court is for me. He was never convicted. No, nothing like that. So that is for me goes

409
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,280
against the human rights. And the second thing is that even if people do something wrong,

410
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,080
they still should have a chance for rehabilitation. Why is Jeff Marcy suddenly an exception to all

411
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:09,400
human rights? I cannot accept that. Also, I have no idea what he did in 2015.

412
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,160
I didn't know him back then. I got to know him much later. So not even commenting on

413
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:22,200
whatever happened then. For me, I care about the truth as far as people's incentives around

414
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,560
attacking the person. Okay, go after the person when they did it, if you really care about the

415
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:33,400
thing they did. But to go after it right when you publish your paper about these anomalous objects,

416
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,840
that seems to be at least motivated by the anomalous objects and trying to cover that

417
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,640
up and not like the initial grievance. I cannot answer that question. It might

418
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:51,720
have been a coincidence. But anyway, it happened at the same time. So I have no idea what to answer

419
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:59,880
on this. But I can say that I had a lot of troubles because of my collaboration with Jeff.

420
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,720
But I will work with him as long as it's productive, as long as it's fun and helps

421
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:14,600
the science. I will keep working with him. And I simply am not going to allow some peer pressure

422
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:22,520
to stop me or force me into giving up my belief into human rights. And that's something that is

423
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:28,600
important to me. Good for you. Do you think we are close to finding anything? I mean,

424
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,560
do you have like an intuitive sense for just the overall dynamic of, you know,

425
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,040
finding kind of more of a smoking gun, more evidence around UAP? I think we have to search

426
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:45,800
for more. We have to do the best we can with the scientific projects. We have to attack the data

427
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:53,800
from all directions. And we have to ignore all the setbacks. Because I think, actually,

428
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,880
one of the things that the whole bad episode with all these troubles with the cancel culture

429
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:06,840
taught me is that one has to develop resistance. One has to develop resistance on peer pressure

430
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:12,760
and critique. And I think it maybe even helped me. If I wouldn't have that experience, would I dare

431
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:20,200
to work on UFOs today? It's a question I ask myself. Or did that actually liberate me in some

432
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,720
ways that I said, okay, they're always going to complain. Some of my favorite people have been

433
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,840
unreasonably canceled. And it's weirdly freeing. Because they're just like, when you get crucified

434
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:38,840
like that, you're just like, whatever, especially when it's completely unwarranted and unreasonable,

435
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,320
you kind of like let go and just, you know, and then you're really, you're kind of free.

436
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,800
You're not bounded by like needing to be liked or validated, which most people are.

437
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:54,360
So that's, I think that happened to me. I just say, okay, I'm going to do the science I love to do.

438
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:01,080
I love to work on this topic. I don't care if anyone now thinks that I'm touching forbidden land

439
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:06,200
or that I'm saying something that I shouldn't be saying. I know some people are uncomfortable

440
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,160
with that I have the European Crash Retrieval Initiative as a hobby project in my free time.

441
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,480
What is that? The European Crash Retrieval Initiative?

442
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,920
Well, it's a private citizen driven crash retrieval team.

443
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,440
How do you go looking for crash retrieval?

444
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,560
Well, we actually are.

445
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,160
How can I get involved?

446
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:32,760
So we have a small database run by Vasco where we take in all the tips and suggestions for

447
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,120
possible crash retrievals in Europe. We only stay inside Europe because of the,

448
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,200
it's easier from a legal point of view to operate.

449
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,160
And are the databases just like crowd sourced from people saying like online,

450
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,480
I saw a thing crash and that sort of thing?

451
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,520
Yeah, we have gotten lots of suggestions for cold cases.

452
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,640
But we hope to also get some hot case where someone says,

453
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,640
hey, I saw a UFO crash yesterday. Can you come here?

454
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,200
Wow.

455
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,400
That's what we are hoping to get.

456
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,160
Do you have any recent cold cases?

457
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:13,000
We are working on a cold case that I cannot go into details on, but it's super cool. Super scary.

458
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,680
I want to go. That sounds amazing.

459
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,240
But I can't comment further on that, but there are some really interesting cases.

460
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:21,720
Yes.

461
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,040
Wow.

462
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,440
Is there a correlation with where the crashes occur? Are they around specific sites?

463
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,000
I cannot answer any questions.

464
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,560
About that?

465
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,560
I cannot comment more on.

466
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,720
Okay. Is it like, it's like a private group or?

467
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:41,160
It's a private group. So it's led by Thomas Bovinder and Alex Torell in Sweden.

468
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,400
Okay.

469
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,880
So they are the project leaders.

470
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,040
Are you guys, is there like a desire to commercialize this stuff?

471
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:55,480
We are trying to actually stay as independent as possible so that we cannot get under pressure in

472
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:03,960
any way. So far we are not funded. We are just putting our own private money into if there's

473
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,800
something fun that we find. We are looking into some interesting cases and we have something

474
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:16,680
particularly interesting right now. I cannot comment on it. I hope that we will learn more

475
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,680
in the coming year while working on that. And the idea is simply that we don't want to wait

476
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:29,960
for governments to open up about materials or UFOs. I simply believe that this is a question

477
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:38,360
everyone can work with. I believe that the only thing you need is some activity that one starts

478
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:45,000
collecting inquiring about potential UFO crashes and try to see is there anyone who is willing to

479
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:54,120
share material or willing to share knowledge of such a crash. I suspect that there must be quite

480
00:44:54,120 --> 00:45:04,120
a number of such crashes in Europe also. And not only those that one has discussed regarding United

481
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:11,560
States. So where is the information and what can we learn about all this?

482
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,880
Is the methodology like scraping the internet for like people writing about this stuff?

483
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:25,000
We are doing some active investigations of course also looking ourselves for these places but also

484
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,440
hoping that someone will just inform us about something that is new because it's sometimes

485
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:36,440
maybe easier to go to a newly crashed UFO than to try to find it 50 years after.

486
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,720
Fascinating. Do you have a hypothesis as to you know per our conversation earlier,

487
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,800
do you have a hypothesis as to what you'll find in the form of a crashed UFO?

488
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,960
Well it would be nice to find a flying saucer.

489
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,640
Do you believe most of them are flying saucers or do you think they're you know this Michael

490
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,120
Schellenberger this journalist just testified in front of congress put out this 12 page report

491
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:04,040
Immaculate Constellation this program that seemed to be some unacknowledged special access program

492
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:09,880
in the US and in it there are like there's a taxonomy. There are like different descriptions

493
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,840
of crafts. You have flying saucers, you have orbs, you have jellyfish as actually mentioned

494
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:20,120
in this document. Do you believe in kind of a variety of things or do you think the flying

495
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:25,320
saucer is the main thing or what do you think? Well my guess is that there would be a variety

496
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:31,480
of things but I first would like to get confirmed a single object before I could even speculate

497
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:37,560
further because we need the actual physical proof and I don't think any government is willing to

498
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:42,840
release that. Why do you think you know like at least not now one if I were playing devil's

499
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:50,280
advocate and acting skeptical I would say if you really have crashes going on everywhere

500
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:56,680
they're not just around military installations then like why don't we have a smoking gun yet?

501
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,400
Like if you have plenty of UFO crashes in Europe and other places in remote areas

502
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:07,960
why don't you have some like Inuit tribe or something just come upon a crashed UFO and then

503
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:13,400
like you know some anthropologist is visiting and then they see the crash or like I don't know

504
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:19,640
random explorers or travelers or whatever like not we don't have one case of like somebody you know

505
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:24,120
having like at least a larger craft Gary Nolan has in his possession because they were mailed

506
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:29,720
to Jacques Vallee and he did mass spectrometry on them these objects from an uba tuba crash in Brazil

507
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,520
and you know from from Roswell you have bits and pieces of you know possible stuff but you don't

508
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:42,680
have like the larger objects that you might expect. Well my guess is that if I'm going to

509
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:51,320
um think about a counter reply to that is that we have been so much as a society

510
00:47:52,440 --> 00:48:00,600
marinated in skepticism and we have been uh let's say if you now would see something that is metallic

511
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,560
and a flying saucer like maybe you'll think this is some waste from industrial waste that is lying

512
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:11,800
there you will find probably 1 000 ways of dismissing that and if someone would actually

513
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:17,160
say there seems to be a flying saucer in the garden you will again think that this is some

514
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,520
kind of military project and you shouldn't go to check it out not to get into trouble.

515
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:29,480
I think we have ways of rationalizing uh and coming up with counter arguments

516
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,600
so so effectively that we wouldn't be able to recognize a flying saucer if it even just lied in

517
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:41,320
front of us that's what I think that there's some sort of programming as well that has been happening

518
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:49,240
what drives you on a deeper level do you hope we do make contact and if so how do

519
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:54,120
how would the best form of that contact look like? Absolutely I really hope we make contact

520
00:48:54,120 --> 00:49:01,160
with a benign kind and nice civilization I don't know how likely this defines such a civilization

521
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:08,120
but imagine if we find out that we are in touch how much could we learn as species how much could

522
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:14,200
we learn from them what could we learn what are all the discoveries that we don't have to make

523
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:20,760
but that we could learn about from them directly I think it's it would be an amazing opportunity

524
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:27,960
for humanity to actually progress. Amen is there anything on molecular biology which you studied

525
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:34,920
before or just life in general or religion or anything that you've rethought because of your

526
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:42,520
current contemporary interest from an astronomical perspective in UAP? That's a very good question

527
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:52,360
I must say that I don't know the answer to it but I'm definitely open about the idea that

528
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,160
another civilization might have been interacting with us for thousands or

529
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:04,600
tens of thousands of years or longer and that they could have brought some influence already

530
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:13,400
into well our development I'm open for that I want to know if it's that way or not

531
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:21,160
I want clear answers I want clear answers with if there are any UFOs or flying saucers that can be

532
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:31,240
seen in astronomical data I want simple binary answers to whether they are non-human artificial

533
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:38,840
objects on the earth or in our oceans or buried underground and I want to know of course if there

534
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:47,480
is some non-human biologics that has been caught or by the humans that are by the military because

535
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:53,400
all these questions can change our understanding of our place in the universe my place in the

536
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,760
universe and I would like to get answers within our lifetime I think this is the most pressing

537
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,560
and important question I'm with you it's almost like a governor has been placed on fundamental

538
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:09,000
physics and religion our understanding of ourselves and the universe we live in and

539
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,320
that governor hopefully it will come off I have a weird feeling it will in our lifetime which is

540
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:19,160
like wild I mean maybe I'm wrong right like Stan Friedman unfortunately would have been wrong like

541
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,600
I don't think things shifted that much in the last 50 to 70 years but maybe maybe now things

542
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:31,400
are speeding up it kind of feels like they are it feels that way to me too I just want to know

543
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:38,440
and I hope that we will get a positive answer soon either through the disclosure process

544
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,600
for the political movement behind or through science if that is the case

545
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,440
I just don't know what will be the implications but I guess we will learn

546
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:57,160
we'll find out well Dr Vio Royale I appreciate you spending time with me this was really remarkable

547
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:02,680
to just learn about all the stuff you're doing how can you know is there are you looking for

548
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,240
more funding is that like something that you're always sort of open to or like what how can people

549
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:15,320
help you you know in your in your efforts well there are several ways that they can help us

550
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:21,400
one is with the exoprobe project we are always looking for more support to set up more telescopes

551
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:31,240
in New Mexico where we have our telescope I think I didn't we're in New Mexico so the exoprobe project

552
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:37,080
that I'm having now we're setting up a network of telescopes because that will allow us to

553
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:45,720
to look for such a signature from an extraterrestrial probe or non-human artifact

554
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:52,520
but also confirm it via multiple telescope and once you can see it in at least two telescopes

555
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:58,040
you can also get the distance to such an object if it's outside the atmosphere where we are looking

556
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:04,520
so we're looking outside the atmospheres with exoprobe but in order to localize it well you

557
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:10,120
need to have at least two that are well separated and of course for every additional telescope

558
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:17,560
there is a running cost coming in and also the cost of the telescope itself so this is one way

559
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:22,840
that one can be supporting us another thing that I would hope to do in Europe is that we would like

560
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:32,520
to have at some point a conference completely dedicated to non-human artifacts and how to

561
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:38,200
search for them in space in the atmosphere underwater on the ground on the ground and

562
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,880
also these are things that are difficult to organize we would where we always can

563
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:50,440
will appreciate some kind of practical support to organize it if you have a hole in Europe that

564
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:56,120
we could use for free for the audience and so on so there's lots of ways one can help

565
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:02,200
awesome well audience help Dr. Virial if you can if any of that applies to you

566
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,280
I really appreciate it was awesome I thought it was fantastic yeah

567
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:36,280
so
