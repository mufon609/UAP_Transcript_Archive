00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
The information density of your channel

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,880
is drinking from a fire hose of mind blowing facts.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,720
The Golden Age of Army R&D has a lot

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,420
of really interesting research we can parallel today

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,260
and talk about later.

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,520
But during this time, the foreign technology division

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,740
was trying to use recovered technology

8
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,600
to use human brain waves to guide ICBM missiles.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,480
Whoa.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,840
It is not only possible, it is essential.

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,940
And then there's also stories about the 1983

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,800
strategic defense initiative instituted by Ronald Reagan,

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,640
which was to act against Soviet ICBMs.

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,480
This is Star Wars.

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,160
This likely had a back door to fund UAP programs

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,320
and act offensively against UAP.

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,600
This technology is obviously not ubiquitous.

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,840
There's different types of technology.

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,920
There's different craft design.

20
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,200
One could reasonably assume then

21
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,120
there's different types of NHI.

22
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,600
Some man, some not man.

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,480
That design actually was featured

24
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,200
in the first ever episode of The X-Files,

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,920
which was allegedly based on true stories from John DeSouza.

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,120
It's the same design.

27
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,960
Wow.

28
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,480
["Different Parts of the Brain Have Different Activities"]

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,200
Different parts of the brain have different activities.

30
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,600
You know that, don't you?

31
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,080
["Different Parts of the Brain Have Different Activities"]

32
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,800
Maybe you should interview me.

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,320
I'm here with Sammy UAP Gerb,

34
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,600
who runs, I think, my favorite channel on YouTube

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,000
that covers UFOs, literally.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,160
The information density of your channel is second to none.

37
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,440
It's drinking from a fire hose of mind blowing facts.

38
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,120
I think any 15-second clip from any one of your videos

39
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,320
could beget its own entire video

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,000
on various other channels that are slower

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,760
and less fast-paced.

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,200
I'm just so impressed by you

43
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,840
and I'm grateful to call you a friend,

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,560
and I'm really excited to have this conversation.

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,720
We had another conversation,

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,440
and it looks like that might go up on my WAP,

47
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,520
this channel where we're trying to foster

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,320
really cool community engagement,

49
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,680
and have conversations that take it to the next level

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,080
when it comes to UFOs,

51
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,360
but this follow-up should get crazier

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,640
because the UFO world has gone nuts since we last spoke,

53
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,640
so it's an honor to have you here, man.

54
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,920
Yeah, thanks so much, and I'm happy to be back.

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,720
We recorded last time in November.

56
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,320
Since then, we had the hearings,

57
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
we had the Soul Foundation,

58
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,720
we had Jake coming forward.

59
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,640
We've had so much to touch on,

60
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,560
so like you and I talked about,

61
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,440
got this back together

62
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,480
because a ton of new topics to touch on,

63
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,000
old stuff to revisit, new information.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,200
It's been an exciting time.

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,680
It's been a crazy time.

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,080
I don't even know where to start.

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,240
Maybe we start with the Jake Barber story,

68
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,120
so we're in unprecedented territory

69
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,040
where we have somebody coming out,

70
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,000
a UFO whistleblower claiming firsthand knowledge,

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,840
saying that he retrieved an egg-shaped craft,

72
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,080
and then a video coming out

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,800
that may have been a little hyped up and anticlimactic,

74
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,120
but if you listen to him,

75
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,200
a lot of what he says

76
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,440
is just extremely internally consistent

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,000
with people like Michael Herrera,

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
who you've done a great piece on,

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,680
and a lot of other accounts

80
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,640
when it comes to UFOs and crash retrievals.

81
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,440
It kind of vindicates Stephen Greer as well,

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,200
and so it's kind of hard to poke holes

83
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,280
in actually just the core details of the story,

84
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,520
but yeah, what's your take

85
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,920
on this whole Jake Barber phenomena?

86
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,760
To start, the video on the NewsNation special

87
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,280
isn't even, that wasn't taken by Jake,

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,280
and I think that was rather rushed and overhyped,

89
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,640
just like you said.

90
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,160
Dr. Nolan came up beforehand,

91
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,880
said people would be very happy with this.

92
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,080
I don't think anybody was happy with that,

93
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,880
but the whole Jake story for me

94
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,440
goes back to investigating Michael Herrera.

95
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,320
Way back in the day,

96
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,480
I think this was like February of 2024,

97
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,240
I made a video on him and Jonathan Wagant,

98
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,360
and anybody unfamiliar with Jonathan Wagant,

99
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,320
he was a Lance Corporal in the Marines

100
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,680
who claimed in 1997 while stationed in Peru

101
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,200
under Operation Laser Strike

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,160
that he encountered a crashed UAP.

103
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,880
Kind of large, egg-shaped, featured some ubiquitous features

104
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,120
that we see in other retrievals.

105
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,680
Where's Operation Laser Strike?

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,000
Operation Laser Strike was an anti-narco operation in Peru,

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,960
so there were ground-based radar systems

108
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,560
from U.S. intelligence to track drug-running planes

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,400
and so forth.

110
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,220
And what year was this?

111
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,200
1997.

112
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,840
And so Jonathan Wagant, a Lance Corporal at the time,

113
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,720
basically was sent to kind of investigate a crash

114
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,080
of an unknown, possibly foreign craft,

115
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,760
and he and two other Marines,

116
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,560
one Sergeant Allen and another person,

117
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,880
found a crashed craft.

118
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,280
The story is super interesting

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,880
because it features like mother of pearl effect

120
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,400
on the skin of the craft,

121
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,800
liquid coming from the craft.

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,600
Explain what mother of pearl effect is.

123
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,360
Kind of like oil on water.

124
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,880
Something that Jake and others also kind of described,

125
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,680
unique features of the shimmering of kind of the craft skin.

126
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,640
And also, Wagant spoke of what he assumed to be bodies

127
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,640
in the craft with kind of an arm hanging out of the craft.

128
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,640
He's only ever done two interviews,

129
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,360
one in 2001 for Stephen Greer,

130
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,940
one in 2023 under, I think, Dan Willis.

131
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,400
And so he is a really interesting person.

132
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,240
Are you in touch with him?

133
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,340
Yes, yes.

134
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,200
Jonathan Wagant is one of the nicest people

135
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
I've ever met in my entire life.

136
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,240
Wow.

137
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,400
He's a really good guy.

138
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,120
Do you find him beyond reproach as a person?

139
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,240
Yes, I fully believe Jonathan Wagant's encounter.

140
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,320
Why?

141
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,840
There's small details that kind of

142
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,160
prove to aid in other research.

143
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,740
The reason I covered him and Michael together in a video,

144
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,360
besides just the fact they were Marines,

145
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,980
is they both talked about a team present.

146
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,160
Of course, in Michael's case,

147
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,640
he talked about a human-made craft that he encountered.

148
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,480
Yeah, let's back up.

149
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,200
So you're saying, so Wagant's this Peru case,

150
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,300
and then just for the audience,

151
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,500
Michael Herrera is this case in Indonesia

152
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,240
with this Marine unit, right?

153
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,320
And they see this sort of,

154
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,760
I guess he calls it Vanta Black,

155
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,160
eight-gon shape, which Jake Barber describes as well,

156
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,840
craft hovering above the treetops.

157
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,480
He kind of closes in on it,

158
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,440
and then this really elite paramilitary unit

159
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,440
then basically takes his whole unit into sort of custody

160
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,400
and kind of reprimands them.

161
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,040
And then he thinks that this whole thing

162
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,920
is part of some sort of psionic asset trafficking scheme

163
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,920
where UFO legacy programs are actually taking people

164
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,400
in third world countries like Indonesia back to the US

165
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,880
in order to summon craft.

166
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,120
I mean, the whole thing.

167
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,160
Well, initially he thought it was human trafficking.

168
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,580
And we'll get into this in a few minutes.

169
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,000
It was when he gave his testimony,

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,640
when Michael Herrera gave his testimony

171
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,260
at the 2023 Stephen Greer National Press Club show,

172
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,600
that's when Jake Barber was sitting in the audience

173
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,560
and said, I know about this, and contacted Michael.

174
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,320
We backchanneled it, that was us.

175
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,160
We backchanneled that.

176
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,000
That was you.

177
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,820
That was me.

178
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,200
Oh my God.

179
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,600
But in Michael and Jonathan's encounters,

180
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,440
so Jonathan said he saw an extraterrestrial craft

181
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,240
or a non-human intelligence craft.

182
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,420
Michael has stated, unlike the air report,

183
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,240
which lies about this, that he saw a human-made craft.

184
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,300
However, there are some similar elements in both aspects.

185
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,560
The crash recovery team in Jonathan's story,

186
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,560
some of them wore DOE lettered rain jackets,

187
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,760
and there were other seemingly military operators

188
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,800
in black fatigues.

189
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,960
They spoke with American dialect, but featured no insignia.

190
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,000
This was the same thing that Michael described.

191
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,320
Michael described a little further by stating

192
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,160
that these men, back in 2009,

193
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,040
had really advanced M4 rifles

194
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,760
with beautiful range finders.

195
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,120
They had bioscanners.

196
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,920
Yeah, kind of like what he described

197
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,200
to be like a modern cell phone,

198
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,160
to kind of scan their identification and so forth.

199
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,800
So there were some very similar elements,

200
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,080
and that's kind of why I covered

201
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,320
those two people together now.

202
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,480
And that's pretty wild, right?

203
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,000
What was it?

204
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,840
2009.

205
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,680
2009?

206
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,360
Yeah, that's pretty shortly after the iPhone was released.

207
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,780
And then, so do you have any sense

208
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,360
of what these elite paramilitary groups,

209
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,600
who they're working on behalf of?

210
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,160
Is it UFO Legacy Program, is it the Department of Energy?

211
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,240
I know that's been speculated at times.

212
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,280
I've reached, I think they're two different teams,

213
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,580
to be quite honest, because Jonathan,

214
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,580
so Jonathan described a team of guys in camouflage

215
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,020
with weapons, the black fatigue, sorry,

216
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,780
DOE rain jackets, and also men in hazmat suits.

217
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,060
So this must have been a specially designed

218
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,960
crash retrieval team to contain biologics, spillage,

219
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,060
possibly hazardous materials.

220
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,060
If you analyze other cases in history,

221
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,700
the 1974 Koyama alleged crash,

222
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,020
and some of the majestic documents,

223
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,040
there have been occasions where toxic elements

224
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,220
have seeped from crash retrievals and so forth.

225
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,220
But I think this is likely a DOE Nest team,

226
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,860
nuclear emergency search teams.

227
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,940
This is kind of almost semi-private institutions.

228
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,540
I mean, back in the day, these Nest teams,

229
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,300
which were kind of elite operators sent to

230
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,860
deal with anything that involved nuclear technology

231
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,140
or nuclear secrets.

232
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,100
This was comprised of various specialized operators

233
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,620
and also received help from contractors like EG&G.

234
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,800
We know EG&G from the Wilson Davis Memo,

235
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,740
from the story of Bob Lazar, Edgar Fouche,

236
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,660
so forth, seeped in UFO lore.

237
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,780
It seems like Michael, the team he was dealing with,

238
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,480
is the same team that Jake Barber is familiar with,

239
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,460
and this is like a deep, black, former JSOC,

240
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,220
Joint Special Operations Command, Tier One operators,

241
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,800
former Delta, SEAL Team Six, Intelligence Support Activity,

242
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,900
24th STS, and these guys are bad eggs

243
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,320
who are okay with hurting people.

244
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,100
Then this is likely strictly private teams.

245
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,700
And so who does it roll up to?

246
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,380
Because this is, I was trying to talk to Jake about this,

247
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,220
and it's like, there's an ongoing FBI investigation,

248
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,100
so he can't say much.

249
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,420
And then I did get him to say,

250
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,220
well, you could probably guess,

251
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,460
if you had two guesses on the aerospace

252
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,820
prime contractor front, like, you know.

253
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,700
Can you say anything about the companies

254
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,340
that you worked for in the context

255
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,100
of these UFO crash retrievals?

256
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,180
Look, man, if you took two guesses,

257
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,540
you'd get both of them right on the first try.

258
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,420
There you go.

259
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,620
Okay.

260
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,740
And then, so my guess is, this is me talking,

261
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,180
would be like Lockheed and Northrop,

262
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,780
but there's this other element of Department of Energy,

263
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,660
who in the government does this roll up to?

264
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,820
You hear stuff like the CIA's Director

265
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,340
of Science and Technology,

266
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,180
somebody like Glenn Gaffney would be involved,

267
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,120
and back in the day, the CIA's Office

268
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,540
of Scientific Intelligence was probably involved

269
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,940
in this sort of stuff.

270
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,020
But who's in charge from the government perspective now?

271
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,860
That's a great question,

272
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,900
and I think it's probably a very small,

273
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,900
small portion of people, I think,

274
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,420
like you talked about, elements of DOE,

275
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,740
and intelligence, CIA, and I think,

276
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,700
even more so than CIA modern day,

277
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,180
the National Security Agency, NSA.

278
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,300
We know that the CIA deals with humant,

279
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,820
or human intelligence, and we know the NSA

280
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,700
deals with SIGINT, or signals intelligence.

281
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,580
As far as why I also say the NSA,

282
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,160
so in my projects, I use as much publicly available

283
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,480
research as humanly possible.

284
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,640
I don't really like to say,

285
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,200
well, a source told me this, a source told me this,

286
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
even though there's quite a bit of people

287
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,080
I talk to that will never make it on a video,

288
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,920
or never reveal their identity public,

289
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,920
but this individual was in US Army Office of Public Affairs.

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,600
He served in the mid 2010s, and he said,

291
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,500
I'm not really afraid of the CIA,

292
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,440
but what I'm terrified of is the NSA.

293
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,620
So I think if I had to wager the elements of the NSA

294
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,280
pulling a lot of strings.

295
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,200
Well, the sort of public-facing review group,

296
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,360
the all-domain anomalies, anomalous research organization

297
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,200
or office, or I always screw it up, Aero.

298
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,640
Organization, whatever.

299
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,000
The main sort of outfit studying UFOs

300
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,560
from a public perspective, the new director

301
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,760
was a former director of the National Security

302
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,040
Administration, the NSA, John Kozlowski.

303
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,680
And so it does beg this question,

304
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
yeah, how much of this is...

305
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,240
I often think that the overrated elements of UFOs

306
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,120
are just focused on like meta materials.

307
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040
That's like the tip of the iceberg.

308
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,080
And then actually it's this way deeper sort of thing

309
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,560
around like human signal, like the fact that

310
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,520
we're like probably getting downloads and stuff.

311
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,960
And actually there's a book called Above Black

312
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,540
by a guy named Dan Sherman.

313
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,640
And he goes, he's like sort of recruited

314
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,160
into this like nondescript NSA building.

315
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,760
And I've heard some from an extremely credible source,

316
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,360
high up in government where if I were to give you

317
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,080
this person's title, it's just completely beyond reproach

318
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,920
saying that that program probably existed.

319
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,480
So he's recruited to this like NSA nondescript building

320
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,960
and basically told to do all sorts of weird

321
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,720
mind matter experiments, like collapse a sine wave.

322
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,720
He's given these like binaural beats and then like

323
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,240
basically he's used as like a sort of human antenna

324
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,040
for like alien signals.

325
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,920
And it's part of this thing he calls

326
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,820
project preserved destiny.

327
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,380
And he says that he's genetically been manipulated

328
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,800
in the womb and more and more,

329
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,880
I interviewed yesterday a psionic asset

330
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,000
who was recruited through the GATE program,

331
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,080
through these gifted student programs or whatever.

332
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,800
And so I think more and more is coming out of the woodwork

333
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,800
around like kids and gifted people

334
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,400
and like clairvoyance being approached at a very young age

335
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,960
for downloads and signals that they're getting.

336
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,440
And this guy named Andre Pujaric,

337
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,280
who I believe he wrote a book called The Sacred Mushroom.

338
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,800
And he had this space kids back in the day

339
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,440
where he'd recruit all these kids to upstate New York.

340
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,940
And he had this round table Institute in Maine.

341
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,520
And it was the space kids were meant to

342
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,960
basically get downloads from and Star Trek

343
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,480
came from one of these downloads.

344
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,800
Gene Ronberry was inspired by this woman named

345
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,920
Phyllis Schliemann, I don't know, Phyllis something.

346
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,520
And that sort of inspired all of Star Trek.

347
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,440
And EG&G, I think actually picked up

348
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,680
a lot of the work there.

349
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,160
And so super fascinating.

350
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,720
That's similar to like Tim Taylor, right?

351
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,120
He said some of the ideas for his businesses

352
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,360
came via like unknown downloads to his head.

353
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,080
Isn't that what Diana Pasolka has kind of said around him

354
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,140
and his work?

355
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,180
He engaged in protocols to basically download

356
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,060
all sorts of information.

357
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,500
And he, I believe started a biotech company

358
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,500
called Vivex Biotech and sold it for 88 million bucks

359
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,780
or something crazy like that.

360
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,900
And he claims that a lot of that was derived

361
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,820
from downloads that he got.

362
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,580
And I spoke to him for a very brief period of time

363
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,860
over the phone once he sort of disappeared on me after that.

364
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,260
And his whole thing was like, don't use your phone

365
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,860
and tap in and like, you know,

366
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,260
and it all felt like on the one hand cliche,

367
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,740
but maybe actually really fundamental important advice

368
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,740
as far as being able to gain access to better stuff

369
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,820
or whatever from, I don't know,

370
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,900
the whole thing's really trippy.

371
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,660
Well, it's been an interesting year so far, right?

372
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,820
With all kind of the mention of psionics.

373
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,200
I mean, I'm sure I speak for a lot of people

374
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,700
when I speak for myself here.

375
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,100
I don't really like to use the word nuts and bolts.

376
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,140
I think it's super cliche and overplayed,

377
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,820
but kind of my focus is in legacy program research,

378
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,780
crash retrieval, reverse engineering, stuff like that.

379
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,860
So the whole psionics territory with Jake and stuff

380
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,820
is still uncomfortable territory for me,

381
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,080
but there's still so many lines of research

382
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,180
and stuff I do that harken back to this.

383
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,260
One example is Philip J. Corso.

384
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,940
I recently did a project on Corso.

385
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,580
Corso stated that in 1960,

386
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,500
he was recruited to the US Army's

387
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,760
foreign technology division.

388
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,920
This isn't to be confused

389
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,080
with the Air Force's foreign technology division.

390
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,840
Two separate things under Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau.

391
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,360
Now, the foreign technology division,

392
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,780
there's no records of it.

393
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,460
It's similar to the Army's interplanetary phenomenon unit

394
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,040
that probably only exists through institutional record.

395
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,680
There's no record, but in Corso's testimony.

396
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,120
Which, by the way, we know that existed.

397
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,960
Correct, yeah.

398
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,680
The interplanetary phenomena unit.

399
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,840
We know that that existed, which is crazy.

400
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,560
We knew that a group named that existed between, what,

401
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,880
47 and 50 or something?

402
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,200
47 to 50, and that was first confirmed in 1986

403
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,360
to UFO researcher William Steinman.

404
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,920
In the majestic documents, there's an IPU report,

405
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,500
interplanetary phenomenon unit report,

406
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,320
and an IPU field order.

407
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,920
Two documents still disputed, but.

408
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
So those are disputed, but the Steinman thing,

409
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,780
I believe Steinman contacted somebody

410
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,480
in the federal government to gain more access,

411
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,080
and they basically said the records had been deleted.

412
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,600
Yeah, and that it only existed in institutional memory.

413
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,480
That's right, but it existed.

414
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,840
And so that's just so fascinating.

415
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,580
And I'll get back to Corso, but maybe we'll talk about

416
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,560
the IPU documents later, because that actually talks

417
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,320
about a crash retrieval that killed technicians

418
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,640
at Sandia National Labs because of the danger of the crash.

419
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,960
So Corso worked for the foreign technology division.

420
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,980
This is not in dispute.

421
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,700
You can look through his official military records

422
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,480
that said he was the chief of the foreign technology

423
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,820
division, not out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

424
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,520
But the crux of his testimony is that under Arthur Trudeau

425
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,640
in 1958 to 1962, we saw the golden age of Army R&D.

426
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,480
And this is where materials recovered

427
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,540
from the Roswell crash and possibly other crashes,

428
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,560
maybe Aztec, maybe crash at Corona,

429
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,960
Plains of St. Augustine, and so forth,

430
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,200
that the U.S. Army would partner with the U.S. industry

431
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,400
to figure out how these technologies work

432
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,640
and seed them back primarily to help the U.S. military

433
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,560
and secondly help the American people if necessary.

434
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,600
Well, we know we never saw the American people if necessary,

435
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,520
but it wasn't just to seed the technologies,

436
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,080
it was also to improve upon existing technologies.

437
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,640
You know, there's a lot of contention here

438
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,520
because some of these technologies

439
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,160
were passive night vision systems

440
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,980
and guys like Colonel John B. Alexander,

441
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,980
who has made some lies about the majestic documents

442
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,040
before dispute this and stuff like the transistor

443
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,260
and integrated circuit.

444
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,320
But I like to focus on other stuff

445
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,360
because the golden age of Army R&D

446
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,880
has a lot of really interesting research

447
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,320
we can parallel today and talk about later.

448
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,440
But Corso also states during this time

449
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,080
that the foreign technology division

450
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,320
was trying to use recovered technology

451
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,120
to use human brain waves to guide ICBM missiles

452
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,040
and ballistic missiles.

453
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,880
Whoa, really?

454
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,700
Yeah.

455
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,440
In today's world, staying informed

456
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,840
can feel like navigating a maze of headlines,

457
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,680
each with its own agenda.

458
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,000
That's why I started using Ground News,

459
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,440
a tool designed for skeptics and truth seekers

460
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,960
like many in this community.

461
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,080
It's an app and website created by a former NASA engineer

462
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,240
to tackle a problem we all face,

463
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,880
how the way we consume information

464
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,280
can distort our understanding of the world.

465
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,880
Ground News brings transparency to the news.

466
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,360
It gathers coverage from over 50,000 sources worldwide,

467
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,440
organizes stories by topic,

468
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,760
and even breaks down the bias and ownership

469
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,200
behind each perspective.

470
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,760
With features like the bias distribution bar

471
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,400
and factuality score,

472
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,520
it's easy to see how different outlets

473
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,920
frame the same story.

474
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,520
For example, when I was researching

475
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,100
those mysterious drone sightings,

476
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,800
Ground News gave me instant access to over 200 articles,

477
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,820
helping me uncover every angle,

478
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,240
from the facts to the spin.

479
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,320
For the left, from Radar Online,

480
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,360
Donald Trump says, shoot them down.

481
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,840
But on the right, news refers to it as a rogue loose nuke.

482
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,360
This just goes to show how different the framing can be

483
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,600
based on where you're reading it.

484
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,360
So if you're tired of echo chambers

485
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,840
and one-sided narratives,

486
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,880
Ground News is your ultimate tool

487
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,160
for staying informed and making better decisions.

488
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,000
You can even follow your favorite topics

489
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,640
and compare coverage to find the most credible sources.

490
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,280
And for a limited time,

491
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,880
you can get the same plan I use every day

492
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,280

and have more informed discussions

498
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,880
and hopefully chill out about those drones.

499
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,920
I only promote brands I vet

500
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,880
and I think you'll find them just as valuable as I do.

501
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,900
Ground News, the truth is out there.

502
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,960
You just need the right tools to find it.

503
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,720
Today, I wanna share something

504
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,440
that's become a game changer for me personally,

505
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,760
qualia senolytic.

506
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,940
Have you ever heard about senolytics?

507
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,160
It's a revolutionary class of ingredients

508
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,160
that researchers discovered less than a decade ago

509
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,600
and they're already being hailed

510
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,320
as one of the biggest breakthroughs

511
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,920
in promoting healthy aging.

512
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,440
This is where qualia senolytic shines.

513
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,320
As we age, our bodies accumulate

514
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,240
what scientists call senescent cells,

515
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,660
also known as zombie cells.

516
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,080
These cells just sit there,

517
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,080
hogging resources and dragging down your energy,

518
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,320
recovery, and even mental clarity.

519
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,080
Think of it like pruning a plant.

520
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,920
You've got to remove the dead leaves

521
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,640
to get the rest to thrive.

522
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,180
Since I started taking qualia senolytic,

523
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,360
I've felt a huge boost in energy and productivity.

524
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,860
I'm sharper, more focused,

525
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,400
and genuinely feel like I've rolled the clock back.

526
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
And here's the kicker,

527
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,920
you only need to take it two days a month.

528
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,320
This science-backed formula is non-GMO, vegan,

529
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,280
and designed to work synergistically

530
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,040
to help your body shed those zombie cells.

531
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,240
And with a hundred-day money-back guarantee,

532
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,840
there's zero risk in trying it out for yourself.

533
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,400
So resist aging at the cellular level

534
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
and try qualia senolytic.

Thanks so much to Qualia for sponsoring today's episode.

543
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,400
That is so interesting.

544
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,800
I didn't know he said that.

545
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,640
That's fascinating.

546
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,400
So this is, Philip J. Corso wrote this book

547
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,440
called The Day After Roswell, and he wrote it in 97?

548
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,320
97, but The Day After Roswell has a bunch of fluff

549
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,040
added by its co-writer.

550
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,320
That's interesting.

551
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,040
That's, and he wasn't super happy about that, right?

552
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,880
No, no, no.

553
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,080
Rumor has it he only had 24 hours to edit it,

554
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,400
and according to his son, he put his hand to his head

555
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,460
and said, I can't believe this.

556
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,300
That's so interesting,

557
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,640
because I was just talking to James Fox,

558
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,000
who has an interview with Philip J. Corso,

559
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,520
and we need to put this out.

560
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,360
It's not public.

561
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,200
No, it is.

562
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,020
It is.

563
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,860
Uh-oh, is it?

564
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,680
Yeah, yeah.

565
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,520
He said he's sitting on three hours,

566
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,360
and maybe part of it's,

567
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,200
Oh, okay, only 20 minutes is public.

568
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,040
I think a little bit's public.

569
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,520
It's published through Greer, weirdly enough.

570
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

571
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,520
No, so I think more can come out.

572
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,320
And he was like, basically James Fox said,

573
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,520
gun to my head, I get shot if I'm wrong.

574
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,480
I think Philip J. Corso was legit.

575
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,760
And so that's fascinating.

576
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,820
He had a co-writer that might've kind of co-opted

577
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,220
his process in some way,

578
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,000
because there is stuff in that book

579
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,760
that's, I think, clearly false.

580
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,600
Yeah.

581
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,720
Like, if you look at the tech tree

582
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,360
around integrated circuits and semiconductors,

583
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,840
I don't think you need alien intervention to describe.

584
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,360
There's, I think, a Munich-like patent on a transistor

585
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,680
that goes back to the 30s.

586
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,060
Yeah.

587
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,200
But I do think we saw this stepwise leap

588
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,040
in interesting technology around this time,

589
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,120
especially in material science.

590
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,240
And I do believe the basic Roswell story,

591
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,600
that some sort of, this memory metal,

592
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,760
and I believe Jesse Marcel, this Air Force flight surgeon,

593
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,040
that may have handled this memory metal material,

594
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,480
and that it probably did make its way

595
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
to Wright Airfield at the time,

596
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,600
which Wright Airfield would've been the place

597
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,420
you would've taken it,

598
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,560
because they were basically reverse engineering

599
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,440
adversary tech.

600
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,280
They had MIGs.

601
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,800
Russian MIGs later on, but.

602
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,520
Well, in 1943, they successfully reverse engineered

603
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,040
a German pulse jet engine.

604
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,400
So they were already successfully reverse engineering

605
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,160
adversary retrieved technology.

606
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,920
So it makes total sense that you'd take something there.

607
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,600
And then basically, to complete the loop on Philip J. Corso,

608
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,560
he says that that material is taken to Roscoe Hill,

609
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,400
or Hill and Coder.

610
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,880
Roscoe Hill and Coder is the first director of the CIA,

611
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,360
makes the call that Corso should be in charge

612
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,360
of doling this out to basically for civil side use cases,

613
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,000
for commercial purposes.

614
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,800
So like Bell Labs would be the main place.

615
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,440
Bell Labs, Sperry Rand, which went to Functon,

616
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,080
its divisions went to Northrop, Lockheed Martin,

617
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,880
Raytheon, and others.

618
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,800
And so Philip Corso actually has a manuscript.

619
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,680
It's called Dawn of a New Age.

620
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,040
And so for my research on Corso,

621
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,400
I read the two side by side

622
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,320
and went through every single difference.

623
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,280
Remarkably different.

624
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,840
For example, in Day After Roswell,

625
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,320
there's a passage about how Corso intimidated

626
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,120
a CIA director to off himself, which is absurd.

627
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,480
And of course you don't see that in the manuscript.

628
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,840
Oh, they just, they Psyoptim, man.

629
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,640
And he had 24 hours to edit it.

630
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,920
And what else, what else?

631
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,440
The first chapter of the book is like

632
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,040
a detailed description of Roswell

633
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,000
as if somebody was there.

634
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,280
Corso never, never talks about that stuff.

635
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,800
He doesn't know what happened at Roswell.

636
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,120
He just takes the materials he's seen.

637
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,400
Another example is continued mentions

638
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,440
to the majestic documents in Day After Roswell.

639
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,760
They're only passively referenced once

640
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,360
in Dawn of a New Age.

641
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,400
However, in Dawn of a New Age,

642
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,040
Corso also states interesting stuff that he found

643
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,880
after his time in the foreign technology division.

644
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,200
And maybe we'll get into that later

645
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,400
because we can circle back to the psionic stuff

646
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,320
with other like really old research we can dig into.

647
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,640
But, you know, Corso would talk about stuff

648
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,480
like a UFO working group, which there's reasons

649
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,440
to suggest maybe the Majestic 12

650
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,600
changed into that along the way.

651
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,080
But what I wanted to say about the psionics as well is,

652
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,440
and just kind of the mental phenomena,

653
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,480
I wanna route this back to three key players,

654
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,840
Dr. Eric A. Walker, Robert Sarbacher,

655
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,840
Dr. Robert Sarbacher, and Wilbert B. Smith.

656
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,480
So this story takes place around 1950.

657
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,080
Wilbert B. Smith was a Canadian radio engineer

658
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,240
who had a huge interest in flying saucers

659
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,400
after reading The Flying Saucer Conspiracy

660
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,800
by author Frank Scully.

661
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,120
Dr. Robert Sarbacher was the scientific advisor

662
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,960
to the research and development board

663
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,360
spearheaded by Vannevar Bush.

664
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,440
Around 1950, Wilbert Smith met with Robert Sarbacher

665
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,120
to talk about flying saucers

666
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,840
because the Canadian government wanted to use

667
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,040
sort of kind of magnetic,

668
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,800
the Earth's magnetic field for propulsion.

669
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,000
And he thought after reading The Flying Saucer Conspiracy,

670
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,200
there may be some sort of connection.

671
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,120
And during this meeting, Robert Sarbacher said stuff like,

672
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,000
well, in the 1950, there were meetings about flying saucers.

673
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,440
The US government studies them.

674
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,360
It's spearheaded by a group of Vannevar Bush.

675
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,640
I can't tell you what they're from or what they're made of,

676
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,440
but we know they're not made by humans.

677
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,560
So Wilbert Smith relayed that in a 1950

678
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,040
Department of Transportation Canada memo

679
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,840
that was then reduced from top secret

680
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,280
to I think restricted access or confidential in 1960 something

681
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,400
and then completely unclassified later.

682
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,960
But so Wilbert B. Smith took that

683
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,480
and met with Sarbacher and these guys again

684
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,120
to really get involved with UFOs.

685
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,840
And Sarbacher basically said,

686
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,440
I can connect you to the proper American authorities

687
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,360
to engage with more UFO research

688
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,600
if you can A, become cleared, and B, give something back.

689
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,520
And so Wilbert B. Smith, he would later on go

690
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,000
to Spearhead Project Magnet,

691
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,280
which was Canada's first UFO investigation group

692
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,360
followed up by Project Second Story.

693
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,880
But when he finally met again with the Americans,

694
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,920
he learned other things such as, you know,

695
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,160
Vannevar Bush spearhead the group.

696
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,000
He knew that.

697
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,400
He had a couple more things, but he also said

698
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,320
that the US authorities studying UFOs

699
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,160
were obsessed with the mental phenomena

700
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,720
that accompanied UFO research.

701
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,840
So later on down the line,

702
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,560
there was also a gentleman, Dr. Eric A. Walker.

703
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,760
This guy is super esteemed.

704
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,120
He was Penn State University's president,

705
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,760
one of the smartest people of the entire 20th century.

706
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,400
He was named in a conversation to William Steinman,

707
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,960
UFO researcher, that one of the attendees

708
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,080
of these meetings in the 1950s about UFO crash retrievals

709
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,560
was Dr. Eric A. Walker.

710
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,760
Dr. Eric A. Walker would stay silent for a long time.

711
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,240
He was first contacted in, I think, 1984 by William Steinman.

712
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,120
He returned William Steinman's letter really cryptically

713
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,560
with a typed thing saying like, go, go, go, leave me alone.

714
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,440
But eventually he would kind of meet with Steinman,

715
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,440
another researcher named Henry Azadahel.

716
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,520
During these meetings, he would say some interesting stuff

717
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,680
like he was present at the 1965 Kexberg UFO crash.

718
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
And yes, that he did attend these meetings,

719
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,640
but when William Steinman asked him about,

720
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,920
or maybe it was Henry Azadahel,

721
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,240
asked him about Majestic 12,

722
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,760
he said he knew about Majestic 12,

723
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,600
he'd known about them for 40 years.

724
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,320
And he retorted with a question saying,

725
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,080
what do you know about ESP, extra sensory perception,

726
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,920
unless you know about it.

727
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,760
I think he said the sixth sense specifically.

728
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you would never be let in.

729
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,400
Yes.

730
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,480
Well, it was almost, not only you'd never be let in,

731
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,560
like you can't even comprehend the reality of it.

732
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,520
It was, and I think it was a Don Quixote reference, right?

733
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,360
Yeah, chasing after windmills.

734
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,880
Chasing after windmills.

735
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,560
Which that's always stuck with me.

736
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,800
It's like disclosure isn't this file

737
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,320
that you can just give to somebody.

738
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,160
No.

739
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,000
It's like, I can't even tell you

740
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,200
because you're like, you're literally like unable

741
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,960
to cognize what I might be able to, you know, share.

742
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,920
Yeah.

743
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,040
That's, it's just so fascinating.

744
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,720
And so, and then just to add corroboration

745
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,840
to the first thing you were mentioning

746
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,920
with the Sarabacher-Wilbert-Smith connection,

747
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,280
not only did he run, you know, research and development,

748
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,760
you know, under Vannevar Bush,

749
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,280
he was head of Washington National Labs.

750
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,120
Yeah.

751
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,440
He was like atomic energy expert

752
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
at the highest level in the U.S.

753
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,520
And he was kind of scrubbed, this is Robert Sarabacher,

754
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,120
he was kind of scrubbed from the internet as well.

755
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,360
And he was known for having like an IQ of, you know,

756
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,760
200 plus or something. Brilliant person.

757
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,160
He was a brilliant guy.

758
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,040
And so he's just this fascinating character

759
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,880
who is also very close with Thomas Townsend Brown,

760
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,720
who's this anti-gravity inventor at the time.

761
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,760
You know better than anybody.

762
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,160
Well, in 1956, when Thomas Townsend Brown

763
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,680
does his experiment in Paris,

764
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,280
proving the Bifield Brown effect

765
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,280
and that this works in a vacuum,

766
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,200
and I think showing some sort of interesting coupling

767
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,240
between electromagnetism and gravity,

768
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,960
he comes back to the U.S. and he's picked up

769
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,080
in a black Cadillac by Robert Sarabacher,

770
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,800
who he's very, very close to.

771
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,720
And so there's a lot of, you know, connection there.

772
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,240
And so you had a third, so Eric Walker, Robert Sarabacher,

773
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,720
both corroboration for this sort of ESP, psionic thing.

774
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,560
What else?

775
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,120
And then another thing I'm sure many viewers will know,

776
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,120
Leonard Stringfield, who's one of the greatest

777
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,600
crash retrieval researchers,

778
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,960
probably the greatest of all time.

779
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,240
In the 70s and 80s, when nobody was doing this,

780
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,720
he was researching crash retrievals.

781
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,160
He was mainly focusing on witness testimony.

782
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,760
In his file, so in crash retrieval status reports,

783
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,360
one through seven, as well as when he passed on

784
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,040
and Michael Schrat went to his archives in Cincinnati

785
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,760
and read through the rest of his reports,

786
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,040
he found numerous mentions of witnesses

787
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,080
who had observed recovered UFOs

788
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,440
and kind of cutaway diagrams accompanying the UFOs

789
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,040
and how in certain retrieval cases,

790
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,800
there would seem to be like a headband

791
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,440
or a headband transceiver worn by the operators

792
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,040
of the craft that somehow would pilot said craft.

793
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,320
And the same thing Corso said, right?

794
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,880
In interviews with him, he said that the operators

795
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,360
of specifically the Roswell craft

796
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,680
were part of the guidance system.

797
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,640
So it doesn't seem too far-fetched when Jake talks

798
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,720
about an asset, a psionic person being able

799
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,640
to use their mind to commandeer the flight controls

800
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,480
of a craft.

801
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,600
When we look at collecting data,

802
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,720
one of the areas that we look to collect data

803
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,800
is through a psionic asset, which is an individual

804
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,080
who's trained in remote viewing,

805
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,320
psychic abilities, telekinesis, that type of thing.

806
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,200
I'm still unfamiliar with the physics

807
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,040
of really how to wrap my head around this fully,

808
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,520
but it's not out of the question to me.

809
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:51,240
It's based in a lot of research spanning back to 1960s.

810
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,920
Yeah, no, I think it's the future of physics.

811
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,960
And I think it's just, so like,

812
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,080
when you have an anomaly in physics,

813
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,920
if you can't turn it into math

814
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,600
and you can't instrumentalize it into technology,

815
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,120
I think it goes into this category called an anomaly

816
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,080
and you just don't know what to do with it.

817
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,560
And then the anomaly usually or often

818
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,360
will get vindicated in a new theory.

819
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,800
But until that anomaly gets vindicated in a new theory,

820
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,840
you just have to say it's a weird anomaly

821
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,560
and we don't know what to do with it.

822
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,920
And so parapsychology, I think is,

823
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,680
parapsychology being the psionic sort of mind matter thing

824
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,440
is proven experimentally.

825
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,520
You can't turn it into math.

826
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,440
We're in the Stone Age on it

827
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,200
and it's hard to turn into technology.

828
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,080
Maybe inside government circles

829
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,480
have turned this into technology,

830
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,400
but we haven't civil side.

831
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,320
And so I think because of that, it's totally stigmatized.

832
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,160
But if you look at other examples in the past,

833
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,600
like black body radiation in the 1860s

834
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,440
or the orbit of Mercury,

835
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,240
which was not described well in Newtonian paradigm,

836
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,160
you needed Einstein to describe it.

837
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,600
Until you get the new theory,

838
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,600
you just don't get vindication for the anomaly.

839
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,640
And so that's my take on it.

840
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,840
It's not like physics outside of that branch

841
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,320
has been productive at all in the last 70 years.

842
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,480
It's actually been extremely unproductive.

843
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,320
Well, who knows what sort of progress has been made

844
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,800
that's been kind of kept under wraps.

845
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,040
We have SRI and SAIC with the Stargate program

846
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,920
and you and I have personal experience with Randy,

847
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,840
who as a green beret was at

848
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,560
the Naval Surface Warfare Center crane,

849
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,760
went underground via contractor SAIC

850
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,560
and was shown technology that purportedly

851
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,640
responded to human consciousness.

852
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,280
We get under there, door opens,

853
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,040
we go through a security type checkpoint.

854
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,640
I remember the first thing that stood out to me

855
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,160
was that it was significantly more modern

856
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,080
than everything up top and that was odd.

857
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,280
Now anybody who's saying that the Navy

858
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,200
hasn't studied this stuff is not fully knowledgeable

859
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,040
on the subject.

860
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,960
Going back to 2011 and 2012,

861
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,000
the Navy, the ONR specifically, Office of Naval Research,

862
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,240
was publishing studies on a sixth sense within humans.

863
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,360
So the Navy, SAIC, SRI, Stargate,

864
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,160
all of these guys are pretty interested.

865
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,520
I mean, we have US Army Incom General Albert Stubblebine

866
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,080
who wanted to basically cognitively enhance soldiers.

867
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,640
The movie The Men Who Stare at Goats

868
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,440
is made after Stubblebine.

869
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,560
Yeah, after Stubblebine, Lin B. Cannon,

870
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,960
all the, yeah, the whole Stargate program

871
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,840
which ran from 1972 to 95 and systematically

872
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,080
kind of employed these psychic spies

873
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,440
which would gather intel,

874
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,200
which was hugely consequential for the United,

875
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,680
I just interviewed actually Joseph McMonigal

876
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:38,640
who figured out this novel Russian submarine,

877
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,760
I think it's 78 or 79 and that was extremely critical

878
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,280
for the US during the Cold War.

879
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,640
And he was thanked at like the highest level.

880
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,320
I think Robert Baker actually was like

881
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,720
sort of very against his intel to begin with.

882
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,400
And then he realized that it was sort of indicated

883
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,880
after McMonigal sort of figured this out.

884
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,120
And he won the Legion of Merit

885
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,960
due to the very productive activity he engaged in.

886
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,000
So I do think the Office of Naval Intelligence

887
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,200
is the oldest intelligence organization in the US.

888
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,360
It goes back to the 1890s way pre National Security Act

889
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,880
and CIA and NSA later, like pre all of that.

890
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,640
So I agree.

891
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,960
And for the audience,

892
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,800
cause they're probably drinking

893
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,960
from a fire hose of facts right now.

894
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,960
Randy Anderson is this amazing Green Beret

895
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,560
who you introduced me to,

896
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,440
who is really just a, I think a war hero.

897
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,560
I think both you and I have heard offline

898
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,280
of stories around his deployments to various countries

899
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,520
that he wants to lay low on

900
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,760
cause it's not the Green Beret way.

901
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,280
He doesn't want to brag about anything.

902
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,480
It's not the SEAL way.

903
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,160
But there's a number of people in his graduating class

904
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,040
who've died.

905
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,760
He's gone through a lot.

906
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,280
And yeah, he was stationed at,

907
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,280
he was an 18 Bravo weapon sergeant,

908
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,280
an expert on various weapons systems.

909
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,440
And he was taken underground

910
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,960
to this deep underground military base,

911
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,960
which we know exists across the country.

912
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,520
That's not a question.

913
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,360
That's not a question.

914
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,160
And that's a fascinating topic to get into as well.

915
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,560
Once you talk about Randy,

916
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,240
we can absolutely get into dumbs.

917
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,800
Well, I just want to hear you,

918
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,360
because I got a lot of flack for that video.

919
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,800
And I've spoken to his colleagues.

920
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,360
I've spoken to two of his Green Beret buddies now.

921
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,640
I have their DD-214s.

922
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,720
I know a little bit about them and their background.

923
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,960
And I know that Randy is not lying.

924
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,480
And there are people out there on the internet

925
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,640
questioning his service, which is insane.

926
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,440
And honestly shameful.

927
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,280
Yeah.

928
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,520
If there's anything substantive,

929
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,560
you have to say there or on the testimony, fine.

930
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,040
Because he also has pictures of him at Crane.

931
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,880
It's absurd.

932
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,400
At the year, right when he saw the technology as well.

933
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,680
He's a war hero.

934
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,680
You just don't, that's insane.

935
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,840
And then yeah, there are questions he has

936
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,200
about his experience.

937
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,280
The off-world technologies division,

938
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,520
like he doesn't know what that was,

939
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,640
was that non-human intelligence tech.

940
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,360
After that, we moved on down another hallway

941
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,360
and got into an area that had a marking on the wall

942
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,560
and said off-world technology.

943
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,920
Said off-world technology.

944
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,640
That, yeah, that was where the weird shit started.

945
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,320
So yeah, we go into the room and the one room,

946
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,920
these significantly higher level of technology,

947
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,800
like the lighting even looked,

948
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,480
everything was just, it was more,

949
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,160
everything was, it was just a different vibe, man.

950
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,480
I don't know how else to describe it.

951
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,600
Like I said, the lighting was different.

952
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,760
The walls had like, maybe I would assume

953
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,240
some type of Faraday material.

954
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,720
Everything was just a higher level of detail.

955
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,640
The first object was a metallic basketball-sized sphere

956
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,960
and it was above a podium and it was,

957
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,200
looked like it was just levitating above the podium.

958
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,360
Levitating above the podium.

959
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,720
What makes you think that that was non-human?

960
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,760
Well, A, I don't think it's a valid criticism as well

961
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,720
to say that because there was some sort of sign

962
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,640
that labeled off-world technologies division

963
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,760
that that's completely nonsensical.

964
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,600
Yeah.

965
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,000
I've seen that criticism leveraged around

966
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
and how do you, like, that's quite a baseless claim

967
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,000
to make that a division would not be named.

968
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,480
Sure, it may seem a bit strange,

969
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,520
but we're talking about UFO legacy programs

970
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,000
and deep underground military bases

971
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,800
that span the continental United States.

972
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,520
So that's not an accurate criticism to me,

973
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,560
but the technologies Randy saw,

974
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,360
I wanna focus specifically on the sphere

975
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,440
that he said reacted to human consciousness.

976
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,400
There is a mutual friend of ours

977
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,840
that has observed that as well.

978
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,680
Yes.

979
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,160
And that is Jordan of Sky Watchers,

980
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,920
if we can talk about that.

981
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,200
When he was involved in the GATE program as a late teen,

982
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,920
intelligence or military brass and suits

983
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,480
and eggheads brought in a case, opened it up,

984
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,520
and there was the same exact sphere.

985
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,800
That story continues to pop up.

986
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,960
It's either a sphere or a piece of metal,

987
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,280
and they wanna see, I just interviewed somebody yesterday,

988
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
and I can talk about this,

989
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,120
because it's gonna come out.

990
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,520
This guy, Shane Frakes, hold that symposium on Twitter,

991
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,640
and he talks about being shown a sphere.

992
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,480
And so it's the same thing,

993
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,240
shown a sphere and seeing how the person would react

994
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,320
and if they have some sort of psionic connection to it.

995
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,920
And it's kind of the same thing as the Jake Barber story,

996
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,760
where he locks on mentally to,

997
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,360
in this case, the Aitgon craft,

998
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,360
but there is a mental connection.

999
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,600
And so that is, and then there's SAIC,

1000
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,440
I believe is on record,

1001
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,200
studying quote unquote psychotronic technology.

1002
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,040
It's like a long history.

1003
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
They coined their own terms

1004
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,880
for like telekinesis and psychokinesis

1005
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,480
and bought up the research from SRI.

1006
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,400
So SAIC took it and ran with it.

1007
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,800
And they were operating Stargate,

1008
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,880
the psychic spy program in Palo Alto,

1009
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,840
like at the end of its existence.

1010
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,480
So yeah, there's a lot of history there

1011
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,400
that just corroborates,

1012
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,760
where if you don't know the history,

1013
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,240
you're gonna hear this Green Beret saying,

1014
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,720
I saw a sphere levitating in front of a podium

1015
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,160
and I mentally locked onto it.

1016
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,360
And you're gonna be like, that's fucking crazy.

1017
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,320
But you need to update your priors

1018
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,360
and actually dive deep into the history of this stuff,

1019
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,600
which, I mean, you're like the tip of the spear on,

1020
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,040
but I often feel like I'm out on an island

1021
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,000
where you have very few people to talk to

1022
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,360
who don't realize that this stuff actually isn't crazy.

1023
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,720
If you're engaging in solid Bayesian reasoning,

1024
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,760
maybe you have to think probabilistically

1025
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,960
and it's not 100%, this is definitely real or whatever,

1026
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,160
but your base case is that it actually is real

1027
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,880
because there's a lot of evidence around it.

1028
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,920
Yeah, and like the other testimonies we mentioned too

1029
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,040
are incredibly interesting.

1030
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,640
He and I spoke about that long before any research

1031
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,080
with Randy was ever made public.

1032
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,360
So initially when I made contact with Randy,

1033
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,320
I went around kind of looking for any other story

1034
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,520
that may involve some sort of sphere,

1035
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,400
some sort of basketball sized metal

1036
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,440
that might interact with people.

1037
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,800
And this also like almost hearkens back even

1038
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
to how we opened up with the story of Jonathan Wagan.

1039
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,760
When he got in close proximity to the crash craft he saw,

1040
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,800
whether it was the beans or the craft itself,

1041
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,880
he felt an overwhelming sense of calmness

1042
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,200
and communication in his head.

1043
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,200
And we hear that from Jake Barber as well with the eight gun.

1044
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,200
You hear it in pretty much every alien abduction account

1045
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,760
is this sort of mental telepathic connection.

1046
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,520
And I do find it interesting.

1047
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,840
Certain people are down for like breaking exotic,

1048
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,480
breaking physics in the form of exotic flight principles

1049
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,840
and like metamaterials, but for whatever reason,

1050
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,800
so that like breaks our reality there,

1051
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,480
but they're not down for the mental thing.

1052
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,560
And it's like, why is that a bridge too far?

1053
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,080
If you've crossed this bridge, this bridge is crazy.

1054
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,560
So you have to open up all possibilities at that point.

1055
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,480
And again, think probabilistically.

1056
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,600
So maybe that second bridge is slightly lower probability

1057
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,760
than the first bridge.

1058
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,360
But I think people don't realize just how limited

1059
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,440
their thinking is around a lot of this stuff.

1060
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,680
Yeah, it's like what we talked about.

1061
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,160
Like my research mainly focuses on legacy programs,

1062
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,760
but I can't discount the research done at Stargate,

1063
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,680
the psionic stuff.

1064
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,120
I can't leave that out of the equation.

1065
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,880
I still need to study it always when it arises.

1066
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,120
Of course, yeah.

1067
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,920
And sometimes those bleed over into the realms

1068
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,120
I study as well.

1069
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,960
Because we were talking about Stubblebine

1070
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,720
who was interested in psychic spies.

1071
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,480
Then on the other hand, Stubblebine also has

1072
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,600
really interesting research into like UFO crash retrieval

1073
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,640
and legacy reverse engineering programs.

1074
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,160
So on one hand, he's kind of engaging

1075
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,560
with the more psychic aspect of the phenomenon.

1076
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,000
On the other hand, he's dealing with

1077
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,800
the really tangible program level stuff.

1078
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,680
I mean, Stubblebine created the U.S. Army

1079
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,720
INSCOM Intelligence and Security Command's

1080
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,240
Special Operations Unit, the Intelligence Support Activity.

1081
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,240
And I think 2002, right around the time the CIA OGA

1082
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,720
was created, the Intelligence Support Activity,

1083
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,840
which is a really, really clandestine,

1084
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,400
secretive combat group, kind of like the CIA soldiers almost,

1085
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,880
was brought over to JSOC,

1086
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,440
the Joint Special Operations Command.

1087
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,320
And if we adhere to some excellent reporting

1088
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,880
by Chris Sharpe and others,

1089
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,240
the CIA OGA and its creation in 2002 and JSOC

1090
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,640
are utilized to perform crash retrievals and so forth.

1091
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,960
Yeah, yeah, there's a JSOC continues to come up,

1092
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,400
you know, as like they sort of go in, you know.

1093
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,840
What's the connection between Delta Force and JSOC?

1094
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,280
Delta Force is a unit in JSOC.

1095
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,480
I think it's the 24th STS out of the Air Force,

1096
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,360
SEAL Team Six out of the Navy, Delta out of Army,

1097
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,080
and ISA out of Army as well.

1098
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,320
There might be another unit or two,

1099
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,360
I don't wanna butcher that,

1100
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,320
but those are some of the primary units.

1101
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,320
And my buddy Matt Pines made the connection

1102
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,720
that Lou Elizondo is actually part of this group

1103
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,000
called Grey Fox, which is deep military intelligence,

1104
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,360
but specifically it's like going into extremely sensitive

1105
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,000
sites for JSOC.

1106
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,360
And so, you know, he might know a thing or two

1107
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:07,720
about UFOs from that, not just the ASAP, ATIP,

1108
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,480
whatever that experience was around 2007, 2012, so.

1109
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,400
Absolutely, and another interesting thing

1110
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,920
about Stubblebine, what we're talking about him,

1111
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,960
in the memoir, Dawn of a New Age, by Philip J. Corso,

1112
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,160
Corso stated he learned that in 1986,

1113
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,880
there was a group created called the UFO Working Group,

1114
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,320
which was created to study and kind of manipulate UFOs,

1115
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,480
reverse engineering, and so forth,

1116
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,320
and this was funded by the leader of US Army INSCOM,

1117
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,840
which is, of course, Albert Stubblebine.

1118
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,560
And to top things off, to make it even more interesting,

1119
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,480
so that's 1986, in 1984, Stubblebine left the US Army.

1120
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,280
He then went on to serve as like a chairman

1121
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,240
or a board member of BDM, which was a defense contractor

1122
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,880
bought up by TRW, which was then bought up

1123
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,920
by Northrop Grumman.

1124
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,600
But in 1985, Albert Stubblebine and BDM

1125
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,000
at their corporate headquarters in McLean, Virginia,

1126
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,440
created what they called the Advanced Theoretical

1127
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,760
Working Group, which was a large kind of,

1128
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,440
which was a large event classified with DOE controls

1129
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,120
to study UFO reverse engineering and crash retrieval,

1130
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,960
and we have the famous notes by Oak Shannon,

1131
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,240
which resulted from that.

1132
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,120
Oakey Shannon, who was a Los Alamos project manager

1133
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,800
very high up, you had, I believe,

1134
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,360
like Ferris Williams, Kenneth Shoulders.

1135
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,280
John B. Alexander as well.

1136
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,040
John B. Alexander, Hal Putoff, guys like that.

1137
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,400
Was Eric Davis part of this or later?

1138
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,640
I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised.

1139
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,600
He's always popping up in the same circle.

1140
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,320
Well, it was clearly this sort of working group

1141
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,720
to figure out the physics around UFOs,

1142
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,280
and I think, according to Oakey Shannon,

1143
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,600
there were some even spookier people

1144
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,760
who would never speak, and they'd just sit in the room,

1145
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,200
and they'd sort of gather intelligence on this stuff,

1146
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,400
and then when Greer started his kind of

1147
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,200
whistle-blowing efforts where he started to attract,

1148
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,960
this is Stephen Greer, Dr. Stephen Greer,

1149
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,480
started to attract all these people

1150
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,160
coming out of the government and speaking to him,

1151
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,240
and he starts to promote this sort of CE5,

1152
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,400
like getting into contact with the UFOs,

1153
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,960
attracting them, whatever.

1154
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,800
Stubblebine and John Alexander show up around him,

1155
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,320
and I believe Stubblebine offers him a big sum of money

1156
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,760
to join legacy efforts, or join the program or something,

1157
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,080
or what's the story there?

1158
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,240
So I think because of Greer's own ego,

1159
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,720
and I have my feelings about Greer,

1160
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,120
both pros and cons, he likes to frame this as,

1161
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,560
oh, Stubblebine offered me $2 billion

1162
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,400
to shut up and talk about UFOs,

1163
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,080
but I think, according to documents and emails

1164
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,920
on the DPI archive, that $2 billion,

1165
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,760
which still is an egregious sum of money,

1166
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,400
was to purchase Stephen Greer's institution, CSETI,

1167
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,840
and integrate it into Stubblebine's work.

1168
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,880
So it wasn't just to buy off Stephen Greer,

1169
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,160
it was to basically purchase his whole institution,

1170
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,640
and this was in 1992.

1171
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,480
That's crazy.

1172
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,640
So what do you think was so valuable

1173
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,840
about what Stephen Greer was doing in 1992 that would,

1174
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,680
I mean, maybe that was a fake offer, or like?

1175
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,360
I don't know if that's real,

1176
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,240
but the real meat of the Greer saga

1177
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,160
and the Greer information starts to pick up around 97.

1178
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,960
It's really hard to track down

1179
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,080
what Greer was doing in pre-1997.

1180
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,160
But he was a doctor?

1181
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,560
Yeah, he was a practicing trauma doctor,

1182
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,480
I think at an ER.

1183
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,840
I don't really know how he got interested in the subject,

1184
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,480
but he does say at the age of 18,

1185
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,400
and he said this in his 2024 September event,

1186
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,360
that he was contacted by a cosmic intelligence

1187
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,200
and told to basically save the world.

1188
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,560
He's brought a lot of exposure to the UFO world,

1189
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,800
and he should be really vindicated

1190
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,680
and he's worked his ass off,

1191
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,280
but yeah, it can be weird vibes, I think, at times.

1192
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,400
I think there was a really big shift in Greer.

1193
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,600
So he talks about his archive release, the DPI Archive,

1194
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,280
Disclosure Project Initiative Archives.

1195
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,560
He says it would take somebody two to four years

1196
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,800
to go through it, that's nonsense.

1197
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,000
I've gone through the whole thing like eight times.

1198
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,080
But so in 1997,

1199
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,280
I don't know what Greer was doing before that,

1200
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,080
but in 1997, UFO researcher Bill Hamilton,

1201
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,720
William Hamilton III, who wrote the book Cosmic Top Secret

1202
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,920
I talked about in relation to Northrop Grumman,

1203
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,160
he had been in contact with Greer,

1204
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,600
and this UFO researcher who I think

1205
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,200
is one of the most underappreciated people

1206
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,400
in the entire realm, he introduced Greer

1207
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,120
to various witnesses that would feature

1208
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,960
on the 2001 Disclosure Project National Press Club event

1209
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,120
where various government and private sector

1210
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,640
whistleblowers would speak.

1211
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,660
Some of these included some redacted names

1212
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,460
who I've come to learn about those people,

1213
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,560
they're not public.

1214
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,080
And then, Mark McCandlish and Brad Sorensen,

1215
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,720
the two primary witnesses,

1216
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,440
Brad Sorensen being the primary witness

1217
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,280
of the 1988 Northern Air Force show

1218
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,640
where an alien reproduction vehicle was shown off

1219
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,600
and Mark McCandlish, the person who created

1220
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,480
the line art drawings and so forth.

1221
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,980
And by the way, the term alien reproduction vehicle

1222
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,640
that most people associate with Greer

1223
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,380
was coined by Sorensen himself

1224
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:52,000
and relayed in Hamilton's 1992 book Cosmic Top Secret.

1225
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,540
He got this wrong, he said alien replicated vehicle,

1226
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,360
but even so.

1227
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,060
And around the same time, I talked about this

1228
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:02,060
around Northrop as well, Greer met a person named A.H.

1229
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,060
He's since spilled the name in his archive,

1230
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,000
I just won't repeat it, we'll call it A.H.

1231
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,740
But A.H. was, I guess, a former Boeing technician.

1232
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,980
And we can see from Hamilton and A.H.,

1233
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,780
most of the grounds that Greer operates on today,

1234
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,160
including naming sites where programs operated

1235
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,980
where it's Air Force Base, not really Wright-Patterson,

1236
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,500
China Lake, Dugway Proving Grounds, all of these sites.

1237
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,660
And you can see direct quotes from A.H. and Hamilton

1238
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,480
that have made their way into Greer's research,

1239
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,580
he still is used today.

1240
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,700
I mean, Greer's a big proprietor

1241
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,060
that Dugway Proving Grounds out in Utah

1242
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,660
saw a lot of UFO programs shipped over from Area 51.

1243
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:44,940
And he always quotes that 35 to 40% of programs

1244
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,460
at Area 51 were moved to Dugway in Utah.

1245
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,560
Well, if you look at A.H.'s testimony

1246
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,380
in the year 2000 recorded,

1247
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,260
he says the exact same thing.

1248
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,180
So Greer has really built upon, like most of us,

1249
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,620
like all of us, he stood on the shoulders of giants

1250
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,380
and important people before him.

1251
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:03,040
But there seemed to be a real shift

1252
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,860
when he gained that sort of popularity

1253
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:09,820
where Greer would really, really focus on the CE5 stuff

1254
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,380
which can really rub people the wrong way.

1255
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,400
And I think that's really mostly due

1256
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,500
to kind of the monetary incentive around it.

1257
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,580
Like he's doing CE5 cruises.

1258
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,820
And what is CE5 sort of summoning?

1259
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,900
It's psionic stuff.

1260
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,020
Yeah, psionic stuff, yeah.

1261
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,900
But I think a little more spiritual,

1262
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,900
like more focused on love and light.

1263
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,120
And Greer's also been busted for posting photos

1264
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,540
of like cactuses and stuff and saying they're entities.

1265
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,900
Yeah, it's this mixed bag

1266
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,420
and it's somewhat unfortunate.

1267
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,220
But you have to express your sort of gratitude to him,

1268
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,780
but then it's also like sometimes you wish

1269
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,000
it came in better form.

1270
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,980
Yeah, because I've never spoken to Greer,

1271
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,180
I've never been in contact with him, I don't plan to.

1272
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,940
But I've been bad-mouthed by him, I know that.

1273
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,480
What did he say about you?

1274
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,380
So when Greer releases DPI archive,

1275
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,580
and I went through that

1276
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,900
and looked at all the accompanying files

1277
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,100
because with each witness ID that's redacted,

1278
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,360
a lot of the time there's emails.

1279
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,020
I would look through these and I would say like,

1280
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,420
why does Greer get to talk to these people

1281
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,500
and nobody else does?

1282
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,580
So I would spend weeks tracking people down

1283
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,740
and finding out who they were and contacting them.

1284
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,340
There've been multiple that I have,

1285
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,580
but at the tail end of 2024,

1286
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,460
there was a recent entry on the archive.

1287
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,820
This was a brand new person.

1288
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,660
This was the army public affairs person

1289
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,620
that I talked about recently.

1290
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,840
I contacted this person, we struck up a relationship.

1291
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,760
This guy's an amazing person.

1292
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,060
But right when we started talking,

1293
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,820
he was suspicious of my motives, of course,

1294
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,900
because I reach out and I just said,

1295
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,180
hi, I found your name this way, this way, this way.

1296
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,660
Because whenever I reach out to somebody from the archive,

1297
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,520
I say, hey, this is where the breach of security happened.

1298
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,740
This is how I found your name.

1299
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,820
It will not be shared.

1300
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,780
I'm not interested in contacting anybody else.

1301
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,100
So this guy and I started talking

1302
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,760
and we hung up on the phone one day

1303
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,440
and he called me back 10 minutes later.

1304
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,220
He said, I need to know what you're doing.

1305
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,700
I said, excuse me?

1306
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,500
He said, I just talked to Greer

1307
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,860
and he said, you're an intelligence asset.

1308
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,220
I said, what?

1309
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,740
So apparently this guy, when we hung up off the phone,

1310
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,260
he then contacted Greer

1311
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,460
because he was still in contact with Greer.

1312
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,100
And he gave Greer my full name,

1313
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:18,180
which I would prefer if he wouldn't have done that,

1314
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,020
but that's okay.

1315
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,900
And then Greer said I wasn't an intelligence asset.

1316
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,060
So that's my one.

1317
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,100
And then he said you were not an intelligence.

1318
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:25,920
He cleared it up.

1319
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,340
Or he said you were an intelligence asset.

1320
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,420
No, Greer said I was an intelligence asset.

1321
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,660
What is he basing that off of?

1322
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,500
Nothing.

1323
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,700
He's just fucking saying that you're an intelligence.

1324
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,540
Yeah.

1325
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,540
I've never talked to the guy.

1326
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:35,820
Yeah.

1327
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,820
And for the record, on record,

1328
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,340
you'll say you don't have a security clearance.

1329
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,740
No, I don't have a security clearance.

1330
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,800
I've never been in the military.

1331
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,180
I've never been in intelligence.

1332
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,740
I graduated with a degree in engineering

1333
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,420
and I moved to Texas.

1334
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:47,260
What do you do?

1335
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,080
Do you have like a day job

1336
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,260
or is YouTube your full-time thing?

1337
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,980
Yeah, like mechanical engineering, service engineering.

1338
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,820
It's very boring.

1339
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,060
I'd like to move to this more full-time.

1340
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,980
For what, can you say?

1341
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:59,860
Medical devices, formerly renewable energy

1342
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,260
like wind turbines and such.

1343
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,700
Okay, normal dude.

1344
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,040
Yeah, normal dude.

1345
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,180
But that's been my work.

1346
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,580
But he's gonna have a massive channel

1347
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,920
and do this full-time.

1348
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,760
I hope so.

1349
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,460
I mean, there's a lot of work in this subject

1350
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,700
that I think needs to be revisited

1351
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,500
because as much as I hate to say it,

1352
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,960
and I'm sure you realize it as well,

1353
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,540
there has been elements of circular reporting

1354
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,380
in this subject.

1355
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,700
Tons, tons.

1356
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,400
And I'm sure like, you know,

1357
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,140
I've been guilty of it at times.

1358
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:30,240
Like I don't think you can thoroughly investigate

1359
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,900
all of this stuff and get,

1360
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,980
it's all so crazy and weird.

1361
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,500
You're gonna get a little bit wrong along the way.

1362
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,980
And so like, it's gonna be this dialectical process

1363
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,500
where you have to wade through the bullshit

1364
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,380
and just have open conversations.

1365
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:45,660
And I think as long as people think

1366
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,100
you're a good faith actor

1367
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,460
and you're like earnestly showing your thought process

1368
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,340
to everybody and you're like getting closer

1369
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,420
to an approximation of truth,

1370
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,960
that's all you can do.

1371
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,800
Yeah.

1372
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,260
And so, and then just saying,

1373
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,660
like admitting if you're wrong

1374
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,060
and like if somebody comes at you with something substantive,

1375
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,980
just like accepting that and incorporating it

1376
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:03,940
into your worldview.

1377
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,420
And I think the other tricky thing is like,

1378
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:10,100
people can say when you cover this topic

1379
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,260
that you are shilling a thing.

1380
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,100
And you can be-

1381
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,920
Or grifting.

1382
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,980
Or grifting, which is absurd.

1383
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,920
Like I've, I do have like a company

1384
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,420
that like encapsulates my show.

1385
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,220
I've never taken money out of the company.

1386
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,220
Like I've never like made,

1387
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,140
I mean, money has come in through like sponsors

1388
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:26,980
and that sort of thing.

1389
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,380
Cause I do want this to be sustainable.

1390
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,660
I have costs and like,

1391
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,260
I'm down to make money on it long-term.

1392
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,160
But like what I was doing before

1393
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,420
was definitely more of a clear path

1394
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:40,220
to making like a lot of money than this.

1395
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,260
If anything, I've lost a lot of money

1396
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,020
in the last couple of years.

1397
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,940
It's kind of funny.

1398
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,740
Like, but yeah, I don't think you can do anything else

1399
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,100
other than like earnestly kind of move forward

1400
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,260
and just be humble and cool.

1401
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,940
And like people sense that and-

1402
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:58,380
Yeah, I really, from what I try and do,

1403
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:01,420
I see a big gap in modern day

1404
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:04,220
in terms of investigating primarily legacy programs

1405
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,060
and witness testimony.

1406
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,900
Because historically like wherever you look,

1407
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,260
wherever you look in this subject,

1408
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,300
Greer kind of has his paws in post like 1995

1409
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,780
cause even he is entwined in stuff

1410
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,880
like the Wilson Davis memo going back that far and so forth.

1411
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,700
And guys like really great researchers today

1412
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,580
like Richard Dolan,

1413
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,500
he still focuses more on like sightings

1414
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,560
and kind of flaps and encounters and so forth.

1415
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,060
And what he does, he's almost the best at.

1416
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:29,900
Totally.

1417
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,780
Well, that's the beautiful thing about this subject

1418
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:35,100
is I don't view it as zero sum at all.

1419
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,220
I actually think you're like best in the world now

1420
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,740
and you will be like so much better there

1421
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,580
cause how old are you?

1422
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,580
You're like 28?

1423
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,420
You're 28.

1424
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:46,140
Yeah, so it's like you're like best in the world now

1425
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,820
like tracking granular like legacy activity stuff.

1426
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,580
I think I'm really good on the theory side.

1427
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,060
Like, you know, like inter-domain consilience

1428
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,860
between like science and like theory and that sort of thing.

1429
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,900
And that's what I love.

1430
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,420
And then, you know, we have a buddy, Chris Ramsey,

1431
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,580
who has his YouTube channel,

1432
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,180
to me, I think he's gonna have like

1433
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,860
the biggest YouTube channel on this

1434
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,540
just cause he's so,

1435
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,780
his like the thoughtfulness that he puts into like

1436
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,100
production and storytelling is just next level

1437
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,260
and his skill set there is so good

1438
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:19,060
that he's gonna open this topic up

1439
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:24,060
to like a whole new massive swath of people.

1440
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:28,280
And I think we're all like pretty like,

1441
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,500
I don't know, we all have egos,

1442
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,420
but we're pretty like team players.

1443
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,700
And so I love that.

1444
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,780
I think that's really cool.

1445
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,740
And it's gonna be like a new era of this stuff

1446
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:37,980
where we can just like work together

1447
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,380
and like find the truth and complement each other.

1448
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,820
It's really refreshing because any,

1449
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,260
it's really refreshing to work together

1450
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,420
because I'm sure it's like everybody who's done

1451
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,140
some research in this subject knows

1452
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,420
like any sort of disclosure

1453
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,220
is not really gonna come willingly,

1454
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:56,020
especially when it comes to UFO legacy program operations.

1455
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,060
So kind of working together and tackling cases

1456
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,740
and stuff like that is really brilliant to do.

1457
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:01,820
And Chris is a great guy.

1458
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,300
You introduced me to him at the hearings

1459
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:04,940
and the second he and I met,

1460
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,300
he and I were talking about Bob Lazar

1461
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,940
because he did the interview with Luigi

1462
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,580
from Project Gravatar.

1463
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,460
He spoke very highly of him.

1464
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,700
Luigi is super cool.

1465
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,060
I've talked to him and he's awesome.

1466
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,060
So this is this new documentary about Bob Lazar.

1467
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,220
Bob Lazar is obviously,

1468
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,660
if you've made it this far in the interview,

1469
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,060
you definitely know Bob Lazar.

1470
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:20,900
Absolutely, yeah.

1471
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,420
But he is famous for having claimed

1472
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:28,300
of reverse engineered UFOs at Area 51 S4.

1473
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,220
And one of Rogan's biggest episodes,

1474
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,680
this wild controversy,

1475
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,160
some holes in his background,

1476
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,400
but like spoken to Luigi and Chris

1477
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,680
and they've actually really helped me update

1478
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,760
my take on Bob Lazar to the point where

1479
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,200
I think he worked at Area 51 for sure.

1480
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,640
Area 51 or S4?

1481
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,680
I think he for sure worked at Area 51,

1482
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,040
probably worked at S4.

1483
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,120
And then I'm not sure that what he was shown

1484
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,680
wasn't shown to him deliberately

1485
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,280
and he wasn't given high level frameworks

1486
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,920
as sort of passage material and recruitment for legacy,

1487
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,240
which doesn't make covering his story invalid at all.

1488
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,800
It makes it almost more interesting,

1489
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,360
but to me it has to be covered through this like meta lens,

1490
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,000
if that makes any sense.

1491
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,680
Through the skepticism,

1492
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,720
but also like there's probably some real stuff.

1493
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,320
Yeah, I mean, I've historically stayed away from Bob

1494
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,400
because I'm so biased towards wanting to believe him.

1495
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,000
Growing up, I would always hear about his testimony.

1496
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,200
I was the first to buy Area 51

1497
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,360
or UFOs and flying saucers from Jeremy Corbell

1498
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,560
and his book, Dreamland.

1499
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,760
The more I study other things,

1500
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,640
the more interest I find specifically not Bob Lazar,

1501
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,240
reverse engineering the sports model, propulsion systems

1502
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,560
or reading about the files and bodies and so forth,

1503
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,440
but specifically around the facility S4,

1504
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,320
which I have good reason to believe

1505
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,360
that S4 is just southwest of Papoose Mountain Range,

1506
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,520
right by Papoose Lake is a real place.

1507
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,040
And what's your good reason to believe that?

1508
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,800
So there's a couple of public testimonies around it

1509
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,120
that I don't really wanna focus on,

1510
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:08,840
but like Dan Barish, Edward, Edgar Fouche,

1511
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,280
who claimed that S4 ran the Defense Advanced Research Center,

1512
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:17,280
the DARS, which was found in a ARPA document in the 70s

1513
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:21,000
to be proposed to exist, which was an underground facility.

1514
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,320
Never really proven to exist,

1515
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:27,440
but I've talked to one person who has been to S4,

1516
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,640
another person who said they won't comment on if it exists.

1517
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,600
The person who had been to S4 said he didn't see anything

1518
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,240
like crazy or extraterrestrial,

1519
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,440
he was just went in the facility,

1520
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,520
but he did say some things that are similar

1521
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,960
to what Bob Lazar and others would say,

1522
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,320
meaning like colored pathways

1523
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,480
to show where you can walk and stuff like that.

1524
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,120
Yeah, I think we should all wait

1525
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,480
for Luigi's documentary, Project Gravatar,

1526
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,120
because he's told me things offline

1527
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,480
that out of respect for him, I'm not gonna share,

1528
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,120
but that give me conviction that he did work at S4

1529
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:59,560
around stuff that will get corroborated in the documentary,

1530
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,960
so it's pretty cool.

1531
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,400
So yeah, I'm saying Chris has as well,

1532
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,840
and Chris is coming at this whole thing

1533
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,360
from an angle of like he's a famous magician

1534
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,000
for this, debunking other magicians,

1535
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,320
and so he comes at this whole thing

1536
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,560
through a more skeptical storytelling lens,

1537
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,160
and he thinks that there's definitely something

1538
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,880
to the Lazar story and that he worked at S4.

1539
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,240
Yeah, I mean, if that story is true,

1540
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,200
then that's one example of a deep underground military base

1541
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,120
with a hanger built into the side of a mountain,

1542
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,520
which is really interesting.

1543
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,680
Yep, because deep underground military bases,

1544
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:36,120
a lot of people associate those with conspiracies

1545
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,880
for like human trafficking or stuff like that,

1546
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,880
but those are a very real concept.

1547
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,160
There's like a very rich, rich history

1548
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,200
of deep underground military bases

1549
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,440
that started in the 1950s and 1960s

1550
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,680
out of Air Force Project RAND,

1551
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,840
which eventually became the RAND Corporation,

1552
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,200
which is a federally funded research and development center

1553
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,080
that is likely up to their eyeballs in UFO legacy programs.

1554
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,160
Why do you think, there's so many things that like

1555
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,640
when you talk, I'm like, we need to query this and this,

1556
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,760
and that's like, why is RAND so deep on this stuff?

1557
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,280
So one of the things that I talk about all the time

1558
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,880
that I think is really overlooked in legacy operations

1559
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,000
is everybody likes to talk about the government intelligence

1560
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,720
from military and contractors,

1561
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,160
Northrup, Lockheed, Battelle.

1562
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,000
The piece that's missing, the thing between them,

1563
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,520
are the federally funded research and development centers

1564
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,160
and the university-affiliated research centers.

1565
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:31,040
These are semi-private, not-for-profit institutions

1566
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,800
that are government owned.

1567
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,140
Examples of FFRDCs would be places

1568
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:38,120
like the MITRE Corporation, the RAND Corporation,

1569
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:41,640
Sandia National Labs, Lawrence Livermore.

1570
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,760
There's one at Penn State where Eric Walker was.

1571
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,240
That's a university-affiliated research center.

1572
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,120
And those are kind of another side of the same coin,

1573
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,760
and we can talk about what I think

1574
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,160
based on some good intelligence

1575
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,280
what I think these do.

1576
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,880
University-affiliated research centers

1577
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,560
are like the MIT Soldier Nanotechnology Lab.

1578
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,640
Super Soldier Program.

1579
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,280
Yeah, the University of Southern California,

1580
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,200
a creative research institute.

1581
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,920
And that's another really interesting thing

1582
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,560
where I think Bob Lazar might have done something

1583
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:08,760
in and around the MIT.

1584
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,600
He could have.

1585
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,080
Well, whenever he comes up with Rogan,

1586
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,720
Rogan always says, I'll tell you something offline

1587
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,580
where it would make the MIT records being deleted

1588
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:19,420
make sense.

1589
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,380
And then he can never say it off online.

1590
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,820
Could be a UARC.

1591
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,100
That would be my guess

1592
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:27,620
that there's probably some interesting research

1593
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,860
that he was maybe involved in that like,

1594
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:34,140
because that's from way back in the day at MIT was,

1595
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,300
Carl Compton, he was president of MIT

1596
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:41,220
who was rumored to be shown the craft at Wright Airfield

1597
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:45,740
with this sort of Anderson Trust, these like CIA guys,

1598
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:49,260
and actually like be very involved in like a CUFO efforts.

1599
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:50,940
It's fascinating.

1600
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,980
And now we have this Super Soldier Program.

1601
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:57,980
Yeah, and so with those FFRDCs and UARCs,

1602
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:00,340
what I think based on good intelligence

1603
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:03,580
is that the US military and intelligence sources

1604
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:06,340
split between the Army, Navy, and Air Force

1605
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:09,620
will have a program, whether that be technology exploitation,

1606
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,740
materials research, reverse engineering,

1607
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:14,420
or flying of alien reproduction vehicles,

1608
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:17,020
and direct connections will be made with the UARCs

1609
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,260
or FFRDCs.

1610
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,900
These will serve as the project manager

1611
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,220
performing subject matter expertise

1612
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,140
and research and development.

1613
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,180
And that will bridge the gap to the contractors,

1614
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,500
the defense corporations,

1615
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:33,020
because as far as I'm aware,

1616
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:35,100
most of the contractor personnel

1617
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,420
will not necessarily know what they're working on.

1618
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:40,300
A famous example is the infographic show whistleblower

1619
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,100
where he talks about a guy at Texas Instruments

1620
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:42,940
getting a piece of metal

1621
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,740
and not knowing what he's working on.

1622
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,860
It's the middle management of these companies

1623
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,580
at the contractors that generally know

1624
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:50,020
what they're working on,

1625
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,780
like the security directors and so forth.

1626
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:55,540
But the FFRDCs and UARCs allows kind of one step removal

1627
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,380
between the military and intelligence and the contractor.

1628
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:01,780
Well, but with MITRE Corporation and RAND,

1629
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:05,180
you would think of them as having kind of the

1630
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:08,460
top of the pyramid view on the technology.

1631
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:11,340
Like, I believe the president of RAND Corporation

1632
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,980
for many years was a guy named Michael Rich,

1633
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,100
who's Ben Rich.

1634
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:18,060
Ben Rich was the president of Skunk Works

1635
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:22,460
that says we have the power to travel the stars,

1636
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:25,420
take ET home, and made all sorts of interesting comments.

1637
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,260
Like at the end of his career,

1638
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,980
he also called UFOs unfunded opportunities,

1639
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:32,660
said that we have UFOs and they have UFOs.

1640
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,460
So like humans do, and ETs do.

1641
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,780
Said there was an international corporate board

1642
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:39,500
controlling a lot of the UFOs,

1643
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,140
and that maybe we needed to take it back

1644
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,700
into the hands of the US or something.

1645
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,100
Said all sorts of interesting stuff.

1646
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,980
His son was the president of RAND Corporation for decades.

1647
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,340
So I find that somewhat interesting as well.

1648
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:51,380
And Thomas Townsend Brown,

1649
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,940
he's doing his anti-gravity experiments.

1650
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:56,860
The RAND Corporation shows up, sees the experiments.

1651
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,780
They have this meeting.

1652
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:00,180
Something changes after the meeting.

1653
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:03,420
Townsend Brown, his experiments just fail.

1654
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,620
Something sort of nominally like they fail,

1655
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:09,780
even though clearly they hadn't failed.

1656
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,260
And then to me, it's clear there's some covert

1657
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:14,100
IP transfer that occurs,

1658
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:18,460
where his anti-gravity technology gets transferred

1659
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,940
to Northrop Grumman via his investor,

1660
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:22,620
who's a guy named Floyd Odlum,

1661
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,900
who has a majority stake in Northrop.

1662
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,380
And so there's, but there's something

1663
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,100
around the RAND Corporation there too.

1664
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,980
Absolutely, RAND, MITRE, Sandia.

1665
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,780
Sandia and Lawrence Livermore were accused by some people

1666
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:36,740
like Edgar Fouche of actually reverse engineering propulsion

1667
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:39,860
for craft that would lead to like triangular ARV.

1668
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:43,780
But you also have to look at the time

1669
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:44,780
when a lot of these were made,

1670
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,100
specifically MITRE and the Aerospace Corporation.

1671
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,780
They were founded in 1959 and 1960,

1672
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:54,260
the exact time of the golden age of Army R&D under Corso,

1673
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:57,180
who said that there were institutions also created

1674
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:00,580
to study extraterrestrial technology.

1675
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,380
And if you look at what's weird

1676
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:03,940
and what parallels to modern day

1677
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:06,140
with the UARCs and FFRDCs,

1678
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:08,700
if you look at US Army research and development,

1679
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,060
this is gonna sound so boring to so many people.

1680
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:13,180
But if you look at US Army primers

1681
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:16,140
for research and development from the 1950s and 1960s,

1682
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,420
like read through all of their proposals,

1683
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:20,380
you'll see under Trudeau when he was the chief

1684
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,900
of research and development for the Army,

1685
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,500
he proposed that the Army work

1686
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,100
for kind of technology transfer and technology study

1687
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,900
with URIs, University Research Institutes,

1688
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,780
and IRILs, I think it is like independent research

1689
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:37,540
or something independent research laboratories, similar,

1690
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:40,300
which are similar concepts to the UARCs

1691
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,020
and FFRDCs made in the 90s.

1692
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:45,060
So we see these insane parallels to modern day.

1693
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:48,580
And of course, MITRE was made out of Project SAGE,

1694
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,820
which was a Lincoln Labs giant project

1695
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,100
to like make giant radar systems

1696
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,020
to study ballistic missiles and so forth.

1697
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:58,100
Well, it's like, if you were doing any secret,

1698
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:01,220
if we live in the world where any science is classified,

1699
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:04,060
which come on, yeah, of course we,

1700
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,860
and now like it's all coming out,

1701
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:09,100
you have people like Mark Andreessen, Ben Horowitz,

1702
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,140
go to the White House, they say,

1703
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:11,740
we'll classify math and the AI,

1704
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,540
just like we classified physics and like Eric Weinstein,

1705
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:17,660
my former colleague is constantly kind of opining

1706
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,860
on like this idea of the secret science branch.

1707
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:23,140
It's, you have to be stupid to not think

1708
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,460
that some science isn't classified.

1709
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:28,500
If we live in the world where it is classified,

1710
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,660
that stuff is going on in the places

1711
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,060
where we uphold the most secrecy,

1712
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,380
which is these DOE labs.

1713
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:37,180
And so like, I don't think it's like conspiratorial.

1714
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:40,340
It's like, obviously, if you're doing a high energy,

1715
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,340
really intense physics,

1716
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:46,180
you're probably also understanding ontological truths

1717
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:48,660
that the rest of the public don't understand.

1718
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:49,900
That's often the case.

1719
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,020
Like you start to understand things about reality

1720
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:55,060
due to some of these experimental effects

1721
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:58,660
where you're breaking the bounds of our reality

1722
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:03,660
in some sense, through these high energy experiments.

1723
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,500
Like it makes sense that UFOs

1724
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,740
show up around nuclear weapons.

1725
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:09,180
It's high energy output.

1726
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:12,860
And if we live in any sort of like time bound,

1727
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,100
you know, 3D bound,

1728
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,140
like if there's anything outside of our,

1729
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:19,780
what we perceive, you would be stress testing that

1730
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:23,060
every time you set a nuke off, you just would.

1731
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,860
So it's like not that crazy.

1732
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,580
And yeah, I'm with you there.

1733
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:27,980
And I just think it's so interesting

1734
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:30,700
to try and investigate how players

1735
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,540
and the government and military

1736
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:37,700
package these concepts and these high energy experiments

1737
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,180
to classify them and keep them out of public view,

1738
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:42,700
especially when it involves kind of extraterrestrials

1739
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,060
or non-human intelligence.

1740
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:48,740
And for the aero disenjoyers out there,

1741
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,700
as recently as 2024,

1742
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,580
the new aero director, John Kozlowski,

1743
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:55,380
said that aero is working with both EU arcs and FFRDCs.

1744
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,860
So that's something to plumb onto.

1745
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,420
Yeah, he said that to,

1746
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,980
when Susan goes sitting right behind him to Gillibrand

1747
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,180
at the 2024 aero hearing.

1748
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:05,220
Whoa.

1749
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:07,340
And then of course, when Sean Kirkpatrick left aero,

1750
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,500
he ran off to Oak Ridge,

1751
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,900
which go look at the FFRDCs connections there.

1752
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:11,740
Totally.

1753
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:14,380
Yeah, I've been doing a lot of interesting

1754
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:15,460
material science there.

1755
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:16,900
It's not just a nuclear lab.

1756
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:20,220
Like they're doing a lot of frontier science at Oak Ridge.

1757
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:24,900
Many FFRDCs are owned by Battelle Memorial Labs

1758
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:27,460
or Triad National Security LLC,

1759
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,220
which one of those three is Battelle.

1760
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:30,900
Battelle's really interesting.

1761
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,260
I mean, if there's any group out there

1762
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:36,500
that is studying actual biologics, it's probably Battelle.

1763
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:39,620
They run some sort of biological materials lab

1764
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,740
out of Fort Detrick,

1765
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:44,620
and also a lot of really interesting classified work out

1766
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:46,060
at Dugway Proving Grounds.

1767
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:48,340
It's fascinating.

1768
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:50,100
Yeah, and that was always, I believe,

1769
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,820
was it the HR Cross, HC Cross?

1770
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:53,660
You know what I'm talking about?

1771
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:54,500
This memo that-

1772
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,820
Yeah, Project Stork from Battelle.

1773
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,140
Project Stork from Battelle,

1774
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,340
it's now clear and retrospective.

1775
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:02,820
I think this is a lot due to Richard Dolan's great research

1776
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:07,820
that you had this cleaving off of the vital study of UFOs.

1777
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:10,340
The public facing stuff was relegated

1778
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,420
to Project Blue Book and the Air Force,

1779
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,140
and then all the private stuff was managed

1780
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,100
by Battelle Memorial Institute,

1781
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,900
the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence,

1782
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,220
and was classified under the Atomic Energy Commission,

1783
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,540
which occurred later in 54,

1784
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:25,460
but there was a precursor called the McMahon Secrecy Act.

1785
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,180
And so it would totally make sense

1786
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,300
that Battelle would have a whole lot to do with this.

1787
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:33,980
I believe Robert Sarebacher also told Whitley Strieber.

1788
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,100
So Sarebacher, I just interviewed Whitley Strieber.

1789
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,140
He talked to Sarebacher?

1790
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:39,260
He talked to Sarebacher.

1791
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,620
Sarebacher took an interest in Strieber.

1792
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:43,100
And when he published Communion?

1793
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,620
When he published Communion.

1794
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:47,140
I'll tell you a fairly weird story here.

1795
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:49,420
Stanton gave me Sarebacher's number,

1796
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:51,500
and then he called me back and he said,

1797
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,780
Sarebacher is waiting for you to call him.

1798
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,660
He's very eager to talk to you.

1799
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,460
So I called Sarebacher.

1800
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:01,700
Sarebacher proceeds to tell me all kinds of detail

1801
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:05,820
about the materials that he was working on

1802
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:08,020
at the Battelle Memorial Institute

1803
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:13,020
about how when electron microscopes became operative,

1804
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:19,780
they understood that there was a molecular grid,

1805
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:24,660
a designed grid inside this very thin material,

1806
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,780
and that was what made it so strong.

1807
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:29,260
And I think that's probably been extrapolated out

1808
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:33,700
into our military technology in many different ways.

1809
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,060
And so you're talking about an extremely advanced scientist

1810
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,740
taking an interest in a horror novelist's

1811
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,060
abduction account.

1812
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,620
And so Sarebacher's working at the highest levels

1813
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:44,540
of American military, and he takes an interest

1814
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:47,620
in Whitley Strieber, reaches out, wants to speak to him.

1815
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:50,860
And Strieber says they're about to meet up,

1816
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:52,060
and Sarebacher dies.

1817
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,500
Oh, oh yeah.

1818
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,300
And so it's fascinating, and then again,

1819
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,820
Sarebacher's just scrubbed from the internet.

1820
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:00,700
But what Sarebacher, I think, told Strieber on the phone

1821
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:03,900
is that you had all this interesting material

1822
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,620
that Battelle Memorial Institute was managing back in the day

1823
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,300
that Sarebacher was somewhat involved with.

1824
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,420
So just another piece of corroboration for this.

1825
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:12,500
And there's research to suggest that Battelle

1826
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,540
also studied the really lightweight metals

1827
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,980
out of the 1947 Roswell crash.

1828
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,940
In 1949, alongside Project Stork,

1829
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:22,860
they started publishing information

1830
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:26,020
on shaped metal alloys, nitinol, nitmols.

1831
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,660
There was a nickel alloy or something?

1832
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:29,460
Yeah, titanium nickel alloys.

1833
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:34,060
I used to think that Battelle was phased out of operations.

1834
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,780
I'm not quite sure why I thought this.

1835
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,340
But recently, I've taken a huge interest

1836
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:39,420
in Battelle being one of the primary contractors out

1837
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:41,500
at Dugway Proving Grounds, which I think

1838
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,500
has a massive underground facility.

1839
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:48,180
I've talked to a witness who didn't go on the 2023 career

1840
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,620
NPC, but I've talked to him and I've interviewed him.

1841
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:53,660
And he, while working as a contractor for the C. Martin

1842
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:56,060
Company at Dugway at the West Desert Test Wing

1843
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:58,140
in the Avery section, stumbled upon a building

1844
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:02,420
where he saw a craft hovering in the air being tested on.

1845
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,540
So fascinating.

1846
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,580
And then Battelle runs.

1847
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,660
Battelle has a bunch of old contracts

1848
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:12,140
for making enclosed laboratories at Dugway and stuff.

1849
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,860
That is really fascinating.

1850
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:16,700
Is there a Mormon connection with Dugway?

1851
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,700
Because it's in Utah.

1852
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:22,900
And I think of the CIA as being fed into by a lot of Mormons.

1853
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,780
Mormons were surrounding sort of Howard Hughes.

1854
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:27,900
Well, Greer likes to say so, right?

1855
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:28,700
But I don't know.

1856
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,420
I haven't been able to make that connection.

1857
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:33,740
But I was able to make a Dugway Proving Ground connection

1858
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:36,460
to one of your recent videos with James Fox.

1859
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:37,380
Oh, tell me.

1860
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,460
So I was rewatching your James Fox interview,

1861
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:43,740
and he talks about the 1971 Holloman Air Force base

1862
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:47,620
footage that he talked to filmmaker Alan Sandler, who

1863
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,780
said he saw the footage and saw beans in the footage.

1864
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,220
Yeah, we showed that conversation

1865
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:52,820
between him and Sandler.

1866
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,780
What did you see on the film?

1867
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:55,380
Was it color?

1868
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:56,420
Was it black and white?

1869
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:57,500
It was black and white.

1870
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,420
It was black and white.

1871
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,660
When I saw it, it would be a black and white friend.

1872
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:03,780
But it was nothing other than what we said in the book.

1873
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:06,300
We see this thing, this round thing.

1874
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,340
And it wasn't that stable, funny part.

1875
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,740
And it landed, and the door opened,

1876
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:14,580
and guys come out looking like they were outer space guys.

1877
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:19,820
So in 1971, Sandler and another filmmaker, Robert Emanager,

1878
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,700
or something like that, I think his name was.

1879
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:22,300
Emanager, yeah.

1880
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:27,140
Yeah, they were approached by two US military officials

1881
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,500
to make a documentary, and they could include the Holloman Air

1882
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,740
Force base footage.

1883
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:34,860
One of these individuals was an Army or Air Force,

1884
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:38,340
I can't remember, a colonel named Weinbrenner.

1885
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,660
And Weinbrenner was actually part of the Foreign Technology

1886
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,500
Division out of Wright-Patt for a while.

1887
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,500
So that occurred in the 80s or the late 70s.

1888
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,060
And so time goes on.

1889
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:49,300
Weinbrenner would be asked all the time about UFOs,

1890
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,780
because Robert Emanager would go back and ask him,

1891
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:52,740
what did you think?

1892
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:55,140
And there's a story of a conversation where he

1893
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:56,460
and Weinbrenner are speaking.

1894
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,660
And Weinbrenner is saying, oh, UFOs don't exist,

1895
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,580
blah, blah, blah, while taking a book off his shelf

1896
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,980
and giving him a book about UFOs.

1897
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,940
But on his deathbed, there's a lot of research

1898
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:07,260
proposed by like Grant Cameron and Anthony Bregalia

1899
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:10,180
and so forth about Weinbrenner on his deathbed

1900
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:13,420
saying that they house dead extraterrestrials at a facility

1901
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:15,780
out in Utah, which, of course, is Dugway Proving Grounds.

1902
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:17,340
Oof, it's really crazy.

1903
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:18,700
I made that connection last night.

1904
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:22,460
It was fun to see, the Sandler to Weinbrenner to Dugway.

1905
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:26,220
Sammy, are you in touch with any UFO whistleblowers,

1906
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:28,300
not whistleblowers yet, people on the inside,

1907
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:31,180
who have firsthand witnessed crafts?

1908
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:32,340
Absolutely, yeah.

1909
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:35,740
And anybody who has witnessed craft in a hangar

1910
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:38,220
in a classified facility in the US,

1911
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:40,180
not just seeing a thing flying in the air.

1912
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:41,300
Yeah.

1913
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,380
That's wild, man.

1914
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:44,540
Yeah, but will they talk publicly?

1915
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,540
No.

1916
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:48,300
And will they discuss the full extent?

1917
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,820
Why won't they talk publicly?

1918
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:52,940
I do think it's important context for the audience.

1919
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:55,900
We're going to get comments, trust me, bro, or whatever.

1920
01:15:55,900 --> 01:16:01,140
No, no, I'm not saying that to push a narrative or say,

1921
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:01,900
run with this.

1922
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:03,740
I know people have seen this, not a trust me, bro thing.

1923
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:05,780
But yeah, of course, I've talked to people

1924
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:08,940
I take very seriously, like good friends that I've made

1925
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:09,780
who have said this.

1926
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:13,780
And these people are former military or intelligence.

1927
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:15,380
They're not contractors.

1928
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:17,500
I haven't heard a peep from a contractor.

1929
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,660
I think that's a whole nother story

1930
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:22,780
because there's government NDAs and contractor NDAs

1931
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:24,620
and the penalties for violating those are severe.

1932
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:29,460
But these military people are bound by NDAs sometimes,

1933
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,420
which usually really long NDAs,

1934
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,900
like decades long or lifelong agreements.

1935
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,140
And they do not want to be the person to violate this.

1936
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,180
Any who've seen bodies?

1937
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:40,420
One of them has talked about a place

1938
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:41,620
in which bodies are stored.

1939
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:43,660
Where they're stored.

1940
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:47,380
We'll say that because that might lead to people

1941
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:49,300
being able to identify that person.

1942
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1943
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,540
Anything about the bodies and what they look like?

1944
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:55,260
No, nothing about the bodies because I think that is privy

1945
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:58,900
to a lot of their NDAs and so forth.

1946
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,940
So they can't talk about that.

1947
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:04,380
How do you think this stuff gets so well-hitted?

1948
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:06,860
I think there are some really important

1949
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:09,700
foundational questions that the Jake Barber story brings up,

1950
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:13,060
which is if you can summon these things on command,

1951
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:15,580
then you probably have a thousand plus.

1952
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:16,820
And if you have a thousand plus,

1953
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:18,500
then you'd expect more leakage.

1954
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,420
You'd expect more like I saw the thing in the hangar

1955
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:22,260
and I wasn't supposed to.

1956
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:24,460
I took a photo and it's out.

1957
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:26,340
You hear rumors on the other side of this

1958
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:28,500
that we have 10 to 15 and they're like,

1959
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,460
we can only select things.

1960
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,820
It's around atomic sites or whatever.

1961
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:32,980
How many do we have?

1962
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,620
10 to 15 and a thousand plus.

1963
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:36,380
That's a wide range.

1964
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:39,380
And so clearly we can't fully attract these things

1965
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:40,820
that will would be my guess

1966
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:42,940
because I think if we had a thousand plus,

1967
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:43,900
these things would have leaked.

1968
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,900
So do you have kind of like a mental model on that?

1969
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,100
That's a good question because if we look at Ryan S. Wood's

1970
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,660
Fantastic with Magic Eyes only,

1971
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:54,100
we can find over a hundred cases of UFO crash retrieval.

1972
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,100
And even if only 20% of those are true,

1973
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,220
that's still above 20.

1974
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,340
There's also claims by Greer and others

1975
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:02,660
that at some of these black sites,

1976
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:05,020
one to two craft are brought down a year.

1977
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:08,860
So I have no conceivable notion

1978
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:10,900
of how many craft have been brought down

1979
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,020
or why they're brought down.

1980
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,900
You know, you got guys like Philip J. Corso

1981
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,940
who talk about the initial Roswell crash

1982
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:18,940
being due to kind of conflicting radio signatures,

1983
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:21,080
messing with craft navigation.

1984
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,780
You have testimonies like the 1953 Kingman, Arizona crash

1985
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,200
where possibly nuclear testing

1986
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,160
from Operation Upshot Knothole messed with craft.

1987
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,800
And then you have Barbara's testimony

1988
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,180
that psionic abilities can forcefully land craft

1989
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:35,520
or bring them down,

1990
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,880
or they have EM weapons to target the craft

1991
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:38,700
and bring them down.

1992
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:39,960
And then there's also stories about

1993
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,280
the 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative

1994
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,720
instituted by Ronald Reagan,

1995
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,360
which was to act against Soviet ICDs.

1996
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,240
This is Star Wars.

1997
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,940
Yeah, this is the Star Wars programs.

1998
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:48,920
I've talked to numerous people

1999
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,800
and I talk about this all the time in my projects

2000
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,200
that this likely had a back door to both fund UAP programs

2001
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,720
and act offensively against UAP.

2002
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,640
So there seems to be numerous methods

2003
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,660
for them to crash accidentally or be brought down forcefully.

2004
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:03,480
How often is that successful?

2005
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,320
I have no idea.

2006
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,300
And what sort of technology is being brought down?

2007
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,280
In Jake's case, we have the testimony

2008
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,560
of the egg and the eight gone.

2009
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,520
And there's also the classic saucer and so forth.

2010
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:16,400
And this technology is obviously not ubiquitous.

2011
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,320
There's different types of technology.

2012
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,420
There's different craft design.

2013
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,040
One could reasonably assume then

2014
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,560
there's different types of NHI.

2015
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,120
Some manned, some not manned.

2016
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,960
I often think back to the 2008.

2017
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,360
I'll say this slow,

2018
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,120
because it's of course very complicated.

2019
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:35,080
But the 2008 contractor that rhymes with Bakkeed Barton

2020
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:38,920
wanting to divest themselves of a craft to-

2021
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:40,120
You could say this.

2022
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,960
David Grush said this on Joe Rogan.

2023
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:42,840
Oh, okay, okay.

2024
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:46,080
So in 2008, when Lockheed wanted to get rid of materials

2025
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:50,440
to the OSOT program through the CIA office,

2026
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,720
the Directorate of Science and Technology, Glenn Gaffney.

2027
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,040
And he blocked that.

2028
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,120
Correct, he blocked that, stopped that from happening.

2029
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:00,080
And I have really good reason to believe

2030
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,680
that this was materials for the craft

2031
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:05,200
from the 1953 Kingman crash.

2032
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,280
And there's also other lines of research-

2033
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,600
I believe that too, by the way.

2034
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2035
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,720
And there's other lines of research to suggest

2036
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,520
that Lockheed, the only reason they were able

2037
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:17,460
to give this up is because they were completely comfortable

2038
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:20,200
in the fact that no other contractor,

2039
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,600
no other foreign government or no US government

2040
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,000
could make any heads or tails of this technology.

2041
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
And that stands at a huge juxtaposition

2042
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,880
from all the other stories of alien reproduction

2043
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,880
vehicles being created.

2044
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,480
Yeah, so where are you there?

2045
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,480
Because I think this is really important,

2046
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,120
is how much have we actually reverse engineered,

2047
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,520
made progress and made these things flyable?

2048
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,660
And you've gone really deep on this interesting story

2049
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:43,480
of Mark McCandless, Brad Sorensen.

2050
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,800
But I'd love to hear, let's go over that story

2051
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,400
and then I also just want to kind of zoom out

2052
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,920
and get your view on like,

2053
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,600
have we reverse engineered UFOs effectively?

2054
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:57,600
Okay, so Brad Sorensen, he's an industrial designer

2055
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,160
with his friend, aerospace illustrator,

2056
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,720
who had worked for defense contractors,

2057
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,320
popular science, Mark McCandless,

2058
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:07,400
in either October to December of 1980.

2059
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,200
Yeah, so McCandless is a top aviation illustrator,

2060
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,240
worked with the biggest contractors,

2061
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,320
and you hear him speak and like,

2062
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,880
the guy doesn't seem like a liar to me.

2063
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:17,840
He was a genius.

2064
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,720
He was super smart and like,

2065
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,880
just almost like slightly, I don't want to say autistic,

2066
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:27,320
but like, you just hear him speak and he oozes authenticity.

2067
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,660
Yeah, yeah.

2068
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:31,700
So Mark and Brad are to go to an air show

2069
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,780
at Norton Air Force Base in 1988.

2070
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:38,640
Mark had to not go to do work for Popular Mechanics.

2071
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:40,920
We can actually see the cover of that magazine

2072
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:41,760
he worked on.

2073
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,920
So Brad goes with some former high up official,

2074
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:45,960
I initially at the time thought

2075
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,280
it might have been Frank Carlucci,

2076
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,200
but it might have been somebody else he went with.

2077
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,320
The air shows going on,

2078
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,120
there's all types of interesting stuff,

2079
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,520
fighters, advanced technologies, and so forth,

2080
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,040
and then the person Brad is with brings him

2081
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,840
to a classified exhibit at another hangar

2082
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,640
and passes Brad off as his aide.

2083
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,500
This was a former like, secretary of defense

2084
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,240
or really high up person,

2085
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,320
and there were other senators there,

2086
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:14,160
Georgie Brown Jr., Cranston, and so forth.

2087
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,160
Mark kind of thought this might have been flown down

2088
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,960
to Air Force Plant 42 a couple miles away,

2089
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,300
but after further research and talking to some people,

2090
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,600
I do think this event did occur at Norton.

2091
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,360
So Brad Sorensen is brought into a hangar

2092
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,900
where all sorts of advanced aerospace vehicles

2093
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:29,740
are shown off.

2094
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:31,240
So this is like a back of the house,

2095
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,960
more secret version of the air show,

2096
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,640
only for select people.

2097
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,200
And so there's like a hovercraft,

2098
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,440
there's the losing competitor

2099
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,560
to the B2 Spirit bomber race.

2100
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,780
There's a craft called the Pulsar,

2101
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:45,020
which is likely a Lockheed Northrop group craft.

2102
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:48,980
It's an unmanned UAV, unmanned aerial vehicle.

2103
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:51,820
And it was designed to go at incredible speeds

2104
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:54,100
with scramjet technology to go super fast.

2105
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:56,500
That could deploy like 120 nuclear warheads

2106
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:57,580
on its underbelly.

2107
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:59,160
Insane piece of technology.

2108
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:04,160
And this whole giant hangar is separated by black curtain.

2109
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,320
So eventually they go to the other side of the black curtain

2110
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,180
and that's where mama baby and papa bear are.

2111
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,820
These are three flying saucers hovering off the ground.

2112
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:15,520
Identical in composition, but scaled to different sizes.

2113
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:19,260
What stood out to me from...

2114
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,100
So-

2115
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,380
And these look like acorn shaped, is that right?

2116
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,140
Yeah, it looks like a jello mold

2117
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:25,740
with half a ping pong ball at the top.

2118
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:26,580
Yep.

2119
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:28,620
And so sort of a typical saucer shape

2120
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:31,620
or maybe what you would see in the Kexberg crash of 1965.

2121
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:32,460
Almost.

2122
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:33,580
It's like a dome on top.

2123
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:35,340
Yeah, like a dome on top.

2124
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:37,340
And I wanna pause here for a second

2125
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:38,740
because historically people have said

2126
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:41,180
that Mark McCandless has relayed this story secondhand,

2127
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:43,520
which he has because he created line art of the craft,

2128
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,740
which we'll go into in a second.

2129
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:48,460
But this was not supposed to be published, what I found.

2130
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:50,740
And I was told it wasn't supposed to be published

2131
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:53,500
by a person, but I found an original interview

2132
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,640
from I think 1990 with Brad Sorensen and Bill Scott

2133
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,100
of Aviation Week and Space Technology.

2134
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,320
So no longer is this a secondhand retelling.

2135
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,460
No, this is straight from Brad Sorensen, okay?

2136
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:06,040
This is not a secondhand encounter.

2137
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,500
This is straight from Brad, who by the way,

2138
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,700
gave me death threats.

2139
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,500
I don't like Brad, not a nice guy.

2140
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:13,980
Yeah, he sent you some pretty weird shots across the bow

2141
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:16,660
and said something about, so Mark McCandless died

2142
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,440
a sort of strange death.

2143
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,100
And he said something like I couldn't protect him anymore

2144
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:24,020
or something, and then I believe the filmmaker

2145
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:26,620
who made this documentary, I forget what the name

2146
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,340
of the documentary is on Mark McCandless,

2147
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:31,780
which is called Zero Point, something about Zero Point.

2148
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:32,980
It's not the hunt for Zero Point,

2149
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:33,820
but something about-

2150
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,640
Zero Point is like the story of Mark McCandless.

2151
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,460
That's right, something like that.

2152
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:40,140
I think James Allen, he died in a weird way.

2153
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:42,420
In his autopsy report, it showed evidence

2154
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:43,500
of heavy metal poisoning.

2155
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,500
Right.

2156
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,740
I've actually talked to the editor of that interview since

2157
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:49,340
and he said that they had received kind of threats

2158
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:52,620
like men in black type encounters and so forth.

2159
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,580
So somebody did not want this out.

2160
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:55,420
Yeah.

2161
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:57,580
And so, okay, Brad Sorensen actually has a firsthand

2162
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:00,220
interview with Bill Scott of Aviation Week.

2163
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,180
Goes back to the early 90s.

2164
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,220
What is he, when was it?

2165
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:04,060
1990.

2166
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:04,880
Was it 1990?

2167
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:05,720
Yeah.

2168
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:06,560
So what does he say?

2169
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,700
So he said he saw these three craft.

2170
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:10,660
There was a demonstration by like cats in suits

2171
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:14,260
with kind of a VCR and a video showing the craft

2172
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:16,420
over a dry lake bed, hopping, hopping, hopping,

2173
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:18,140
shooting up into the air.

2174
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:20,540
And there were some panels pulled off of the craft

2175
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:22,500
and essentially the bottom portion had

2176
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,000
what looked like a giant Tesla coil almost,

2177
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,680
like copper plates and a rotary arm to reach out.

2178
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:31,940
The top part looked like a removable crew cabin.

2179
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:34,620
This had F4 Phantom jump seats, super crap,

2180
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:38,980
like a handball control mechanism, which by the way,

2181
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:41,100
that was the control mechanism for the Triangular Craft

2182
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,940
and Secret Machines by Tom DeLong.

2183
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:44,860
But that's a whole other story.

2184
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:48,620
And the thing looked like, all three looked like crap.

2185
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:50,940
Sorensen said that it looked like it was made

2186
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:53,400
by scientists, not engineers.

2187
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,740
There was no beauty in design.

2188
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:58,180
There was no streamlining of features.

2189
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:00,100
There was slag on it, chips.

2190
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,440
These things looked like they had beaten up.

2191
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,460
There were rivets on the outside.

2192
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:06,260
And so eventually during, the pitch for this

2193
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:09,540
was to garner funding because Reagan had put a lot of effort

2194
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:12,660
into this project with Star Wars and so forth

2195
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:15,380
and the incoming administration, they wanted to see

2196
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:18,940
just as much advanced aerospace money put in.

2197
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:22,420
And so the story behind this by the men in charge

2198
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:25,500
was that these craft were created, were copied

2199
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:28,600
from technology found in a crash in 47.

2200
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,440
The technology was not given to us.

2201
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,580
It was forcibly taken.

2202
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,740
It was never meant to be had.

2203
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:36,420
The people who it was taken from or the things

2204
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:39,220
that it was taken from, it was taken forcefully.

2205
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:42,760
And that this was our poor man's interpretation

2206
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:45,100
of how this technology worked.

2207
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:47,180
So interesting, because yeah, that's the rumor

2208
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:49,220
about Roswell, it was high powered radar

2209
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:52,540
that we sort of, you know, that messed with,

2210
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,900
interfered with the flight patterns of these UFOs

2211
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,440
and then they come down and we weren't meant

2212
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,540
to have this stuff.

2213
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:01,160
And then you hear rumors in and around legacy programs

2214
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:05,560
of like whatever beings are in control of the UFOs

2215
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:08,360
like want their stuff back and are extremely angry

2216
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,240
at the legacy UFO programs.

2217
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,560
And so that begets all sorts of weird ontological

2218
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:16,060
questions there, but I wanna stick with the core details.

2219
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:19,720
So what else gives you conviction that this is true

2220
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:23,560
and that we do have flyable UFOs because I just think,

2221
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,560
you know, so many people are gonna sort of be skeptical.

2222
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:26,400
Right.

2223
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,300
I completely understand.

2224
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,840
It's such a crazy topic, but this was the birthplace

2225
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,160
of what we'll call ARV, alien reproduction vehicle.

2226
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:35,520
This was kind of the first ever big testimony of it.

2227
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,400
And Mark McCandless, before he passed in 2020

2228
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,320
due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound that, you know,

2229
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:45,280
who knows, he investigated the flux liner,

2230
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,060
what it was called ARV multiple times.

2231
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:49,360
He talked to an individual named Kent Sellen,

2232
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,760
who said he saw this over Edwards Air Force Base

2233
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:52,920
in the 70s.

2234
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:56,760
He has an image taken by a pilot Harvey something,

2235
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,820
I can't quite remember, over Provo, Utah,

2236
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:01,500
right by Dugway Proving Grounds in the 60s.

2237
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:04,460
And that looks identical down to the synthetic vision system

2238
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:07,100
on the outside, which was an array of cameras

2239
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:09,300
to kind of point to a location and-

2240
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:10,640
That's what's so interesting about this.

2241
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:14,420
It's as if we were given this sort of intact shell

2242
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:18,240
and then we retroactively patchworked on like,

2243
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,220
kind of low tech.

2244
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:20,380
Yeah, like the jump seats.

2245
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:22,700
The jump seats and the cameras,

2246
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,520
and then you kind of like make this thing work,

2247
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,260
but like it's this really low tech combined

2248
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:31,220
with the really high tech that we were given or something.

2249
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:32,900
But this isn't the only example.

2250
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,380
You know, there's the controversial account

2251
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,780
of Edgar Fouche.

2252
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:38,020
A lot of people like to discount,

2253
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:40,380
especially because they like to say that Fouche

2254
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:43,160
has been debunked due to a lot of controversy

2255
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,940
with the alien scientist that I still think

2256
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:46,340
is it's really worth revisiting.

2257
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:47,300
I talked about it a little bit,

2258
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:48,140
but-

2259
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:49,900
The alien scientist is a YouTuber named Jeremy Reece.

2260
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:52,140
Yeah, yeah, and he had a relationship with Fouche.

2261
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:53,100
Okay, oh, interesting.

2262
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:53,940
I've talked to the guy.

2263
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:54,760
He's a nice guy.

2264
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:55,600
Yeah, yeah, he's cool.

2265
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:58,000
But he's pretty critical of Fouche.

2266
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,880
So what's up with Edgar Fouche and-

2267
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,240
So Fouche was a USAAF master sergeant

2268
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,520
that actually has-

2269
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,840
USAAF is United States Air Force, yeah.

2270
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,920
He has verifiable work at Area 51 in the 70s.

2271
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:10,760
Okay.

2272
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,280
And he said whilst at Area 51,

2273
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,440
he would work on like advanced satellite uplinks

2274
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:17,120
and so forth, but he would come to learn

2275
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,320
from various friends he knew,

2276
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:23,060
including some NSA officials of the TR-3B,

2277
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:25,000
reverse engineered flying triangle.

2278
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:25,840
Yep.

2279
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,320
Weirdly enough, I've talked to a guy,

2280
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,160
former Army in the mid 2010s,

2281
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,800
who said he saw a triangle craft

2282
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,960
jut off of an airway in Area 51.

2283
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,040
That's pretty interesting.

2284
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,320
Well, we can say this now,

2285
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,840
because I said this in my piece with Randy Anderson.

2286
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:43,600
Randy Anderson, who you introduced me to,

2287
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,120
this Green Beret, amazing guy,

2288
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,500
who claimed to be taken to this

2289
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,720
off-world technologies division,

2290
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,400
Naval Surface Warfare crane,

2291
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,280
also occasionally does contractor work at Area 51,

2292
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,500
and he's told both of us now,

2293
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:56,980
and I've said this publicly,

2294
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:59,540
that he has seen triangle craft

2295
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:04,100
that he can only presume uses electrogravitic propulsion

2296
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,900
because it's not using normal flight principles,

2297
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:10,100
at least observably to him, take off at Area 51.

2298
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:10,940
Yeah.

2299
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,860
Well, this is even a separate guy too.

2300
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:14,220
Okay, so then you have another guy.

2301
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:15,060
Yeah.

2302
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:15,880
Okay.

2303
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,640
Yeah, he said that this took off during a,

2304
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:19,900
in the Chao Hall at A51,

2305
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:23,320
during classified takeoffs of aircraft,

2306
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,500
the windows are supposed to be lowered,

2307
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:25,340
and nobody looks outside,

2308
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:27,180
but because he was with a colonel,

2309
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:28,240
they just kind of looked outside,

2310
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,480
and a craft took up,

2311
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,180
it didn't disturb any of the dust around it,

2312
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:34,140
shot up silently, just vertically straight up.

2313
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:34,980
And this is-

2314
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:35,900
There's so many stories about this,

2315
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,580
even Paul Benowitz,

2316
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:40,180
who was totally mentally screwed up with,

2317
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:41,740
and PsiOpt by Rick Doty,

2318
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:43,540
Air Force Officer Special Investigations,

2319
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:45,620
and Project Beta's great book by Greg Bishop

2320
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:46,920
documents all of this.

2321
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:49,860
You know, like, even,

2322
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:52,220
like the reason that he got onto the radar

2323
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:54,620
of all these kind of like counter-intel people

2324
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:56,500
was because he saw this craft,

2325
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,580
you know, vertically taking off

2326
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:59,020
and landing at Kirtland Air Force Base

2327
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:01,380
that looked to be like it was employing

2328
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,900
exotic flight principles.

2329
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:03,740
Right.

2330
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:04,900
And we know from William Steinman,

2331
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:07,120
this great researcher, UFO researcher,

2332
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,660
that this guy, Eric Henry Wang,

2333
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:12,000
who ran special projects at Wright-Patterson,

2334
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,380
or Wright Airfield at the time,

2335
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,480
was taken to Kirtland Air Force Base

2336
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:18,140
to work probably on some of this exotic flight stuff.

2337
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,540
Yeah, and Wang was also talked about

2338
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:22,260
by my primary Kingman witness, Arthur Stancel Jr.

2339
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:23,900
Yep.

2340
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:25,100
So that's funny too,

2341
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,500
but this craft, the TR-3B,

2342
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,640
there were allegedly multiple versions,

2343
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:31,220
a prototype and operational version

2344
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:35,420
ranging from 200 to 600 feet in diameter,

2345
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:38,580
crewing four, serving as logistics and transportation

2346
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:41,260
for what could only be known as a secret space fleet.

2347
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:43,180
The propulsion device for the system

2348
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:45,820
was reverse engineered by Sandia and Livermore,

2349
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:47,380
two FFRDCs.

2350
01:31:47,380 --> 01:31:51,300
The program was ran by the NSA, CIA, and NRO,

2351
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:53,220
and the contractors at work were Northrop Grumman,

2352
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:55,220
Lockheed Martin, Boeing, a couple others.

2353
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:56,060
But here's what's-

2354
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:58,740
I hate to say this, this all makes so much sense,

2355
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:01,700
but it just fits so well with all the other stuff you learned.

2356
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,180
This is the most interesting part to me

2357
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:05,060
about the whole TR-3B thing.

2358
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:05,900
Yeah.

2359
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:07,700
Fouchet says the pilots for this were plucked

2360
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:10,180
from the Air Force Test Pilot School,

2361
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:11,940
which takes place at Edwards,

2362
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:14,220
which is the 412th test wing.

2363
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:16,760
There's a witness that contacted Greer in 2023

2364
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:20,800
that I found his name, investigated him thoroughly

2365
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,160
in an Edwards piece that claimed he operated out

2366
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:26,640
of Edwards Air Force Base in Nellis and Area 51

2367
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:29,000
on testing reverse engineered vehicles.

2368
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,480
I have shown you a little bit about this guy, right,

2369
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,000
including like the work he did at the Pentagon,

2370
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,920
and Nellis, and Edwards,

2371
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,400
and he was a director of an electronic,

2372
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,600
or kind of an electronics warfare group at Edwards

2373
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,320
under the 412th test wing,

2374
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,720
which is exactly what Fouchet said

2375
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,320
tested the TR-3B vehicles.

2376
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,840
That is a phenomenal case.

2377
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,360
So what does he say exactly?

2378
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:53,720
So he said he tested reverse engineered vehicles.

2379
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:54,560
At Area 51.

2380
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:57,120
At Area 51, and Edwards.

2381
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,760
So he said in 1998 to 2002,

2382
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,920
this guy, Ed, was briefed into programs

2383
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:05,960
while he was at Nellis under the 98th range wing,

2384
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,160
which became the Nevada Test and Training Range,

2385
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,800
which is pretty interesting in itself,

2386
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,480
but that then in about 2006 he was sent to Edwards

2387
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,960
to actually work and set programs

2388
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,360
as a director of an electronics warfare group.

2389
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:20,800
And like I vetted this guy quite well.

2390
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,360
I've tried to contact him in numerous ways.

2391
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:24,480
Would you ever put out a story with him, or?

2392
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,720
If he would talk to me, I would instantly.

2393
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:27,640
Okay. Instantly.

2394
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,560
So you just know about, you're not in contact with him?

2395
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:30,880
My number is blocked by him.

2396
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,680
I've tried to call him, I've tried to email him.

2397
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,040
You've told me about him, yeah, yeah.

2398
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,640
I've tried to message him on social media.

2399
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:38,800
Funny enough, one time he accepted a Snapchat request,

2400
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,640
and I messaged him, but he never got back.

2401
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:41,480
He never got back?

2402
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:42,300
No.

2403
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:43,140
So this is what I think

2404
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:45,660
of the most consequential untapped testimonies there is.

2405
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:48,940
So many of these guys, as soon as you initiate contact,

2406
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:51,100
they say a little thing, and they say a thing,

2407
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,820
and they get kind of excited, and then they get spooked.

2408
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:55,820
Well, Greer did the right thing with this witness, Ed.

2409
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:57,740
He was gonna bring him in front of

2410
01:33:57,740 --> 01:34:00,380
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to testify.

2411
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:02,060
The guy got cold feet right beforehand.

2412
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:03,980
And I had this confirmed to me

2413
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:06,340
by elements of Senate and so forth,

2414
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,540
so this isn't just Greer saying that.

2415
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:10,620
But this guy was supposed to testify.

2416
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:12,260
By like a Senate aide, or like?

2417
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:13,100
Yeah.

2418
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:13,920
Okay.

2419
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,460
Yeah, and this guy was supposed to speak,

2420
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:16,300
but got cold feet.

2421
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:17,120
Why?

2422
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:17,960
Is that because he was threatened?

2423
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:18,800
I don't know.

2424
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,740
There's other, if you look through the Greer archive,

2425
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:21,580
there's other witnesses.

2426
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:23,460
It's actually really interesting to see witnesses

2427
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:25,420
who are going to talk to Greer and so forth,

2428
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:26,660
but then say they've been threatened

2429
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:30,580
with some really horrible crimes, like really gross stuff.

2430
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:31,420
So messed up.

2431
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:34,260
Yeah, that if they continue to talk will happen.

2432
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:35,940
I just don't understand why there isn't

2433
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:39,700
some sort of limited disclosure around these things existing.

2434
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:42,700
Because it's like in the event in which,

2435
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:45,120
we're at par with China and Russia,

2436
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:48,180
why wouldn't you let out some like basic surface area

2437
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:49,220
that this stuff exists?

2438
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:52,340
Like that's what, is it just this bureaucratic

2439
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:53,700
bullshit overhang?

2440
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:55,620
Or are there real national security reasons

2441
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:56,780
for not letting this stuff out?

2442
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:58,500
And not letting it fully out,

2443
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,700
but like nuclear physics is not classified.

2444
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:02,940
Nuclear trade secrets are.

2445
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:05,540
Why is that not fully analogous to this?

2446
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:07,700
I mean, it must be, even looking at the testimony of Ed,

2447
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:09,500
he said 2009 to 2010,

2448
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:11,540
he was part of an Air Force going public plan

2449
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:13,940
that was called off by a two-star general.

2450
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:14,780
Why?

2451
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:15,620
Yeah, there are all these,

2452
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:20,180
well, it's like you had under the Bush White House,

2453
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:23,540
Bush 43, they were gonna do this sort of possible,

2454
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:25,500
they were thinking about disclosure

2455
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,740
and Hal Puthoff was part of this advisory group

2456
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:29,280
and they were talking about it.

2457
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:32,740
And anyways, Bush 43, so Hal Puthoff is on record

2458
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:35,540
saying that Bush 43 contemplated disclosure

2459
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:38,420
with Stephen Hadley, National Security Advisor,

2460
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:42,540
and Dick Cheney who David Grush is on record saying

2461
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:46,540
was one of the gatekeepers for the program.

2462
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:49,780
And they decided that it was too ontologically shocking

2463
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:50,620
to let this out

2464
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:54,540
and that we couldn't publicly disclose about UFOs.

2465
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:56,340
And I think that turned into a group

2466
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:57,340
where they were reading about,

2467
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:59,080
like they're reading the three body problem

2468
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:00,740
and other things like that.

2469
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:03,500
So super interesting.

2470
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:05,660
I mean, this could also boil down to.

2471
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:07,260
And the three body problem for people that don't know

2472
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:09,060
is a Chinese science fiction novel.

2473
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:09,900
It's a great series.

2474
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:10,740
It's a great series.

2475
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:14,060
It involves basically like aliens controlling

2476
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:18,780
almost all frontier science and sort of reality itself

2477
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:22,460
and being able to stagnate but also upstart physics.

2478
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:26,500
And yeah, reality being sort of information theoretic

2479
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:29,180
in nature and the whole thing is so fascinating.

2480
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:33,180
And this could all deal with the subject of ARVs

2481
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:35,100
but real quick, you mentioned Dick Cheney,

2482
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:37,580
a little interesting factoid

2483
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:39,900
is there is a supposed S4 whistleblower

2484
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:42,340
named Derek Hennessey who claimed he was a Navy SEAL.

2485
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:44,020
He wasn't a Navy SEAL, I had this confirmed.

2486
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:45,780
So already not off to a good start.

2487
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:48,140
But he claimed he worked at S4

2488
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:51,820
and sometime in the mid 90s that Dick Cheney came into S4.

2489
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:54,300
But the funny connection there is that,

2490
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:55,340
I can't remember the exact year

2491
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:57,380
but Dick Cheney was actually going around to air bases

2492
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:59,680
around the US to close up what he didn't think

2493
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,620
was operating efficiently.

2494
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:02,460
So that's kind of a funny connection.

2495
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:05,300
So we know that he was going around to air force bases.

2496
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:06,820
That's fascinating.

2497
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:08,540
But Derek Hennessey lied about being a SEAL

2498
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:09,380
so we don't know.

2499
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:11,580
So we don't know what's up there.

2500
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:14,380
I mean, yeah, the Dick Cheney thing,

2501
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:16,340
I don't know what to think about it

2502
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:19,980
but if there was a government behind our government,

2503
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:22,940
Dick Cheney would be the tip of the spear of that thing.

2504
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:26,140
Like if you read the Spartan Gelman biography of him,

2505
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,500
his called The Engler.

2506
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,140
And it's like that dude single-handedly architected

2507
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:33,540
the Iraq war based on like false intelligence.

2508
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:37,660
And he was a representative of a lot of oligarchic

2509
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:39,260
sort of corporate interests.

2510
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:41,460
And then Hal Burton gets the contract

2511
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:43,060
once we go kind of screw up Iraq

2512
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:44,140
and then he gets the contract.

2513
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:46,860
It's like, there's something to that guy

2514
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:50,820
where you even read George W. Bush's book, Decision Points.

2515
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:53,620
And you're like, yeah, your decisions locally

2516
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:56,700
are being made based on certain intelligence

2517
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:57,540
being given to you.

2518
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:58,960
And those decisions actually don't seem

2519
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,560
extremely irrational at each moment.

2520
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:03,600
And then it's like, who's giving you the intel

2521
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,320
and it's fucking Dick Cheney.

2522
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:08,360
And like, there's some other guys like Wolfowitz

2523
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:10,900
and sort of cast of Neocon characters,

2524
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,800
but like Cheney's at the heart of it.

2525
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,000
Yeah, I mean, he would make sense as a person

2526
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,760
at the top of the pyramid like Grush is.

2527
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,640
Yes, yeah, person at the top of the pyramid

2528
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:21,320
and maybe of a lineage.

2529
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:24,680
I'm about to do a piece on Henry Kissinger in UFOs.

2530
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:26,200
And I think there's some connections there.

2531
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:28,440
And it's like, if you pick a modern Henry Kissinger,

2532
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,560
it would be Dick Cheney.

2533
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:33,200
It's like this guy is the man behind the man.

2534
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:37,680
Right, so we were talking about the ARV and the TR-3B.

2535
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,400
And according to Fouche and so forth,

2536
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:44,160
that's not the only triangular alien reproduction vehicle

2537
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,860
that's in kind of UFO lore.

2538
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:48,900
There's also, if you reference forensic artists,

2539
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,360
I've talked about this a few times,

2540
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,280
Bill McDonald, who's done a lot of work

2541
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:54,160
on drawing the Roswell craft.

2542
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:56,280
He actually worked with Robert and Ryan Wood

2543
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:59,780
to create the two extraterrestrial biological entities

2544
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:01,440
mentioned in the majestic document,

2545
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,560
the Special Operations Manual.

2546
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:06,720
In 1992, McDonald met with two Northrop

2547
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:09,600
and two Lockheed engineers who were fed up with the secrecy

2548
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,400
and classification of their work,

2549
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:14,920
who kind of dictated a drawing of a triangular ARV

2550
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:17,480
called the XF-131 Super Sentinel

2551
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:20,480
that operated off of like RCS,

2552
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:23,240
Radar Cross-Section Facilities in the Mojave Desert.

2553
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:25,480
And I've talked to McDonald about this

2554
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:27,560
and he maintains the secrecy of these engineers

2555
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:28,400
to this day, because I said,

2556
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,160
hey, can I talk to these people?

2557
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:32,960
But that design actually was featured

2558
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,680
in the first ever episode of the X-Files

2559
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:38,040
because I can't, Chris, or Curtis?

2560
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:38,880
Chris Carr.

2561
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,280
Yeah, Chris, yeah.

2562
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:42,000
Contracted Bill McDonald to put that in the.

2563
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,640
Chris Carr is the creator of the X-Files.

2564
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:46,120
Right, Bill McDonald was contracted to put that

2565
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:48,400
in the first ever episode of the X-Files,

2566
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,080
which was allegedly based on true stories from John DeSouza.

2567
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:53,800
And that episode is about a triangular alien reproduction,

2568
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,400
triangular alien reproduction vehicle

2569
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,920
that's seen over an Air Force base.

2570
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:58,760
And it's the same design.

2571
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,680
I've featured some clips of that.

2572
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:02,000
That's so interesting.

2573
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,240
I think Hollywood has been engaging

2574
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:07,320
in soft UFO disclosure for 30 or 40 years

2575
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:09,440
through these CAA liaisons.

2576
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,160
We have Spielberg's new movie Disclosure.

2577
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:13,840
It's now called Disclosure.

2578
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,880
And I was talking to Chris Ramsey again,

2579
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:17,880
great YouTube channel, go follow at area52.

2580
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,880
And he was like, what if a UFO is shown

2581
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:20,720
as part of that movie?

2582
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,520
Would that not be the best way to disclose?

2583
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:25,120
And like, I'm kind of, I'm on his side.

2584
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:26,880
And maybe that happens.

2585
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,400
And then historically too, you've had, you know,

2586
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,960
close encounters with the third kind,

2587
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:35,480
which involves Jacques Vallee and Jalen Hynek.

2588
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:38,120
Jacques Vallee is played as a character by Francois Truffaut.

2589
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:40,720
You see crates that say Lockheed in Northrop.

2590
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:41,560
Don't they say TRW?

2591
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:43,040
The skunk works in TRW.

2592
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:43,880
TRW.

2593
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:45,680
If they say that, then you're like, okay,

2594
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:47,160
they're talking about next level knowledge.

2595
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:48,160
Then they really know.

2596
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:51,040
Because TRW was bought by Northrop in 2002.

2597
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:51,880
Right.

2598
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:54,080
And TRW was the contractor behind the Zodiac story,

2599
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,280
which was an alleged crash.

2600
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,080
So I think they do say skunk works in,

2601
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:00,560
because close encounters with the third kind was,

2602
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,400
they do?

2603
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:02,240
Okay, I don't know.

2604
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:04,160
Interesting fact about TRW.

2605
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,560
Jacques Vallee has talked about Dr. Eric A. Walker.

2606
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,760
We talked about earlier being on the board of directors

2607
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,320
or a chairman of TRW as well.

2608
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:11,160
Oh, wow.

2609
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:12,000
Fascinating.

2610
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:14,960
Yeah, I mean, Spielberg was dialed in with,

2611
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:18,840
you have to go deep to talk about skunk works in TRW

2612
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,160
in the film.

2613
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,000
Yeah.

2614
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,760
Well, let's look up, you know, at some point,

2615
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,080
whether it's Lockheed and Northrop.

2616
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:24,920
It's skunk works.

2617
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:25,760
You're sure?

2618
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:26,580
Yeah, skunk works in TRW.

2619
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:27,420
Well, that's next level.

2620
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:28,320
Then yeah, he knows a lot of knowledge.

2621
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,040
Also on the Townsend Brown,

2622
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:32,360
who I am sure discovered some interesting effects

2623
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:33,560
in the world of gravity.

2624
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:35,000
I'm sure of that.

2625
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,360
I feel very high conviction in that.

2626
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,000
And I just interviewed Carl Nell,

2627
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,360
who's the deputy CTO of Northrop Grumman,

2628
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:42,560
where I'm saying again,

2629
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:46,640
that this gravity technology got probably implemented

2630
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,000
in the B2 stealth bomber.

2631
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,680
And he's the deputy CTO of Northrop Grumman.

2632
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,480
And he goes, go watch Jesse's video

2633
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:52,900
on Thomas Townsend Brown.

2634
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:55,320
When I ask him, is there anything sort of useful

2635
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:57,240
or applicable in the UFO story?

2636
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,000
Jesse's done a number of podcasts

2637
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,080
looking into Taylor Townsend Brown

2638
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:05,320
and some other very interesting like heretical technologies.

2639
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:08,360
So I'd invite people, an unsolicited plug

2640
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:10,840
to check out some of Jesse's podcasts.

2641
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:13,880
So there's more corroboration beyond that

2642
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,800
on the T.T. Brown stuff.

2643
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:19,040
But where was I going with?

2644
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:19,880
What were you just saying?

2645
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:23,440
TRW, Close to Cutters of the Third Kind before that.

2646
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:24,480
Oh, okay.

2647
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,800
So Steven Spielberg,

2648
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,320
executive produced Back to the Future.

2649
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:33,080
And the subplot of the whole Thomas Townsend Brown story

2650
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:35,200
is that gravity affects time.

2651
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:36,280
In general relativity,

2652
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:39,320
gravity and time are tightly coupled and they're related.

2653
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:43,160
And he talks about time travel constantly with his family.

2654
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:44,160
Like that's something that's really,

2655
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:45,320
and if you think about it,

2656
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:48,000
if we were to ever engage in effective interstellar travel,

2657
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,240
it would involve space-time metric engineering inherently.

2658
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,520
You can't get around that.

2659
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:54,080
Even with nuclear thermal propulsion,

2660
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:57,040
you get to the closest star system in 40,000 years.

2661
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:59,480
Biologically, that does not work, right?

2662
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:02,360
So he's super into time travel.

2663
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:04,040
And then you have Back to the Future come out,

2664
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:06,560
which is a Steven Spielberg executive produced movie.

2665
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,320
The guy's name is Doc Brown,

2666
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,040
which everybody called Thomas Townsend Brown.

2667
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:13,480
His name is Emmett Brown, E-M-E-T-T Brown.

2668
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:15,760
Thomas Townsend Brown is in the name.

2669
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,640
He uses his flux capacitor.

2670
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:18,920
Thomas Townsend Brown's experiments

2671
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:21,320
are capacitor experiments.

2672
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:24,760
And he goes back in time in 1985,

2673
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:28,440
which is the year Thomas Townsend Brown dies to 1957,

2674
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:29,920
which is when I think his experiment

2675
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:33,120
was first experimentally proven around that time

2676
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,960
at the Bonson Labs.

2677
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:35,720
It's the time that physics sort of went astray

2678
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:37,200
in the wrong direction

2679
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,920
when I think the anti-gravity stuff went black.

2680
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,480
And so it's just, I don't know.

2681
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:45,440
There's so much there that I think begets this like greater.

2682
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,480
And then E-T even is extremely interesting.

2683
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,200
E-T and the kid like lock it,

2684
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:53,400
like they have some sort of weird psionic connection.

2685
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,600
And you remember they're in the hospital together.

2686
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:57,240
And E-T's like heart rate

2687
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:59,120
is matching the kid's heart rate.

2688
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,480
And you have all this stuff around the psionic connection

2689
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,480
that's now coming out.

2690
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:05,080
You also have the consciousness connection there

2691
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:07,840
where the mother is walking around the kitchen.

2692
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,120
And like these kids have taken,

2693
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,760
these kids see the E-Ts, but the mother doesn't.

2694
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:14,600
And like the E-T is sort of like walking around the fridge

2695
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:15,440
and the mother doesn't see it.

2696
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,280
Cause like her perceptive,

2697
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:20,120
she's closed off to these realities.

2698
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:24,840
So like I think Steven Spielberg definitely has been fed

2699
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:27,560
some really interesting UFO stuff over the years.

2700
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:29,000
And was it Spielberg or Cameron

2701
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,040
that created the film The Abyss?

2702
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:31,880
That was James Cameron.

2703
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:34,480
Okay, cause that's also an interesting one about USO.

2704
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:35,680
Totally.

2705
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:37,800
It's interesting to see these concepts

2706
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,480
relate in Hollywood cause.

2707
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:41,680
James Cameron, Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan

2708
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:44,800
are definitely fed intense secret shit.

2709
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,640
Yeah.

2710
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:46,480
They have to be, I'm sorry.

2711
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,340
Cause on one hand you have films like Independence Day,

2712
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:52,560
which is just a bombastic action film glorified.

2713
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,680
But then on the other hand, you have very thoughtful projects

2714
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:56,120
like Close Encounters of the Third Kind

2715
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:59,160
and to an extent E-T and as we know now.

2716
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:03,560
But even like where does the concept of men in black get to?

2717
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:05,080
Men in black sounds quacky.

2718
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:05,920
Yeah.

2719
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,480
But like if you go talk to Richard Dolan,

2720
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:10,040
he's a super deep UFO researcher.

2721
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:12,880
Men in black, they are this thing.

2722
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:15,020
They're in these suits and they show up

2723
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:18,560
after UFO abduction experiences, UFO sightings.

2724
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:20,500
And they often take people's footage

2725
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,760
or like, you know, swear them to secrecy.

2726
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:25,160
And he thinks, Dolan thinks they're almost like

2727
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:28,000
the counter intel group of the aliens themselves.

2728
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,520
They erase your memory.

2729
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,920
And so it's turned into this like kind of jokey, funny,

2730
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,560
you know, movie with Will Smith.

2731
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:34,480
But like even that,

2732
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,840
like where is that derived to begin with?

2733
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:37,680
Right.

2734
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:40,520
It's just so fascinating, you know.

2735
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:41,960
That's interesting that,

2736
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:43,640
cause I've heard that idea floated around before

2737
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:45,760
that the like colloquial men in black

2738
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,600
are almost like a non-human entity.

2739
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,880
Cause I almost, I'd like to hear more about that

2740
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:51,240
cause I almost stand on the other side.

2741
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:53,200
I straight up think that the men in black

2742
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,940
in a sense are NSA spooks.

2743
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:57,760
So I would say the same thing,

2744
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,560
but like how do you meet with certain people

2745
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:03,560
like Whitley Strieber and other just experiencers

2746
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:07,240
and like these guys seem to like

2747
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,800
have technology available to them

2748
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:11,880
that's not available to the general public.

2749
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:13,800
And maybe that is just like, okay,

2750
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,200
so it's like Occam's razor, it's like NSA or something,

2751
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,160
but it's weird technology.

2752
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:23,160
It's like implants that involve technological mediumship

2753
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:24,000
as Whitley Strieber.

2754
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,440
I felt his implant in his ear.

2755
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,280
Really?

2756
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:27,100
Yeah, I felt it.

2757
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:28,200
And it's the weirdest thing I've ever heard.

2758
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,240
And he says it moves with his own metabolism.

2759
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:31,800
I haven't verified that, but like.

2760
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:33,000
Has he ever thought about getting that cut out?

2761
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,040
He wants to get it cut out,

2762
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:35,360
but he says it moves every time.

2763
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,560
And I felt the thing and it's not natural.

2764
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:40,120
So unless he's totally grifting

2765
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:41,520
and putting the thing in his ear,

2766
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,720
even though he's not really like making that much money now

2767
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:46,240
off of UFOs and it happened after he wrote Communion

2768
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:49,100
and like, it's like, I don't know, man.

2769
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:50,560
The whole thing's so strange.

2770
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:51,600
That is interesting.

2771
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:54,900
You know, perhaps the two are not mutually exclusive

2772
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:58,080
cause there's also stories like, have you heard of TREAT?

2773
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:02,440
It's the supposed men in black unit out of the NSA

2774
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:03,880
called the Tactical Reconnaissance

2775
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:05,720
Engineering Assessment Search Team,

2776
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,520
which was created by Stubblebine.

2777
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:08,360
Ah.

2778
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:10,600
And it's only ever been talked about by Fouche

2779
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:13,680
and Hans Adams, the Crown Prince of Liechtenstein.

2780
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:16,840
So that's come up for me and I've never brought that up,

2781
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:18,280
but yeah.

2782
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:20,880
Well, how do you think that the Crown Prince of Liechtenstein,

2783
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,120
cause I've heard some very interesting things about him.

2784
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:24,680
He seems like a really cool guy,

2785
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:27,440
but like really interested in the spooky science stuff.

2786
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,200
I've only ever seen his discussions with like Greer

2787
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,880
in the emails on the DPI archive

2788
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,520
and looked up a few things about him

2789
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,240
and him mentioning TREAT.

2790
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:38,200
Besides that, I have no idea because I would see that.

2791
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,920
And I said, Crown Prince of Liechtenstein,

2792
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:43,040
a small central European company.

2793
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,600
What have you found out about him?

2794
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:45,440
Cause that's pretty interesting.

2795
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,080
I don't, you know, I don't know.

2796
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:50,040
I probably shouldn't say

2797
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:52,860
because the conversations I've had are in confidence,

2798
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:54,920
but he seems very interesting

2799
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:56,360
and interested in sort of secret science.

2800
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:59,880
One more piece of possible corroboration of, you know,

2801
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:02,560
maybe it being a combo as far as the men in black

2802
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:05,600
is I did speak to Hal Puthoff recently

2803
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,660
and I was trying to figure out, I was like,

2804
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:09,080
is it their program?

2805
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:11,400
You know, is it the NHI program or is it our program?

2806
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:13,600
And he goes, what if it's a joint space program?

2807
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,000
He goes, I might believe that.

2808
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,120
Maybe there's something in where we're in.

2809
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:18,600
He did, yeah.

2810
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:19,440
To me.

2811
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:20,280
Jeez.

2812
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:22,460
Yeah, so and Hal Puthoff is, I think as deep as it gets

2813
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:26,000
when it comes to sort of outside the Overton window science,

2814
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,440
which is now being vindicated.

2815
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,840
I mean, he was just on a podcast in December,

2816
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:33,640
which is co-sponsored by National Science Foundation.

2817
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:36,360
And like you had like pretty high up DOE people

2818
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,240
on the podcast and all these amazing people

2819
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:40,480
with pretty impressive credentials.

2820
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,620
The former head of revolutionary tech at Skunk Works

2821
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:44,200
are all in this podcast.

2822
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,440
And he's talking about extended electrodynamics

2823
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:48,200
and gravity manipulation.

2824
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:51,760
And I think it's clearly this sort of limited hangout

2825
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:54,560
where it's like, let's partially expose some things

2826
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:58,080
so that people can, you know, learn a little bit more

2827
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,680
about some science that we've been sitting on,

2828
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,000
especially again, if China has caught up,

2829
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,680
you can't just, you know,

2830
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:05,200
throw people off the trail constantly.

2831
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:07,160
You need some limited surface area around it.

2832
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:08,840
But yeah, Hal Puthoff did say,

2833
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:11,240
and you know, it's always, I love Hal,

2834
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:13,000
but it's always this sort of like, you know,

2835
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,040
tongue in cheek, like half speculating.

2836
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:15,880
So you never quite know.

2837
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,040
Yeah, because he never commits to,

2838
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,160
he never commits to something.

2839
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:19,880
He always goes, the whole zoo of possibilities.

2840
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:21,400
And it's like A, B, C, and D,

2841
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:23,160
and then you have to decide, you know.

2842
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:25,600
I, sometimes I wonder about Hal

2843
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:27,720
and how much he'll commit to subjects.

2844
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:29,120
Because under his tutelage and good friend,

2845
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:30,960
of course, is Eric Davis.

2846
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,240
And recently, like, as you know,

2847
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:35,800
Missile Man, myself, and others talking to Eric Davis.

2848
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:38,120
You did a great interview with Eric Davis.

2849
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:39,440
He said a lot of interesting things,

2850
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,480
but he also said some, a couple of things I disagree with.

2851
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:44,480
One, he said that the only FFRDC he knew of

2852
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,760
was the Aerospace Corporation, which I disagree with,

2853
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:48,320
but I think that's because he was only read

2854
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:51,000
into a sub selection of legacy programs under OSAP.

2855
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,080
But he also said that

2856
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,120
alien reproduction vehicles don't exist.

2857
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:55,400
Do you think there's aircraft systems

2858
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:57,360
that have kind of leveraged technologies?

2859
01:49:57,680 --> 01:50:00,760
Definitely no aircraft systems that have leveraged anything.

2860
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:03,440
And there's been no one-to-one reproduction.

2861
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:08,320
A lot of that fell into the psyche of the UFO community

2862
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:11,400
because of Bob Lazar and then Brad Sorensen

2863
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:13,080
and Mark McCandless.

2864
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:16,080
So, I don't know where they're coming from.

2865
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,520
And then other people kind of came out of the woodwork

2866
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:21,320
saying the same thing, but no proof.

2867
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:23,000
Right, and I'm only left with two possibilities

2868
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,200
when I think about that.

2869
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,680
One is that he's lying.

2870
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:27,000
Two is that he was only read

2871
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,240
into a select subsection of programs

2872
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:30,760
that only overlapped Lockheed

2873
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:32,440
trying to get rid of Kingman materials,

2874
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:34,520
and thus he would not know about ARV

2875
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:37,720
because those weren't part of the program.

2876
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:40,800
And I kind of lean towards that explanation

2877
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:43,480
because I really don't agree with that assessment.

2878
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:45,840
And at the end of the interview,

2879
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,400
I had a little notebook with the flux liner on it,

2880
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,720
and I said, you know, Dr. Davis,

2881
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:53,400
you really haven't even considered this testimony

2882
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,200
of Mark McCandless and the flux liner.

2883
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:57,240
And he said, but right before we cut off,

2884
01:50:57,240 --> 01:51:00,160
well, Hal Puthoff interviewed Brad Sorensen,

2885
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:02,080
and we never got to talk about that more.

2886
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:04,640
And to this day, I want to ask him so badly

2887
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:08,360
about how that went because Hal has spoken to Sorensen.

2888
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:09,200
Wow.

2889
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:10,640
And I just need to know how that goes.

2890
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,760
I wish Hal could speak a little bit more candidly

2891
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,840
in an open setting because he's also super cagey

2892
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:16,240
in the program with James Fox,

2893
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:19,880
and he's also kind of integral to the story of Zodiac,

2894
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:21,840
the alleged crash retrieval program

2895
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,400
first introduced in UFO Magazine in 1998.

2896
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,440
What is Zodiac?

2897
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,080
God, that's a really interesting one.

2898
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:32,040
So in 1998, UFO Magazine published a story

2899
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:36,920
by pseudonym Greg Halifax about Sedge Masters,

2900
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:39,220
a story about somebody who is brought

2901
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:42,400
into a UFO crash retrieval program called Zodiac.

2902
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:45,120
This occurred in 1988, 2001 or 2002,

2903
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:47,880
there's an email chain with Hal Puthoff,

2904
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:50,280
Kit Green, and Eric Davis talking about

2905
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:54,300
the Santilli alien autopsy film and so forth,

2906
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:56,380
and Kit Green saying he saw different pictures

2907
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:57,340
of an alien autopsy.

2908
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:59,740
But then in a later thread in that email,

2909
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:02,180
somebody, one of the three brings up Zodiac

2910
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:04,420
in the Sedge Masters story.

2911
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:07,140
And most of this work needs to be credited

2912
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:09,100
to, of course, Richard Dolan,

2913
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:12,840
who actually tracked down the very likely author

2914
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:15,260
of the Zodiac story and puts a lot of faith

2915
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:17,740
that the Zodiac was indeed a crash retrieval program

2916
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:19,560
and it was operated by TRW.

2917
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:20,700
So that's just a fascinating story

2918
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:23,500
how even it seems like everything kind of post 2000

2919
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:26,180
or post 1995, Hal, Eric, and Kit.

2920
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:28,180
What is the core story of Zodiac?

2921
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:29,020
Like what is?

2922
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:31,980
It's essentially the Majestic 12 by another name.

2923
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:34,700
Because the Majestic 12, for people who don't know,

2924
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:38,900
was introduced under, the Majestic 12 documents

2925
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:41,700
first appeared in 1984 in a film canister

2926
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:45,400
to TV producer Jamie Chanderay,

2927
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,940
and this included the Eisenhower briefing document

2928
01:52:47,940 --> 01:52:49,900
and later the special operations manual

2929
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:51,940
and then a whole host of other documents.

2930
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:53,380
And this details the Majestic 12,

2931
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:56,540
a supposed UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering group

2932
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:58,980
spearheaded by Vannevar Bush, including Dr. Ross,

2933
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:03,460
or including Roscoe Hillencoder, Dr. Donald Menzel,

2934
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:07,140
I think his name is, Von Neumann.

2935
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:11,420
Von Neumann, Jerome Hunsaker, who else?

2936
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:12,260
Denzel Ward.

2937
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:13,500
Vandenberg.

2938
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:14,340
Yeah.

2939
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:16,900
Hoyt Vandenberg, Nathan Twining.

2940
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:18,300
You have a bunch of head honchos

2941
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,100
in military intelligence science.

2942
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:24,460
And so, you know, Majestic 12, Zodiac 12, 12 signs.

2943
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:26,980
Some might suggest in the realm of UFO study

2944
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:29,140
that Zodiac is another name for Majestic 12,

2945
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:31,100
just like Majestic 12 has been called other names,

2946
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:33,620
like the Working Group, the PI-40,

2947
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:35,740
by that guy A.H. we talked about with Greer.

2948
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:37,640
So it's a super interesting story

2949
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:39,900
that I hope sees more coverage,

2950
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:42,940
because Richard Dolan has been a true trailblazer

2951
01:53:42,940 --> 01:53:44,140
in the Zodiac story,

2952
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:47,180
and it's just kind of like the secret retrieval team.

2953
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:49,740
So to be quite plain after talking with Ryan Wood,

2954
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:52,860
I think the Majestic 12 did exist in a capacity

2955
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:53,980
and probably still exists today,

2956
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:55,580
but I am hesitant to think about

2957
01:53:55,580 --> 01:53:57,620
like a very ubiquitous crash retrieval team.

2958
01:53:57,620 --> 01:54:00,220
I think that there's a very wide swath

2959
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:02,380
of retrieval teams and retrieval operations.

2960
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:05,140
Well, there are people who I think are pretty credible

2961
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:05,980
who talk about this,

2962
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:07,940
like these continuity of government programs.

2963
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:08,780
Yeah.

2964
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:11,060
So the 5412 committee, you know,

2965
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:13,780
national security committee, you know,

2966
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:14,800
back in the 50s and 60s,

2967
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,820
that turned into the 303 committee,

2968
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:18,420
which turned into the committee of 40.

2969
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:20,060
Do you have anything to say about that

2970
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:21,220
as far as they're kind of, you know,

2971
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:22,060
interested in UFOs?

2972
01:54:22,060 --> 01:54:24,460
Only thing I know is that Colonel John B. Alexander

2973
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:26,500
said that the Majestic 12 was specifically

2974
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:28,140
a continuity of government program.

2975
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:28,980
Right.

2976
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:31,900
But I hasten to adhere to what he says,

2977
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:34,860
because he lied about the special operations manual.

2978
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:36,060
He lied about a bunch of stuff.

2979
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:36,900
Yeah.

2980
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:38,900
And even in the Wilson memo, you know,

2981
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:40,300
where they said that, you know, the Wilson,

2982
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:41,140
of course, you know, the Wilson memo.

2983
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:41,980
Yeah, absolutely.

2984
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:45,020
So this is, was it 1997?

2985
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:47,980
1997 was when the Greer, Will Miller,

2986
01:54:48,540 --> 01:54:50,780
Thomas Wilson, Stephen Lovekin meeting took place.

2987
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:51,820
The briefing took place.

2988
01:54:51,820 --> 01:54:52,660
Okay, interesting.

2989
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:54,100
But when was, and then-

2990
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:55,020
2002.

2991
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:57,820
2002 is this meeting between Eric Davis,

2992
01:54:57,820 --> 01:54:59,500
who's again, this HAL put off protege,

2993
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:02,940
propulsions expert, and like exotic physics expert.

2994
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:05,620
It's in the parking lot of EG&G,

2995
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:08,180
and he's meeting with Admiral Thomas Wilson,

2996
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:11,940
who's head of joint chiefs, joint chiefs J2,

2997
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:12,780
you know-

2998
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:14,380
He was like intelligence for JCS at the time.

2999
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:16,820
So he should have like all exotic tech under his purview,

3000
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:17,740
and he's extremely,

3001
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:20,060
he's basically expressing extreme dissatisfaction

3002
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:24,980
that you had these rogue groups working on purportedly UFOs,

3003
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:28,260
who he met with, and it's out of his jurisdiction.

3004
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:29,860
And in that document,

3005
01:55:29,860 --> 01:55:33,500
that I believe was found in the Edgar Mitchell estate,

3006
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:36,900
in that document, it says JA is a liar,

3007
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:39,140
and I think JA is John Alexander.

3008
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:39,980
Yeah.

3009
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:42,740
Yeah, cause John Alexander has been publicly said,

3010
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:46,020
oh, majestic 12 exists that had nothing to do with UFOs,

3011
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:48,860
and kind of all of that before.

3012
01:55:48,860 --> 01:55:51,620
And of course, he kind of said myths, truths

3013
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:53,140
about what Dr. Ryan Wood said

3014
01:55:53,140 --> 01:55:54,580
about the special operations manual.

3015
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:57,860
Ryan Wood and Robert Wood did a ton of provenance research

3016
01:55:57,860 --> 01:55:59,540
on the majestic documents,

3017
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:02,300
getting the physical onion skin documents,

3018
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:04,380
putting them through rigorous testing of materials.

3019
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:05,700
So what do you think about these documents?

3020
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:09,100
Cause they're popular view,

3021
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:10,660
like with those kind of old school,

3022
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:14,020
like UFO researchers, like Robert Hastings,

3023
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:15,940
you know, who wrote UFOs and nukes,

3024
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:18,500
this was passage material.

3025
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:20,620
So it was like meant to detect spies,

3026
01:56:20,620 --> 01:56:22,140
it contained all sorts of falsities.

3027
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:23,620
You're giving it to this film producer

3028
01:56:23,620 --> 01:56:25,340
who's friends with all these UFO researchers,

3029
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:26,180
Jamie Chandra.

3030
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:28,660
And then I think other versions of the majestic 12

3031
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:32,940
were then doled out in packages to other UFO researchers.

3032
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:34,860
Cause there's a whole host of documents,

3033
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:39,500
and the source cannot be all from the same person.

3034
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:42,620
And a bunch of varying quality documents.

3035
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:45,060
I tend to adhere to the work of Stanton Friedman,

3036
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:47,060
who spent a bunch of time authenticating

3037
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:49,380
these special operations manual

3038
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:51,740
and Eisenhower briefing document with the woods.

3039
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:54,180
I think those two probably have the strongest claims

3040
01:56:54,180 --> 01:56:56,460
of real documents, as well as the two

3041
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:59,460
IPU interplanetary phenomenon unit reports.

3042
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:00,940
One of them is a seven page report

3043
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:03,900
that sounds very similar to the Eisenhower briefing document

3044
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:06,700
and talks about the Roswell crash retrieval and so forth.

3045
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:07,700
Later on down the line,

3046
01:57:07,700 --> 01:57:10,180
you get a lot of other documents like the burned memo

3047
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:13,340
and the project Aquarius document from Lee Graham.

3048
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:15,860
The burned memo or the project Aquarius,

3049
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:16,700
one of them I can't remember,

3050
01:57:16,700 --> 01:57:18,580
which actually makes reference to project Zodiac,

3051
01:57:18,580 --> 01:57:22,100
by the way, and like project Jehovah and MKUltra.

3052
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:24,860
But a lot of the earlier documents

3053
01:57:24,860 --> 01:57:26,260
like the Eisenhower briefing document,

3054
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:29,180
a lot of the dates and specific discussions

3055
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:32,020
line up with real events.

3056
01:57:32,020 --> 01:57:34,700
For example, James Forrestal meeting with Truman,

3057
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:36,940
dates are mentioned when those two met

3058
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:38,100
and kind of discuss the future

3059
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:40,340
or the inception of majestic 12 and so forth.

3060
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:41,740
If you look in the library of Truman,

3061
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:44,780
library of Eisenhower when he supposedly briefed,

3062
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:46,500
these presidents and president incumbents

3063
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:47,340
had these meetings.

3064
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:48,940
I believe Dulles' diary recently came out

3065
01:57:48,940 --> 01:57:50,940
and it showed a meeting with him and Eisenhower

3066
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:52,980
or something and that was like a real meeting.

3067
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:54,860
And his diary came out

3068
01:57:54,860 --> 01:57:57,180
after the majestic 12 documents obviously had come out

3069
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:58,900
and they corroborated the information

3070
01:57:58,900 --> 01:57:59,940
in the majestic 12 documents.

3071
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:02,500
So it's probably similar to the Lazar stuff

3072
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:05,100
where it's like some of the stuff is just true.

3073
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:07,180
And then maybe true and under a different name

3074
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:08,540
and maybe they were looking for spies

3075
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:10,380
and there was some passage material involved,

3076
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:11,980
but yeah, it is interesting.

3077
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:13,300
And then there were other documents

3078
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:14,540
like the Cutler-Twining memo

3079
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:17,420
that is really difficult to dispute and so forth.

3080
01:58:17,420 --> 01:58:19,180
I was actually reading on the plane over here,

3081
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:21,620
different validation of majestic documents

3082
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:24,460
and there's just been a lot of mentions

3083
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:26,420
of majestic documents before,

3084
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:28,100
including, I can't remember the general's name,

3085
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:30,660
but a four-star general who was asked about the documents.

3086
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:31,940
He said they're real.

3087
01:58:31,940 --> 01:58:32,940
The majestic 12 is real.

3088
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:34,500
I can't tell you any more than that

3089
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,300
because I know that the majestic 12

3090
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:38,420
to many sort of hobbyists in this subject

3091
01:58:38,420 --> 01:58:41,860
is nothing more than kind of conspiracy material, right?

3092
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:44,700
They just think majestic 12 may not true, just.

3093
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:47,660
But if you were to simulate back then,

3094
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:52,660
if a UFO issue were a thing and we had exotic materials

3095
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:57,620
and we were in contact with an extraterrestrial

3096
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:59,940
or interdimensional intelligence,

3097
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:01,820
you would need our best and brightest on it.

3098
01:59:01,820 --> 01:59:03,940
And if you look at that list of people,

3099
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:06,900
those would be the people on it.

3100
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:09,100
Vannevar Bush would be heading it up.

3101
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:10,900
And then of course, Vannevar Bush is completely

3102
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:13,740
unconnected with Robert Zarbacher and Dr. Eric A. Walker

3103
01:59:13,740 --> 01:59:17,020
as also mentioned as the head of UFO research.

3104
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:17,860
That's right.

3105
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:20,300
And then you have Gordon Gray, who was also on the majestic.

3106
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:21,980
Don Menzel, who admitted,

3107
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:24,980
he was super read in on Navy, CIA,

3108
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:29,340
a bunch of pretty classified info

3109
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:32,300
and admitted as much actually to Kennedy.

3110
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:34,660
And Sam Friedman actually writes about this,

3111
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:37,700
was sort of in charge of disinfo and debunking,

3112
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:39,340
which he was debunking a lot of it.

3113
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:41,500
And there's this amazing Swedish astronomer,

3114
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:43,140
Beatriz Villarreal.

3115
01:59:43,140 --> 01:59:46,460
And she talks about Menzel having like deleted

3116
01:59:46,460 --> 01:59:50,020
like all this astronomical information from like 1953

3117
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:54,020
and onwards in, from the Harvard Observatory.

3118
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:55,900
And at the Harvard undersea observatory

3119
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:58,100
at the time you had Robert Zarbacher, he was working there.

3120
01:59:58,100 --> 02:00:00,220
And then the number, I think James Conant

3121
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:01,300
was the president of Harvard.

3122
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:03,500
And he was like the number two guy, you know,

3123
02:00:05,420 --> 02:00:06,820
the Manhattan project at the time.

3124
02:00:06,820 --> 02:00:08,740
So yeah, I don't know.

3125
02:00:08,740 --> 02:00:11,220
It's hard to say, but it sort of makes sense.

3126
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:12,740
It's directionally correct.

3127
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:13,580
Yeah.

3128
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:15,460
And you know, it's not unreasonable to think

3129
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:18,180
that the group evolved over time, changed names and so forth.

3130
02:00:18,180 --> 02:00:23,180
I mean, you have in 1987 or 86 or 87

3131
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:25,140
when Eric Walker is asked by Steinman

3132
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:26,140
about the majestic 12,

3133
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:28,500
and he gives the Don Quixote impersonation.

3134
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:29,860
You're chasing after windmills.

3135
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:32,220
It's impossible to chase after the majestic 12.

3136
02:00:32,220 --> 02:00:33,940
The majestic documents were first delivered

3137
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:37,620
to Chanderay and Friedman and so forth in 1984.

3138
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:40,820
That's when the first documents were actually kind of received

3139
02:00:40,820 --> 02:00:44,300
but weren't given to like a Muffin Symposium until 87.

3140
02:00:44,300 --> 02:00:46,340
What's interesting is the documents were kind of mailed out

3141
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:47,180
in 84.

3142
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:50,020
And then if we look at the manuscript of Corso,

3143
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:51,620
it kind of seems like around 86,

3144
02:00:51,620 --> 02:00:53,340
the majestic 12 took on a new name,

3145
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:55,300
the UFO working group and got new blood

3146
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:58,820
like Albert Stubblebine and some NSA people

3147
02:00:58,820 --> 02:01:00,060
and some CIA people.

3148
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:01,860
So it's interesting to think how this group

3149
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:03,620
may have evolved over time.

3150
02:01:04,140 --> 02:01:06,180
Possibly it changed its name to the working group

3151
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:08,460
because it was aware of the leaks at the time.

3152
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:09,900
The whole history is fascinating.

3153
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:14,900
I think maybe one of the tip of the spear frontier

3154
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:18,620
longitudinal timeline assessments of like,

3155
02:01:18,620 --> 02:01:22,140
all UFO oversight is this great article by Chris Sharpe

3156
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:23,220
at the Liberation Times.

3157
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:24,060
Oh yeah.

3158
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:25,700
It's really interesting stuff.

3159
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:27,300
And there's some connections you've made

3160
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:29,180
between Woods Hole and like,

3161
02:01:29,180 --> 02:01:30,020
some of the- Crane?

3162
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:31,780
Yeah, Crane, exactly. Crane and SAIC, yeah.

3163
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:33,700
And Randy Anderson's story.

3164
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:35,780
But I also just wanna touch on,

3165
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:38,660
he talks about how it was the OSS,

3166
02:01:38,660 --> 02:01:40,060
the Office of Strategic Services,

3167
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:41,740
which was before the National Security Act,

3168
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:44,460
before the CIA was formed.

3169
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:48,180
They were sort of in charge of the initial UFO custody.

3170
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:52,740
And I think we have a decent map of actually what occurred.

3171
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:55,300
So David Grush says that there's this magenta crash

3172
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:59,260
in Lombardy in Italy in 1933, exactly.

3173
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:01,740
I've now made the connection through some people

3174
02:02:02,740 --> 02:02:05,500
this woman, Pippa Malmgren, who's amazing.

3175
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:07,180
She's really interested in the UFO thing,

3176
02:02:07,180 --> 02:02:10,820
but she was actually special assistant to George W. Bush.

3177
02:02:10,820 --> 02:02:14,820
She made it clear to me that James Jesus Engleton

3178
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:19,820
was the US like OSS person involved in Italy at the time.

3179
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:25,100
And so rumors are that you have this magenta crash

3180
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:27,820
and then Mussolini goes to Hitler and says,

3181
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:29,980
is this yours to the Nazis?

3182
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:31,940
And then they end up working together on it.

3183
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:34,300
And so this magenta crash ends up

3184
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:35,940
probably being worked on by the Nazis,

3185
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:40,020
which explains these like Deglaca rumors

3186
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:43,620
and Komlerstab and sort of modern Czechoslovakia and Poland

3187
02:02:43,620 --> 02:02:45,220
where they're working on these flying saucers.

3188
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:47,060
You have tons of reports around this

3189
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:49,140
from Rudolf Schreiber, Richard Mita,

3190
02:02:49,140 --> 02:02:51,020
a bunch of guys at the time,

3191
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:53,940
along with Paul Mellon and Alan Dulles.

3192
02:02:53,940 --> 02:02:56,060
There's a story of Paul Mellon kind of spilling the beans

3193
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:59,620
to his grandson who's alive now, John Warner IV,

3194
02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:04,580
sitting, standing over a UFO

3195
02:03:04,580 --> 02:03:07,340
that can employ exotic flight principles

3196
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:09,540
in modern day Czechoslovakia.

3197
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:12,820
And so you kind of can come up with this thread

3198
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:15,480
of like the Lombardy magenta crash happens.

3199
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:17,020
It goes to the Nazis.

3200
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:18,260
Maybe there's some custody

3201
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:20,580
where the Vatican is involved as well.

3202
02:03:20,580 --> 02:03:21,420
I've heard that from Grush.

3203
02:03:21,420 --> 02:03:22,260
I've heard that from Grush.

3204
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:24,500
And then it goes over to the US

3205
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:28,060
and then it's worked on at Wright Airfield.

3206
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:30,700
And you have all these Operation Overcast

3207
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:33,700
paperclip Nazi scientists who then,

3208
02:03:33,700 --> 02:03:37,020
that's part of the rush to get the Nazi scientists

3209
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:39,780
is to get the ones who are like this deep

3210
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:44,000
on like really exotic flight principles and UFO stuff.

3211
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,020
We now know Hans Kammler himself

3212
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:47,900
who was in charge of the blackest of the black

3213
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:51,580
Wunderwaffe programs for the Nazis made his way to the US.

3214
02:03:51,580 --> 02:03:56,580
And so you kind of have this somewhat consistent narrative

3215
02:03:56,980 --> 02:03:59,780
of like what happened with this early UFO crash

3216
02:03:59,780 --> 02:04:02,540
and how the US started to get involved with this stuff.

3217
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:04,020
And all the guys who were involved

3218
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:07,040
in the early Marshall Plan and tech transfer programs,

3219
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,720
Kissinger was an army counterintel guy

3220
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:12,440
who was doing tech retrieval at the time.

3221
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:15,060
And you have other examples.

3222
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:15,980
You mentioned Forrestal.

3223
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:19,240
Forrestal was as well and he was secretary of the Navy.

3224
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:20,080
So-

3225
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:23,340
He threw himself out of the Naval Hospital in Bethesda.

3226
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:24,420
Yeah, exactly.

3227
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:26,820
Mid-Sophocles poem, yeah.

3228
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:28,420
And the Magenta case is so interesting

3229
02:04:28,420 --> 02:04:31,700
because Mussolini thought it was a Nazi advanced craft

3230
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:33,340
or a British or American advanced craft

3231
02:04:33,340 --> 02:04:36,940
when he had his own special investigation group, the RS-33,

3232
02:04:36,940 --> 02:04:39,620
who was like really keen on the fact

3233
02:04:39,620 --> 02:04:41,100
this wasn't human technology

3234
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:43,280
and then likely worked with the Nazis.

3235
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:46,540
Yeah, and apparently Marconi's grandson

3236
02:04:46,540 --> 02:04:48,540
might be like on the verge of saying something

3237
02:04:48,540 --> 02:04:51,740
of this Pinotti, this Italian UFO researcher

3238
02:04:51,740 --> 02:04:53,340
who's like really on that trail.

3239
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:55,980
I'd love to hear more of a description

3240
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:58,140
because the only real description we have

3241
02:04:58,140 --> 02:04:59,660
is from the RS-33 like a disc

3242
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:01,980
and then crushed like a lenticular shape.

3243
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:03,380
And that begs the question

3244
02:05:03,380 --> 02:05:05,700
when we brought over operation paperclip scientists,

3245
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:06,820
so Nazi scientists,

3246
02:05:06,820 --> 02:05:09,100
if there's kind of a collaboration

3247
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:10,860
in crash retrieval groups today.

3248
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:15,860
Even in 2023, you had a Canadian Parliament member,

3249
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:20,800
Larry Maguire, who wrote to the head of Canadian Defense

3250
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,700
wanting to bring the Canadian people up to speed

3251
02:05:22,700 --> 02:05:26,020
on UFO programs because there was an active Five Eyes nation

3252
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:28,820
that was working together on material exploitation

3253
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:29,660
and so forth.

3254
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:31,100
Well, there's a scientific principle

3255
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:32,900
called the Kiwanda effect

3256
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:36,780
and it involves stabilizing basically a saucer-like craft

3257
02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:39,540
and there's a, this guy, Henry Kiwanda was this guy,

3258
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:40,660
he's a Romanian scientist.

3259
02:05:40,660 --> 02:05:43,340
He has a patent on this from 1936

3260
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:45,500
and I think at points he was in Vichy, France,

3261
02:05:45,500 --> 02:05:47,820
but he basically was forced to work under the Nazis

3262
02:05:47,820 --> 02:05:49,900
and then he was taken to Wright-Patterson

3263
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:51,340
to work on Project Y,

3264
02:05:51,340 --> 02:05:53,560
which was an extension of the Avrocar project,

3265
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:56,700
which is trying to get flying saucers to work.

3266
02:05:56,700 --> 02:05:59,940
And so, and then William Steinman connects this

3267
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:03,380
with Thomas Townsend Brown and his gravity experiments

3268
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:06,300
where they were coordinating with Thomas Townsend Brown

3269
02:06:06,300 --> 02:06:08,180
and wanted to see if the gravity stuff worked

3270
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:10,140
so they could incorporate it into these saucers

3271
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:11,140
or whatever that they had.

3272
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:13,100
I wonder how much that collaboration takes place

3273
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:15,660
because you know, in Grush's News Nation interview,

3274
02:06:15,660 --> 02:06:17,980
he talks about like a multi-decade Cold War

3275
02:06:17,980 --> 02:06:21,180
with our adversaries we can assume is Russia and China.

3276
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:25,860
I think back to Jonathan Wagan's encounter in 97 in Peru.

3277
02:06:25,860 --> 02:06:26,900
Once he sees the UFO,

3278
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:29,260
he's taken in by these guys in DOE rain jackets.

3279
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:32,820
He's flown to a place on a CH-47, interrogated for days.

3280
02:06:32,820 --> 02:06:34,120
When he's brought to this location,

3281
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:36,900
this like obscure military base,

3282
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:39,260
there's not only Americans there, but there's Chinese,

3283
02:06:39,260 --> 02:06:40,780
there's Germans.

3284
02:06:40,780 --> 02:06:44,500
And so who else is collaborating on these projects

3285
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:45,780
if there's a multi-decade Cold War?

3286
02:06:45,780 --> 02:06:48,820
Well, that's the Lazar rumor as well,

3287
02:06:48,820 --> 02:06:51,300
which is that like Russians were at Area 51-2

3288
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:53,460
and there was sort of this co-space program.

3289
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:55,660
And that was always, there's, you know,

3290
02:06:55,660 --> 02:06:58,420
SALT, this is even public, this is open source.

3291
02:06:58,420 --> 02:07:02,520
In the SALT-1 negotiations, I think it was a 1971 treaty,

3292
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:05,020
we're talking about coordinating with the Russians

3293
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:07,580
on the UFO question because we were worried

3294
02:07:07,580 --> 02:07:09,980
that they'd mistake it for American acts of aggression.

3295
02:07:09,980 --> 02:07:12,620
That's what Kennedy probably wanted to do as well.

3296
02:07:12,620 --> 02:07:15,460
So maybe there is some sort of international space program

3297
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:17,760
around the UFO thing, I don't know.

3298
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:19,880
Yeah, and then we look at, you know,

3299
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:21,580
of course there's a lot of drama about this,

3300
02:07:21,580 --> 02:07:23,640
but the Immaculate Constellation Report

3301
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:25,840
that talks about alien reproduction vehicles

3302
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:27,080
seen over Indo-PACCOM,

3303
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:29,240
which is obviously Chinese territory,

3304
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:31,240
like equilateral triangles with three lights

3305
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:34,720
seen over Chinese territory of adversarial ARV.

3306
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:37,320
So it's like clear, there's similar programs going on

3307
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:38,980
if we have similar triangles,

3308
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:40,820
what sort of collaboration is occurring?

3309
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:43,780
It feels hard for me to believe that like

3310
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:47,560
the surface level geopolitics that we see is totally fake.

3311
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:49,680
I do think we are, you know,

3312
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:52,160
tensions are at an all-time high with China.

3313
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:54,080
But it is interesting, I think in the Lazar account,

3314
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:56,220
it's like the Russians started to get kicked out

3315
02:07:56,220 --> 02:08:00,400
as tensions rose around the development of these ARVs.

3316
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:05,400
And so it brings up, it harkens back to this Carl Nell quote,

3317
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:08,520
Carl Nell, who was part of the UAP task force

3318
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:12,160
with David Grush, was also deputy CTO of Northrop Grumman

3319
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:15,360
and I believe was stationed at Wright-Patterson Airfield.

3320
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:16,840
Yeah, and he was also Army Futures Command.

3321
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:20,720
And he says there's this sub Rosa secret conflict,

3322
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:23,740
arms race going on between us and other countries

3323
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:25,200
that's been going on for decades.

3324
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:27,000
Yeah, for feudalistic dominance.

3325
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,400
So that begs the question,

3326
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:31,400
is the ultimate pursuit mastery of ARV?

3327
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:33,540
Because with ARV might not just be the vehicle,

3328
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:35,700
but it might be any sort of weapon or technology

3329
02:08:35,700 --> 02:08:37,560
that can be exploited as weaponry.

3330
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:39,600
Remember what Randy said when he was taken to crane

3331
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:41,980
that the technology was considered weaponry

3332
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:45,600
due to an electronic discharge during retrieval.

3333
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:50,040
Well, if you think about what the Manhattan project was,

3334
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:52,840
it was all about payload potency and magnitude.

3335
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:54,680
And it's like, how can you create a bigger bomb?

3336
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:55,680
And then at a certain point,

3337
02:08:55,680 --> 02:08:57,600
when you're at the Tsar Bomb level or whatever,

3338
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:01,500
you're at 80 megatons plus, it doesn't matter.

3339
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:02,940
That's too big for any target.

3340
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:04,160
You have tons of Tsar Bombs.

3341
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:07,320
It's like, it's game over for the world.

3342
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,440
At that point it becomes,

3343
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:11,380
the second Manhattan project becomes about payload delivery

3344
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:12,220
and it becomes like,

3345
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:15,320
who can deliver this payload faster and stealthier?

3346
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:18,360
It was ICBMs and then it was stealth fighters.

3347
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:21,960
And so it's a scary world.

3348
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:25,080
And I almost don't even love talking about UFOs

3349
02:09:25,080 --> 02:09:25,920
in this context,

3350
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:27,120
because I think it's the sacred,

3351
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:29,000
ontological, metaphysical thing,

3352
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:29,840
which should really drive people.

3353
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:31,400
I'm talking about weapons.

3354
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:34,080
But I do think that that might be a reality

3355
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:35,200
driving some of this stuff.

3356
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:36,480
Yeah, and I completely agree.

3357
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:39,120
I think back to the 1988 Norton show as well,

3358
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:43,200
when Brad saw the pulsar craft with 121 nuclear warheads,

3359
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:46,560
the guys were raving on about how this could destroy Russia

3360
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:49,080
in like 20 minutes, raving on about that.

3361
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:50,400
Then on the other side of the curtain,

3362
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:53,400
you have saucers that utilize zero point energy systems.

3363
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:55,800
That could drop a nuclear payload

3364
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:57,220
in a quarter of a second,

3365
02:09:57,220 --> 02:10:00,480
or the zero point energy systems can be harnessed

3366
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:02,780
to create more devastating effects

3367
02:10:02,780 --> 02:10:04,680
than even nuclear warheads.

3368
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:07,640
Given that, that this technology

3369
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:09,160
is probably a forcing function

3370
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:12,280
for extreme good or extreme evil.

3371
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:13,440
Think about nuclear fusion.

3372
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:17,000
It could destroy the world or it could save the world.

3373
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,200
That's what Ed, Witness Ed out of Edwards said,

3374
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:20,680
part of the reason he reached out to Greer

3375
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:22,280
is because zero point energy systems

3376
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:24,400
were being harnessed and repressed.

3377
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:25,240
Do you believe,

3378
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:27,440
because that is part of the Stephen Greer narrative,

3379
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:28,800
the lost century.

3380
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:31,440
I'm not convinced that,

3381
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:35,160
I believe that we displayed some local effects

3382
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:37,000
around over unity, free energy,

3383
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,100
lower energy, nuclear reaction, whatever.

3384
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:42,500
But the idea that we have scalable free energy

3385
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:45,340
that we're hiding in black compartments

3386
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:46,460
feels hard for me to believe,

3387
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:47,660
but I'm open.

3388
02:10:47,660 --> 02:10:48,500
What do you think?

3389
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:50,980
I'm not sure because I don't understand the physics enough.

3390
02:10:50,980 --> 02:10:51,820
Yeah, I don't either.

3391
02:10:51,820 --> 02:10:53,540
There's always a world in which these energy systems

3392
02:10:53,540 --> 02:10:55,620
could be powering deep underground military bases

3393
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:56,860
and we just don't know about it,

3394
02:10:56,860 --> 02:10:58,660
that it's already employed on the system at large.

3395
02:10:58,660 --> 02:11:02,340
But my knowledge is we need to call it Missile Man

3396
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:04,780
and ask him his advice on this part

3397
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:06,480
because I just don't know enough.

3398
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:08,580
Yeah, yeah, no, totally.

3399
02:11:08,580 --> 02:11:11,660
I can't say I'm a high conviction in any direction there.

3400
02:11:11,660 --> 02:11:12,860
But how do you,

3401
02:11:12,860 --> 02:11:13,860
what's the thrust,

3402
02:11:13,860 --> 02:11:15,500
what's the motivation for your research?

3403
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:16,940
Is it just truth seeking?

3404
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:20,100
Or do you have a hope for how this UFO thing ends?

3405
02:11:20,100 --> 02:11:22,580
Because it seems like we've crossed a Rubicon of late

3406
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:24,980
as far as people's acceptance of these things.

3407
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:27,140
Yeah, but not enough.

3408
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:29,820
I've just been interested in this subject all of my life

3409
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:33,540
and my goal really is just the work.

3410
02:11:33,540 --> 02:11:36,940
I would like to, in a responsible manner,

3411
02:11:36,940 --> 02:11:40,300
help disclose UAP legacy programs

3412
02:11:40,300 --> 02:11:44,540
and bring a larger truth about what the craft are,

3413
02:11:44,540 --> 02:11:47,340
what, not just what they look like,

3414
02:11:47,340 --> 02:11:51,900
but where they're from, what they do, why they're here,

3415
02:11:51,900 --> 02:11:54,100
and how the programs that study

3416
02:11:54,100 --> 02:11:56,260
and exploit these technologies have been constructed

3417
02:11:56,260 --> 02:11:59,060
because there's a lot of very dark things in that aspect.

3418
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:00,980
Not only just the decades of secrecy,

3419
02:12:00,980 --> 02:12:05,740
but also just the exploitation of possible sentient beings

3420
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:08,500
and technology that is not ours.

3421
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:11,140
And exploitation of humans?

3422
02:12:11,140 --> 02:12:14,700
Yeah, that's the contentious thing we talked about as well

3423
02:12:14,700 --> 02:12:19,660
with Jake and Michael in that testimony with the psionics

3424
02:12:19,660 --> 02:12:22,740
because we have historical testimony

3425
02:12:22,740 --> 02:12:25,460
that these psionic assets used to summon craft

3426
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:29,540
are treated like crap,

3427
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:32,540
given drug cocktails and so forth to perform efficiently

3428
02:12:32,540 --> 02:12:34,220
and that could result in danger or death.

3429
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:36,020
And we also have Jake and the psionics team

3430
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:39,140
saying they take quite a bit of pride in those actions.

3431
02:12:39,140 --> 02:12:40,740
So there's a discrepancy there

3432
02:12:40,740 --> 02:12:42,580
that there's people being hurt

3433
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:44,860
or being given drugs forcibly.

3434
02:12:44,860 --> 02:12:46,740
That's bad.

3435
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:47,660
It's very bad.

3436
02:12:47,660 --> 02:12:48,700
It's definitely bad.

3437
02:12:48,700 --> 02:12:50,740
Yeah, it's not cool.

3438
02:12:50,740 --> 02:12:51,780
And then the idea too,

3439
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:55,540
where I don't feel like I have probably the most concrete

3440
02:12:55,540 --> 02:12:57,180
and good orientation towards this

3441
02:12:57,180 --> 02:12:58,660
and it's something I struggle with

3442
02:12:58,660 --> 02:13:00,780
because it's like you cover some of this stuff

3443
02:13:00,780 --> 02:13:03,140
and it just leads you into dark territory.

3444
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:05,500
And it leads you into the territory of like,

3445
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:08,580
yeah, I want people to know that reality

3446
02:13:08,580 --> 02:13:11,620
is more expanded than we realize.

3447
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:12,940
But the only way to do that

3448
02:13:12,940 --> 02:13:16,980
is to uncover some pretty gnarly messed up truths

3449
02:13:16,980 --> 02:13:19,980
around how this stuff has become operationalized.

3450
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:21,820
And the government's orientation towards this

3451
02:13:21,820 --> 02:13:25,660
is how can this confer a tactical advantage for us?

3452
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:27,940
And I think the orientation should be,

3453
02:13:27,940 --> 02:13:30,980
how can this beget more meaning for people

3454
02:13:31,020 --> 02:13:33,540
in civil side infrastructure updates?

3455
02:13:33,540 --> 02:13:34,380
And then great,

3456
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:36,820
if there are derivative technologies

3457
02:13:36,820 --> 02:13:39,060
that allow us to protect the free world

3458
02:13:39,060 --> 02:13:41,020
in a more effective way, of course,

3459
02:13:41,020 --> 02:13:43,380
they should be funneled to like the right thing.

3460
02:13:43,380 --> 02:13:45,060
But it feels like the impetus,

3461
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:48,740
like the sole impetus is weaponization of this stuff.

3462
02:13:48,740 --> 02:13:50,820
And I don't think that ends well

3463
02:13:50,820 --> 02:13:53,100
if there's an intelligence on the other side of it,

3464
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:54,260
which I think there is,

3465
02:13:54,260 --> 02:13:56,100
I don't think that ends well for us.

3466
02:13:56,100 --> 02:14:00,060
If that continues to be our orientation towards this topic,

3467
02:14:00,060 --> 02:14:02,780
we're dealing with forces way greater than us.

3468
02:14:02,780 --> 02:14:04,980
And I don't think it's a coincidence

3469
02:14:04,980 --> 02:14:08,900
that ASAP and a lot of these programs,

3470
02:14:08,900 --> 02:14:10,820
the people come out and they're kind of haunted.

3471
02:14:10,820 --> 02:14:12,860
They have these hitchhiker effects.

3472
02:14:12,860 --> 02:14:14,220
I think it's sort of,

3473
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:17,740
the two sort of mantras in UFO research world

3474
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:19,700
are like seek and ye shall find

3475
02:14:19,700 --> 02:14:21,140
and fuck around and find out.

3476
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:23,220
Look into the, stare into the void and it stares back.

3477
02:14:23,220 --> 02:14:24,140
Stares right back.

3478
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:25,580
And it's a mirror of what you feel.

3479
02:14:25,580 --> 02:14:27,460
And people, the description of the sphere,

3480
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:32,460
often when people are looking for the psionic connection

3481
02:14:32,540 --> 02:14:35,180
between less participant and these materials,

3482
02:14:35,180 --> 02:14:38,140
they're often, what's inside of them gets excavated

3483
02:14:38,140 --> 02:14:40,140
and mirrored in this technology.

3484
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:42,020
I mean, it's almost, it's also very poignant

3485
02:14:42,020 --> 02:14:44,620
like looking at the testimony of Corso as well.

3486
02:14:44,620 --> 02:14:47,620
He said that the purpose of giving this technology

3487
02:14:47,620 --> 02:14:51,460
to US industry was A, to bolster the US war machine

3488
02:14:51,460 --> 02:14:53,660
and B, benefit the American people if necessary.

3489
02:14:53,660 --> 02:14:55,980
These technologies clearly have not been used

3490
02:14:55,980 --> 02:14:58,300
to benefit the American people.

3491
02:14:58,300 --> 02:15:01,260
But if they're used to create alien reproduction vehicles,

3492
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:02,220
which I believe they are,

3493
02:15:02,220 --> 02:15:05,420
and possibly service an unidentified space program

3494
02:15:05,420 --> 02:15:09,220
or in near earth orbit defense capabilities

3495
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:13,780
or payload delivery or human relocation as Michael saw

3496
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:17,060
with the large football field sized eight gun craft

3497
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:19,940
or operate underground and deep underground military bases.

3498
02:15:19,940 --> 02:15:21,940
It's clear that that's a very disturbing reality

3499
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:22,940
in which we live.

3500
02:15:22,940 --> 02:15:24,580
Because that's 80 years of programs, right?

3501
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:27,380
Have had time to flourish and hide themselves

3502
02:15:27,380 --> 02:15:28,940
and like layer on themselves.

3503
02:15:29,860 --> 02:15:31,340
That's a very frightening world.

3504
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:32,580
It is a very frightening world.

3505
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:37,580
I just retweeted Scott Adams, the Dilbert creator

3506
02:15:37,580 --> 02:15:41,300
and he said, wherever there is complexity, there is fraud.

3507
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:42,820
And I just thought that was so applicable

3508
02:15:42,820 --> 02:15:43,820
to the UFO question.

3509
02:15:43,820 --> 02:15:46,100
There is an absurd amount of complexity

3510
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:49,340
to the point where disclosure has taken a quantum leap

3511
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:52,020
around this Jake Barber story and some of the other stories

3512
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:55,820
and like mainstream media could not give less of a shit.

3513
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:56,660
They don't understand.

3514
02:15:56,660 --> 02:15:58,980
It was horrible timing around the inauguration,

3515
02:15:58,980 --> 02:16:01,460
like peak news mania.

3516
02:16:01,460 --> 02:16:03,660
And then that's when you release this thing

3517
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:05,060
that's beyond the pale for most people

3518
02:16:05,060 --> 02:16:08,420
and you're piecemealing in psionics

3519
02:16:08,420 --> 02:16:09,820
and all these other things.

3520
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:12,740
And I love Ross Coulter.

3521
02:16:12,740 --> 02:16:15,260
I think he's an amazing investigative reporter.

3522
02:16:15,260 --> 02:16:17,700
And I think Jake is beyond reproach as well.

3523
02:16:17,700 --> 02:16:19,100
So it's not a knock on either of them.

3524
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:20,900
It's a knock on the timing

3525
02:16:20,900 --> 02:16:23,660
and maybe NewsNation's editing team.

3526
02:16:23,660 --> 02:16:25,700
Yeah, for the 45 minute special,

3527
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:28,300
that had to be like on the editing team.

3528
02:16:28,300 --> 02:16:29,380
That was not good.

3529
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:31,420
And then everybody started, it started to be vindicated

3530
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:33,580
when Ross did this amazing follow-up with Jake.

3531
02:16:33,580 --> 02:16:36,180
Yeah, the two hour, 47 minute.

3532
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:38,540
And then with, of course, I thought one of the most

3533
02:16:38,540 --> 02:16:41,020
underappreciated testimonies was Don Paul Bales as well.

3534
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:41,860
Oh yeah.

3535
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:42,680
Works closely with Jake.

3536
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:44,340
He talked very poignantly on retrieval

3537
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:46,180
and implications of crash retrieval.

3538
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:48,940
And so that started to kind of refocus the conversation

3539
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:51,420
with that, with Fred Baker, with Dr. John Blitch.

3540
02:16:51,420 --> 02:16:52,260
Yep.

3541
02:16:52,260 --> 02:16:53,080
Yeah, you're right.

3542
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:54,940
Mainstream media could not care less.

3543
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:55,820
It can care less.

3544
02:16:55,820 --> 02:17:00,420
And it's wild to see realities just diverge so starkly

3545
02:17:00,420 --> 02:17:02,340
where it's like UFO world is on,

3546
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:04,140
it's on another planet, literally.

3547
02:17:04,140 --> 02:17:05,780
And then there's also a big pickup

3548
02:17:05,780 --> 02:17:08,460
in social media categories of kind of discrediting

3549
02:17:08,460 --> 02:17:11,100
all the stories coming out and whistleblowers so forth.

3550
02:17:11,100 --> 02:17:14,100
Like I've even noticed a larger concentration of revisiting

3551
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:16,140
and kind of discrediting Grush as well,

3552
02:17:16,140 --> 02:17:18,300
who I find beyond reproach

3553
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:19,580
probably more than anybody else.

3554
02:17:19,580 --> 02:17:22,980
Yeah, dude, that guy is like motivated by the right stuff.

3555
02:17:22,980 --> 02:17:23,820
Yeah.

3556
02:17:23,820 --> 02:17:25,220
He's pieced together so much.

3557
02:17:25,220 --> 02:17:26,060
Yeah.

3558
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:27,500
And he's been treated like shit.

3559
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:29,900
And I think his disclosure was done in the,

3560
02:17:29,900 --> 02:17:34,020
his disclosures were done in the greatest manner possible

3561
02:17:34,020 --> 02:17:35,300
where if you have disclosures

3562
02:17:35,300 --> 02:17:37,700
but can't necessarily provide firsthand evidence,

3563
02:17:37,700 --> 02:17:40,500
he provided so much actionable intelligence.

3564
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:41,340
Yes.

3565
02:17:41,340 --> 02:17:44,620
Whether to pursue IRAD contracts, IDIQ contracts,

3566
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:47,020
embedding of programs, history of programs,

3567
02:17:47,020 --> 02:17:48,860
certain retrieval incidents,

3568
02:17:48,860 --> 02:17:50,420
mounds from Air Force Base incidents,

3569
02:17:50,420 --> 02:17:52,700
he provided so much actionable intelligence.

3570
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:56,300
Hundreds of documents, I think maybe a thousand pages plus

3571
02:17:56,300 --> 02:17:59,100
to the IC Inspector General, Thomas Meinheim,

3572
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:02,420
who's now out and they haven't done anything about it.

3573
02:18:02,420 --> 02:18:03,260
No, nothing.

3574
02:18:03,260 --> 02:18:05,140
And unless you can look at those documents,

3575
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:06,780
and all we have is that,

3576
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:09,180
Thomas Meinheim said it was urgent and credible,

3577
02:18:09,180 --> 02:18:12,020
and nobody has debunked anything in those documents.

3578
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:15,060
So unless you can debunk stuff in those documents,

3579
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:18,460
then you need to take action on what this guy is saying.

3580
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:19,620
It's absurd.

3581
02:18:19,620 --> 02:18:21,660
The only knocks people have against Grush

3582
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:23,660
is the Ken Clipstein hit piece,

3583
02:18:23,660 --> 02:18:25,660
or the fact his op-ed didn't come out.

3584
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:27,180
Where Ken Clipstein,

3585
02:18:27,180 --> 02:18:29,660
basically, Klippenstein,

3586
02:18:29,660 --> 02:18:33,340
he admitted to Cigar and Crystal,

3587
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:36,540
Crystal and Cigar, the breaking points.

3588
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:37,380
Yeah.

3589
02:18:37,380 --> 02:18:40,860
He admitted that the DOD and IC

3590
02:18:40,860 --> 02:18:43,220
tipped him off on the story, basically.

3591
02:18:43,220 --> 02:18:44,060
Yeah.

3592
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:45,740
It's just crazy.

3593
02:18:45,740 --> 02:18:48,780
And then the USAID, we now know,

3594
02:18:48,780 --> 02:18:50,140
was funding the Intercept.

3595
02:18:50,140 --> 02:18:51,860
I don't know how much of that specifically

3596
02:18:51,860 --> 02:18:53,500
made its way to Ken Clipstein,

3597
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:58,100
but the dude has all these secret sources from the USAID.

3598
02:18:58,100 --> 02:18:59,980
So he's a bad faith actor, I'm sorry.

3599
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:00,820
Yeah, absolutely.

3600
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:03,300
And I made a tweet to that effect,

3601
02:19:03,300 --> 02:19:05,780
and somebody threatened to sue me,

3602
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:06,740
and I'm not gonna say their name,

3603
02:19:06,740 --> 02:19:07,820
because I don't wanna amplify them.

3604
02:19:07,820 --> 02:19:10,260
They're really bad actors.

3605
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:13,380
And they've also questioned the service records

3606
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:15,340
of Randy Anderson and Jake Barber,

3607
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:18,060
which is just, I think, disgusting, to be honest.

3608
02:19:18,060 --> 02:19:19,300
Don't go after that.

3609
02:19:19,300 --> 02:19:20,740
There was a lot of talk about

3610
02:19:20,740 --> 02:19:22,180
the combat controller pipeline,

3611
02:19:22,180 --> 02:19:24,860
even though Jake has said numerous times

3612
02:19:24,860 --> 02:19:26,820
he was in the pipeline for combat controller,

3613
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:28,220
but then was diverted elsewhere.

3614
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:29,540
These guys just,

3615
02:19:29,540 --> 02:19:31,980
and one of them specifically has a clearance,

3616
02:19:31,980 --> 02:19:33,900
and it's like, I don't know what he's up to.

3617
02:19:33,900 --> 02:19:34,860
I don't know if he's a bad,

3618
02:19:34,860 --> 02:19:37,340
I don't know if he's actually acting

3619
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:39,900
he wants to be a paid disinfo agent,

3620
02:19:39,900 --> 02:19:41,380
but he hasn't gotten the contract yet,

3621
02:19:41,380 --> 02:19:43,340
and he's actually just this small-time guy.

3622
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:44,700
I think part of this is, as well,

3623
02:19:44,700 --> 02:19:46,900
there's some popularity to go against

3624
02:19:46,900 --> 02:19:48,700
kind of the disclosure movement,

3625
02:19:48,700 --> 02:19:52,260
and there's a couple prominent channels

3626
02:19:52,260 --> 02:19:56,420
that really base their entire fame

3627
02:19:56,420 --> 02:19:57,980
off of just debunking everything,

3628
02:19:57,980 --> 02:19:59,580
almost pre-debunking stuff.

3629
02:19:59,580 --> 02:20:02,740
Like a teaser of Jake Barber would come out,

3630
02:20:02,740 --> 02:20:05,620
and they'd already be debunking stuff.

3631
02:20:05,620 --> 02:20:08,700
Yeah, totally, and they don't listen to any of the details,

3632
02:20:08,700 --> 02:20:10,300
and their priors are entirely off,

3633
02:20:10,300 --> 02:20:11,900
because they take nothing seriously.

3634
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:15,620
So their Occam's razor is it's all mass hysteria,

3635
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:17,540
which if you look at the levels of government

3636
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:19,980
that are now saying that this is real,

3637
02:20:19,980 --> 02:20:20,820
your Occam's razor,

3638
02:20:20,820 --> 02:20:23,780
this is like a cabal controlling all these people.

3639
02:20:23,780 --> 02:20:26,540
It's the greatest mass hysteria in the history of,

3640
02:20:26,540 --> 02:20:30,140
it's the best PSYOP in the world by standard deviations,

3641
02:20:30,140 --> 02:20:31,060
if that's your claim,

3642
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:33,980
which is itself a fantastical null hypothesis.

3643
02:20:33,980 --> 02:20:36,980
So these people are, they suck, honestly.

3644
02:20:36,980 --> 02:20:38,420
The cabal stuff is nonsense,

3645
02:20:38,420 --> 02:20:41,220
because it's all talked about in the frame of ATIP and OSAP,

3646
02:20:41,220 --> 02:20:42,860
which as we've talked about

3647
02:20:42,860 --> 02:20:44,580
throughout this whole conversation,

3648
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:47,020
there's going back to Robert Zarbacher in 1950,

3649
02:20:47,020 --> 02:20:49,340
and even before in 1933 with Mussolini,

3650
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:51,460
there are so many other players involved.

3651
02:20:51,460 --> 02:20:55,260
There is not, there might be a lot of reoccurring players

3652
02:20:55,260 --> 02:20:57,500
that we've also talked about as well in recent disclosures,

3653
02:20:57,500 --> 02:20:58,860
but the circular reporting,

3654
02:20:58,860 --> 02:21:00,740
it's crash retrieval and reverse engineering

3655
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:02,980
is not isolated to a small group of people.

3656
02:21:02,980 --> 02:21:04,300
No, it's not at all.

3657
02:21:04,300 --> 02:21:07,300
If anything, the intelligence community tactic

3658
02:21:07,300 --> 02:21:10,620
to kind of repress this stuff has been flood the zone.

3659
02:21:10,620 --> 02:21:12,900
So there's too much snake oil to sift through

3660
02:21:12,900 --> 02:21:14,220
for the average person.

3661
02:21:14,220 --> 02:21:16,380
I think it moved from secrecy under Blue Book

3662
02:21:16,380 --> 02:21:18,860
in the 50s and 60s, and then the 80s at some point

3663
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:20,780
around the Majestic 12 stuff,

3664
02:21:20,780 --> 02:21:22,100
this stuff started to get promoted,

3665
02:21:22,100 --> 02:21:23,420
but with all sorts of quackery,

3666
02:21:23,420 --> 02:21:26,540
and you have Air Force Office of Special Investigations agent

3667
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:28,820
and other counter intel people like Rick Doty being like,

3668
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:30,300
there are six alien beings,

3669
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:31,860
and like John Lear saying,

3670
02:21:31,860 --> 02:21:34,140
there's a soul catcher on the moon or whatever.

3671
02:21:34,140 --> 02:21:35,420
And that's starting to pop back up

3672
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:36,940
with some of Rick Doty's disciples,

3673
02:21:37,580 --> 02:21:40,620
I think he's in prison, who tweets all the time,

3674
02:21:40,620 --> 02:21:42,540
like, let me show you a photo of an extraterrestrial

3675
02:21:42,540 --> 02:21:44,420
and it'll just be a random image.

3676
02:21:44,420 --> 02:21:45,380
Right, I don't know.

3677
02:21:45,380 --> 02:21:47,940
So that's starting to pop back up.

3678
02:21:47,940 --> 02:21:50,420
Yeah, so it's just, yeah, I don't know.

3679
02:21:50,420 --> 02:21:51,460
I'd love to,

3680
02:21:51,460 --> 02:21:55,940
because I think earnest debate is always good.

3681
02:21:55,940 --> 02:21:59,100
In McWest, people say he's like a paid asset or whatever.

3682
02:22:00,260 --> 02:22:02,500
I enjoyed having him on to debate Merrick,

3683
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:04,460
and we debated all the top UFO videos,

3684
02:22:04,460 --> 02:22:06,520
and I thought that was fun and good.

3685
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:09,760
He's like, I want more light shown on this.

3686
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:14,480
I think he could be a little more earnestly open

3687
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:15,480
to some of this stuff,

3688
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:18,840
but some of these other guys are just like bad vibes,

3689
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:21,440
and it's all ad hominem,

3690
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:25,480
and they threaten lawfare and stuff,

3691
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:26,400
and it's whack.

3692
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:29,240
It's like, I hope you, I don't know,

3693
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:31,640
just introspect a little bit if,

3694
02:22:31,640 --> 02:22:33,240
I mean, again, read between the lines,

3695
02:22:33,240 --> 02:22:35,000
see if this applies to you,

3696
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,360
because I don't wanna mention anybody,

3697
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:39,400
but it's like, just think about what you're doing.

3698
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:41,440
Are you really on the right side of history?

3699
02:22:41,440 --> 02:22:43,800
Well, also step back and study the subject a little more,

3700
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:45,640
because even if you're not ready to make the jump

3701
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:47,920
into crash retrievals and reverse engineering yet,

3702
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:49,800
go back, look at the history of Cyangrudge,

3703
02:22:49,800 --> 02:22:51,040
Blue Book, OSAP.

3704
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:54,440
Go look at numerous sightings, mass sightings.

3705
02:22:54,440 --> 02:22:58,760
Just go through a long list of UFO sightings

3706
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:01,840
and projects in the 20th century, and start there.

3707
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:04,040
I mean, there's the, not the Condon committee,

3708
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:06,640
but the Condon report from England,

3709
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:08,880
Project Magnet, Project Second Story,

3710
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:10,000
Grudge, Cyan, Blue Book,

3711
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,120
all sorts of UFO programs around the world.

3712
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:16,040
Numerous sightings, private corporations contracted

3713
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:18,200
to look at UFOs and Battelle.

3714
02:23:18,200 --> 02:23:20,400
Well, go watch your channel too, UAPGIRB,

3715
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:23,480
because it's, like I said, it's literally a fire hose.

3716
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:27,040
It's a cannon of absurd amounts of information

3717
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:28,920
to the point where you can't just dismiss it all.

3718
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:30,520
There's something going on.

3719
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:33,160
Even if that something is slightly adjacent

3720
02:23:33,160 --> 02:23:36,320
to the consensus truth we all think on aliens, UFOs,

3721
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:38,240
maybe the rest of the iceberg doesn't look like

3722
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:40,080
the tip of the iceberg, that's fine.

3723
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:42,680
I don't think anybody on the pro-UFO side

3724
02:23:42,680 --> 02:23:44,320
is dogmatic about that.

3725
02:23:44,320 --> 02:23:46,840
I think it's just, this stuff is worthy of investigation,

3726
02:23:46,840 --> 02:23:48,120
which clearly it is.

3727
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:49,760
And if you're still just trying to figure out,

3728
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:52,120
do UFOs exist, just go look at all the dang

3729
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:56,040
military reports of pilots and so forth, sighting UFOs.

3730
02:23:56,040 --> 02:23:59,520
Like the Malmstrom case, people dismissed that,

3731
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:00,760
but that's a great one to study.

3732
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:03,720
The Minot Air Force Base in which I think a C-1,

3733
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:06,760
sorry, a B-2 bomber encountered a saucer flying around

3734
02:24:06,760 --> 02:24:09,720
at de-elevating, there's so many stories.

3735
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:11,560
Just go read through the Blue Book files

3736
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:12,840
of the unexplained cases.

3737
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:16,640
Yeah, no, they're an enormous, and anybody

3738
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:20,160
in the government capacity looking at this sort of,

3739
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:22,360
earnestly, always comes to the same conclusion,

3740
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:24,480
which is there's something probably here.

3741
02:24:24,480 --> 02:24:27,520
Yeah, as Eric Davis says, there's a there there.

3742
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:28,520
Clearly.

3743
02:24:28,520 --> 02:24:31,720
Well, Sami, UAP Grubb, this has been an absolute honor.

3744
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:33,200
Is there anything else you wanted to cover?

3745
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:35,280
I mean, there are probably a hundred other things

3746
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:36,680
you could talk about, but.

3747
02:24:36,680 --> 02:24:38,120
Yeah, nothing really.

3748
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:39,880
There's so much stuff we could talk about.

3749
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:43,960
I just say to everybody, keep investigating

3750
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:45,440
crash retrievals and reverse engineering.

3751
02:24:45,440 --> 02:24:48,680
There's a ton of interesting cases and interesting studies

3752
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:51,400
and corporations and military requirements.

3753
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:54,280
And send out FOIA requests as well, a no answer

3754
02:24:54,280 --> 02:24:56,960
and a denial is always an answer within itself.

3755
02:24:56,960 --> 02:24:59,880
We didn't even get to that story of the whistleblower

3756
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:03,120
who talked about, was it an egg-shaped craft

3757
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:05,880
like off on the Azores, like off of Portugal?

3758
02:25:05,880 --> 02:25:09,480
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll save that

3759
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:11,680
because I plan to talk to that guy soon,

3760
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:14,800
but it's a person who was stationed with the USAF

3761
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:18,160
who claimed to see a Tic Tac.

3762
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:19,520
A Tic Tac, that's right.

3763
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:21,800
Unloaded from a C-130 Hercules.

3764
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:22,640
Yep.

3765
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:24,080
And there's a lot of good research there as well.

3766
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:26,320
That C-130s are often transport,

3767
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:27,680
what do you mean, good research?

3768
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:29,120
Oh, just that this incident?

3769
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:33,160
Yeah, because of course this guy, when I studied this case,

3770
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:37,480
he doesn't have photos or reports on the actual craft,

3771
02:25:37,480 --> 02:25:38,920
but the information he can share,

3772
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:42,000
which is like the insignia on the C-130

3773
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:43,600
and on the nearby vans.

3774
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:47,240
Just even just the C-130 that unloads the Tic Tac

3775
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:49,360
and knowing what military wing that's from

3776
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:52,760
can lead to such bountiful research

3777
02:25:52,760 --> 02:25:54,680
because then you can look where the C-130 is from,

3778
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:56,360
you can look at nearby contractors,

3779
02:25:56,360 --> 02:25:57,800
you can look at nearby air wings,

3780
02:25:57,800 --> 02:25:59,520
you can look at nearby FFRDCs

3781
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:01,720
and start to piece together some interesting stuff

3782
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:02,920
based off the testimony.

3783
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:03,760
I love it, man.

3784
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:05,680
Well, go subscribe to UAPGIRB.

3785
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:08,280
Check out, you're doing a follow-up with Randy Anderson.

3786
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:11,880
It'll probably be out or around out

3787
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:13,480
when we put this out.

3788
02:26:13,480 --> 02:26:16,080
And I know you're gonna do an amazing job there

3789
02:26:16,080 --> 02:26:18,840
and you're not only gonna talk to him,

3790
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:20,200
corroborate his story,

3791
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:23,200
but also, or try to stress test it, whatever,

3792
02:26:23,240 --> 02:26:28,240
but also go really deep into the specific contractor SAIC

3793
02:26:28,280 --> 02:26:30,560
which was likely involved in this sort of

3794
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:33,400
psychotronic or psionic research.

3795
02:26:33,400 --> 02:26:34,480
So yeah, it's been an honor, Sam.

3796
02:26:34,480 --> 02:26:36,320
We really appreciate you stopping by, man.

3797
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:37,400
Thanks for having me, man.

3798
02:26:37,400 --> 02:26:38,240
Yeah. Appreciate it.

3799
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:39,280
Absolutely.

3800
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:40,120
All right.
