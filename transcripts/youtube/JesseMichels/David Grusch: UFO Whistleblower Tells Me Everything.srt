1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Three men who previously served in the military are said to speak publicly about what they saw in the sky and heard behind closed doors.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All right, one more.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The guy in the white tan suit.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They have let in 15 people from the public.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There is David Grush, who's a former intelligence official.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He has knowledge of a covert government program to recover crashed alien spacecraft.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That is David Grush, a former Afghanistan combat veteran and 14-year high-ranking intelligence officer.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You're traveling light, man.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In 2019, he was tasked by the Pentagon to investigate UFOs as part of the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Task Force.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I had no interest in, you know, UFOs or whatever, but I thought it'd be kind of an interesting thing to see what was going on.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
During his investigation, Grush started to uncover a program that was being systematically hidden from him, the American public and our elected representatives.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We're done with the cover up and we're going to get to the bottom of it, dead gum it.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A program whose mandate was to find and retrieve crashed UFOs and attempt to rebuild them into functional vehicles that humans can fly.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And I'm sitting there and I'm like, OK, well, this is a thing.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thanks to new UFO whistleblower protections, Grush gave comprehensive documentation about these programs to the inspector general in the summer of 22.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He had brought people on the secret UFO programs directly to meet the inspector general's team and had even given the staff the names of the aerospace companies involved in these programs and the locations where the UFOs were ostensibly being kept.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I filed my complaint. I told them who the interview ends.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You know, they ultimately were like, holy shit, this is incredible.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In June of 23, he outed himself to the public, giving News Nation and the debrief exclusive interviews.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Do we have bodies? Do we have species?

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Naturally, when you recover something that's either landed or crashed, sometimes you encounter dead pilots.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Then in late July, he testified before Congress in Washington, D.C.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The hearing was a wild moment in history.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yup, there I am with a mark and deal from the second best YouTube channel online.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes, if you want instant inspiration and exposure to untold human stories across the world, throw them a subscription and stay tuned for their UFO documentary, including Dave coming soon.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I've known Dave for about two years when we were introduced by a mutual friend who had served on the Air Force with him.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And through many a phone call, he's put up with my wild speculations on the truth behind UFOs.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sometimes I'm like hanging up the phone to call me and I'm like, I don't know about this guy.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I think he's really using his grip.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
During the lead up to the hearing and in its aftermath, we were granted exclusive access.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let's bring it in.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We actually held the first and only public hearing with Dave and 20 young Yes Theory fans in Washington, D.C. after the congressional hearing.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We traveled with him, hiked the mountains of Colorado, got covered in dust on ATVs, hung out with some llamas.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What's the name of the llama?

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Playboy.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Playboy. I think the name of the llama was boy.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And of course, had a long form conversation.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We discussed the history of covert UFO research programs, their connection with Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project,

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
why presidents and elected officials may have been shielded from the UFO secrets in the past,

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and of course, his best theories as to how these UFOs fly, who their occupants are and why they're here.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
While you'll see a candid side of Dave that you've never seen before, he's still somewhat limited in what he can and can't say.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If anything slips that wasn't pre-approved by the Defense Department, he could literally go to jail.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But there's a lot of pretty insane new stuff he does say.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Manhattan Project, they were kind of the first blue book.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Do you think Bob Lazar is full of shit? Have we made any agreements with any of the aliens? You have a sense of, you know, the species?

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And if you combine our open source research with his revelations,

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
you can actually piece together a sort of coherent picture of what's going on with UFOs and human attempts to reverse engineer them.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Buckle up, I guess.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So without further ado, this is the atom bomb of American Alchemy episodes.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's been marinating for months and it was executed with Manhattan Project style secrecy.

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
All of the crew members weren't allowed to disclose what they were working on.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But I'm so excited that it's finally dropping and you are here to see it.

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So get your radiation goggles on, hit subscribe, and brace yourselves for a brain dump of everything you've ever wanted to know about UFOs

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
from today's American Alchemist, David Grush.

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hey, man. Hey, how's it going?

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Crazy day. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So what happened yesterday? I didn't read the news.

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
My name is David Charles Grush. I was an intelligence officer for 14 years.

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I was my agency's co-lead in unidentified anomalous phenomena and transmedium object analysis,

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:11,000
as well as reporting to the UAP Task Force, UAPTF, and eventually, once it was established, the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, AERO.

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Why were you placed on the UAPTF? And the UAPTF, for the people that don't know, is Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon Task Force.

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The UAP Task Force director funneled a request through the Ops Center like,

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hey, is there any intel officer for, you know, your agency would be willing to, you know, be a representative on the task force to kind of fill that void with expertise from NRO and the Air Force?

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And my boss got the email. He forwarded it to me and he's like, do you want to do this?

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And I thought, well, I'm a reservist. Like, I can put it on my performance report that I worked on like a task force.

68
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I thought it'd be kind of an interesting thing to see what was going on.

69
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
When did you start to realize that you weren't just kind of looking at, you know, anomalous phenomena and trying to classify it in the air,

70
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
but you were being sort of systematically lied to about an internal reverse engineering program within the government?

71
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, I mean, certainly going into it, I thought it was going to be, you know, air trash, some per se natural phenomenon.

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I remember sort of interviewing some military members that saw some really profound stuff like, you know, large, you know, triangular crafts, you know, football field size that they, you know, hovered over them.

73
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And I was like, whoa, you know, and these people were very serious, very upset to actually divulge that, you know, a personal thing.

74
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You know, it's nothing classified. It was a personal observation they had on a drive to work.

75
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And then, you know, one thing led to another. I had, you know, certain colleagues of mine that I'd known for years approach me, you know, close the door in my office and was like, look, you need to know about some other stuff you guys are not getting access to, you know, and kind of led down.

76
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why do you think they talked? Why do you think they spoke to you?

77
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I think a lot of these guys were, you know, they've kept the secret for so many years. They knew me. They knew what I was looking into.

78
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You know, we reported to the deputy secretary of defense in Congress at the time with the UAP task force.

79
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And I think they wanted some change. At least that's what they espoused to me is why do you think they want to change?

80
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You know, they felt that they were kind of limited in bringing people in, the support they were getting, their treatment was harsh sometimes, and I guess they weren't really feeling the love anymore.

81
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What's the first moment where you saw irrefutable evidence that what you're dealing with is truth, is reality?

82
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I mean, there were certain military cases, you know, we were analyzing that I just really couldn't explain in a prosaic fashion.

83
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What can you tell me about these craft? Why do you know it's exotic?

84
00:08:49,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Based on the very specific properties that I was briefed on, you know, isotopic ratios that would have to be engineered for it to be at those levels.

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And then, of course, you know, read some, you know, intel reports that were provided to me in that regard.

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And, you know, I took that and I went to the agencies that wrote those reports and asked for access.

87
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And when they deny you access, you know, it's a thing.

88
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And that's what happened to me time after time over a couple of years.

89
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So there wasn't a singular moment where you're like, just open the folder and you go, what the fuck is that?

90
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It was kind of like a slow burn culmination as I was processing it, you know, allowing my worldview to open.

91
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And yeah, I don't know if there was a singular moment.

92
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I think it was, you know, some of the really, really trusted high level people we talked to when they stared us straight in the face very seriously and confirmed a lot of this information.

93
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And the quality of people we talked to, if they ever go public, it'll blow your mind who we talked to.

94
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I was like, wow, I can't believe I'm talking to X, who's a really important person, and they're confirming these certain details.

95
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And they're saying like, you know, we need to protect us at all costs.

96
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And they're giving me kind of the whole speech about it.

97
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And I'm sitting there, it's like an out of body experience.

98
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm like, OK, well, this is a thing.

99
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't report to anybody and there is no plan.

100
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm not a part of some like slow drip disclosure or anything.

101
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If there is a plan, I'm totally unwitting.

102
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And holy shit, they've like controlled me in a very passive manner that is like master class.

103
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But yeah, I'm not a part of some weird shit.

104
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Did you ever at any point try to suss out whether you were being lied to?

105
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Because all of these people are coming from the same programs.

106
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And so presumably there's some level of coordination between them.

107
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So how do you kind of get through and just make sure that they're not meeting in some back room saying you say this to Dave, I'll say this to Dave.

108
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You know, for sure.

109
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So like I thought maybe it was like a joke or something.

110
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Maybe it was like a side up on me or something.

111
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't even know.

112
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then but the near 40 people we talked to, a lot of the guys I've known my entire career and like they wouldn't lie to me.

113
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I have like a friendship with them and for them to, you know, disclose to me that kind of stuff.

114
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And it ended up being a false.

115
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But it totally torpedoed the friendship.

116
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And I also went out of my way to find people who don't know each other either.

117
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And I had other higher ranking colleagues of mine go talk to other people that I didn't even personally talk to that group.

118
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Of course, we took all that.

119
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And I'm like all the people who conducted those interviews.

120
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I made them get interviewed by the inspector general because we're cross on our taste here because this shit is crazy.

121
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And I was you can never be perfect.

122
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But then I was so freaking careful to make sure I wasn't getting fed some bullshit.

123
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If they were in coordination together on a disinfo campaign, holy fuck, I shouldn't even be an intel officer because I should have sniffed that shit out.

124
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So in the last couple of years, have you had incidences that have caused you to be in fear for your life for addressing these issues?

125
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes, personally, there's a Chris Mellon story where he's supposed to meet with somebody on the program and he has the meeting all set up.

126
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And two weeks before the meeting, he says that the guy just randomly has a heart attack.

127
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We were about two weeks away from meeting when he died, when he had a heart attack.

128
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What was the last special access program that leaked? They don't generally leak.

129
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
People are like, oh, dude, wouldn't it be broadly leaked or whatever?

130
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm like, as somebody who is super cleared to a lot of that conventional stuff over the years, stuff never leaks.

131
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, it doesn't come out.

132
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
There are plenty of things that are pretty serious.

133
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
They're broad that have never seen the light of day.

134
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Of course, like you're going to tell someone that their entire life and their family and their kids, like everything is in danger.

135
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It doesn't feel too far fetched that someone will keep a secret if it if it if it.

136
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They're like, look, dude, you're not getting promoted.

137
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah, you're going to lose your job.

138
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The psychology of the typical career government worker rights, stable paycheck, pension, maintain clearance.

139
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So if any of that's threatened, you know, they're going to capitulate most cases.

140
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Right. The threatening nature of some of their indoctrinations where they're like, this is treason.

141
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You're going to Leavenworth. If you ever tell anybody not in the program.

142
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And oh, by the way, what's the penalty for treason? Oh, right.

143
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Execution. Right. And I was like, well, well, fuck it.

144
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll be the mouthpiece for you. I'll be the leader, I guess.

145
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I will shepherd you privately to the appropriate people that could be a recipient of your disclosure.

146
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You don't have to go public, but I'll do the thing.

147
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I mean, you know, it's not just me that, you know, has come forward, really, because I mean, Schumer, Rubio, all those guys are like, look, a bunch of freaking high level officers came to us and either they're crazy or the shit's real.

148
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Most of these people at some point, or maybe even currently have held very high appearances and high positions within our government.

149
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And then Schumer was compelled to write that big 64 page amendment that talks no shit, non-human tech, recoveries.

150
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And you're the majority leader who's tight with the president, putting out a law that will be signed here hopefully this fall that really puts the fucking executive in a bind.

151
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So I don't think that that was done in a vacuum.

152
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think the one thing that can get the left and the right together is bloat in the military industrial complex.

153
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Nobody likes that. I don't think members of Congress don't like getting the door shut on them either.

154
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So they want that information because they represent the constituency.

155
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And that was the Matt Gaetz story.

156
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Several months ago, my office received a protected disclosure from Eglin Air Force Base indicating that there was a UAP incident that required my attention.

157
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We were not afforded access to all of the flight crew.

158
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He was basically denied access to a crew that had seen kind of a diamond shaped formation of orbs.

159
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He should be fully clued into if it is terrestrial in origin because he's overseeing DARPA.

160
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He's on the Armed Services Committee.

161
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If you could just name anything, titles, programs, departments, regions.

162
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'd be happy to give you that in a closed environment.

163
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I can tell you specifically. Thank you.

164
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Maybe if we could get in a confidential area of SCIF, we could talk about that.

165
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But unfortunately, we were denied access to the SCIF.

166
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
A lot of the narrative for the whole thing was that you were denied a SCIF.

167
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What does SCIF stand for? Just for people.

168
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It was a specialized compartmented information facility.

169
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Which basically means that you guys would just get into a secure place where you can share.

170
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, that's a facility that's accredited to talk at the top secret sensitive compartmented information level.

171
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The members were pretty incensed that I believe it was like they couldn't reserve a SCIF

172
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and then they couldn't give me a one-time read-on back into the right accesses since I left the government.

173
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Do you have any sense of why that was denied?

174
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I don't know. I don't really have insight.

175
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It was something they mentioned to me. It was security or something denied it.

176
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
If you believe we have crashed craft, as stated earlier, do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft?

177
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
As I've stated publicly already in my News Nation interview, Biologics came with some of these recoveries, yeah.

178
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Were they, I guess, human or non-human biologics?

179
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Non-human and that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program.

180
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
One sort of bombshell sound bite from the hearing is Congresswoman Nancy Mace asked you about biologics.

181
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Ross Cuthart in the News Nation interview asked you about pilots coming out of these crafts.

182
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Do you want to just speak to that a little bit?

183
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah, I mean it is a mind-blowing side of it, right?

184
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's a little easy to imagine an artifact or whatever, but when you start talking about the biological side of it,

185
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
it really throws you for a loop psychologically.

186
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It did for me, and I talked to the people that were on that aspect of the program, if you will,

187
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and it comes with the territory. I mean, buckle up, I guess.

188
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I call them pilots because that's our vernacular. I don't know what their actual job was.

189
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Non-human intelligence, but they had bodies.

190
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah.

191
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Were they alive? Were they dead?

192
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't want to get into specifics. I know a lot of that stuff.

193
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Out of curiosity, why are you allowed to say that NHI pilots came out of the craft, but you can't know more?

194
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Well, that's all I put in the pre-publication stuff that got approved.

195
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Got it.

196
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I could go back and ask for more, but like I said earlier, man...

197
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Not your face, not your job.

198
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's a helpful context for the audience to realize that you literally have these contours with which you have to operate.

199
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Any specific knowledge I garnered when I was on the other side of the door, if I want to talk about that publicly,

200
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
everybody who has had a job like I have has to submit it to a thing called DOPSR at the Pentagon,

201
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
DoD Pre-Publication and Security Review, even if it's about this stuff.

202
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I know it sounds insane, but you literally have to say, this is what I want to talk about.

203
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Why do you think they approved it?

204
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Catch-22. So they'd have to self-identify and highlight their concerns to redact.

205
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So the office who would propose a redaction, say it's a three-letter agency or whatever, right?

206
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
They'd have to be like, this office objected to you saying crash retrievals, here we're citing the security classification guide.

207
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
No. And then you could litigate that, right, to get it unredacted if you think that's an inappropriate application of security.

208
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If it got redacted like that and it cited what organization and what security reason it is, I would just publish that.

209
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And then the public can make its own interpretation why the US government's withholding information about that kind of thing

210
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and wanted to sequester my speech. So it's a catch-22, honestly, for them. And damn if they do, damn if they don't.

211
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I just wanted to put enough out there, touch on all the most sensitive parts like the biologic side and things that really need to come out.

212
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But I don't want to overly disclose because it's not my job, but enough to put the flag out there that we need to elevate this.

213
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
This is serious. Some of the uncomfortable stuff, like the biologic stuff, like I mentioned during the hearing,

214
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,000
you've got to realize some baggage is coming with it besides the Indiana Jones warehouse thing that everybody thinks.

215
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Why do the politicians, why do the people who are higher up feel like they need to hide their evidence?

216
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Or I'm just like the root cause, why is this a topic that's so...

217
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah, I mean I can only know what the mindset was multiple decades ago. And anything in government, they're resistant to change.

218
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So this is the way we set it up. You remember trust in government was high back in the 40s post-war and then also society was less secular.

219
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So they're worried about the religious ontological shocks as well.

220
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And they never really developed a, we'll call it disclosure plan for what it's worth.

221
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And they just were like, this is the way it's been and we're going to keep it that way.

222
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And we don't want Russia and China to be exposed to any of this info and we don't want to give them an edge.

223
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And unfortunately, it's that kind of low energy thinking.

224
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If you got to ask one question to ask someone who is not alive anymore that you feel could answer a lot for you, who would you pick and what would the question be?

225
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I would probably ask Sarbacher, Oppenheimer and be like, what was your thought process in the 40s and 50s, you know, scrolling this away?

226
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I mean, besides overlaying the Manhattan Project secrecy, because Oppenheimer was the one who created the classification that included the UFO stuff.

227
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Oh, all those guys.

228
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The guys that were involved in Manhattan were overlaying the same ecosystem of secrecy and some of the same ways to protect stuff that they were protecting our nuclear secrets.

229
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:39,000
If you read the definition of special nuclear material in the Public Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it basically states any material that releases any kind of atomic energy.

230
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That would be retrieved crash material. So it's kind of a sneaky way.

231
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:53,000
No, it is. If you actually read the Atomic Energy Act, if something is not a nuke, but it has radiological energy coming off it, you know, alpha, beta decay, whatever.

232
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Same secrecy.

233
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Same secrecy.

234
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Until now, we haven't really had an exact understanding of the mechanisms of UFO secrecy.

235
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
We do get a few hints throughout history, though.

236
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:16,000
In 1947, in the aftermath of frequent UFO sightings across the United States, Nathan Twining, the head of all aircraft development for the Air Force, wrote a famous letter.

237
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
He writes that the UFO phenomena is something real and not visionary or fictitious.

238
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Everyone today focuses on this part of the now famous Twining memo, that top brass at the Air Force is conceding the reality of UFOs.

239
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But the far more interesting part of the letter is the postscript, where he writes about the possibility of American programs trying to build crafts with these capabilities.

240
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
He writes that,

241
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The Manhattan Project.

242
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Manhattan Project, they were kind of the first Blue Book.

243
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You know, they were getting UFO reports back in the day.

244
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,000
There were some people I'm colleagues with that, like, their grandparents were actually, you know, the UFO report people on the Manhattan Project.

245
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And I remember being told that. I'm like, really? Holy crap, that's crazy.

246
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You know, there's like a whole other side of the Manhattan Project.

247
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
This is a wild revelation.

248
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Blue Book was the Air Force's official program tasked with investigating UFOs in the 50s and 60s.

249
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But it was basically a propaganda mouthpiece for the Air Force, explaining a way and downplaying the phenomena for the public.

250
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Here, Dave is saying that there might have been a real deeper program than Blue Book studying UFOs at the time.

251
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And it was probably very tied in with the Manhattan Project.

252
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Legendary French UFO researcher Jacques Vallee told me the exact same thing.

253
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Project Blue Book was the best they could do at the time because they felt they had a real project going on that was secret.

254
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The Manhattan Project would have custody of it and then it would go into the Atomic Energy Commission.

255
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And then it would go into the Department of Energy, which has its own line of clearances.

256
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But where were these top secret UFO programs taking place?

257
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Well, the first hint we get might actually come from the quintessential UFO story, the Roswell crash in 1947.

258
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
As the story goes, in 1947, mysterious debris from a crash was retrieved by a rancher named Mack Brazil.

259
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
After collecting the wreckage, the Roswell Army Airfield issued a pretty insane press release, stating that a flying disc had been retrieved from a local ranch.

260
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But within 24 hours, the military announced that the saucer had actually just been weathered.

261
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Cut to 1978, Lieutenant Colonel Jesse Marcel said that this was all just a cover story to divert public attention away from the truth.

262
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
That the Roswell debris was extraterrestrial tech, which contained bizarre hieroglyphics and malleable memory metal.

263
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
According to him, the materials were eventually taken to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

264
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
This actually makes sense. Wright-Patt was the place that the military would take enemy equipment in order to reverse engineer it.

265
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,000
In fact, just a few years earlier, the base was used to successfully reverse engineer a German pulse jet engine.

266
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
When prominent elected government representatives would ask what was going on at Wright-Patterson, they would get shut down.

267
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It didn't matter who they were, senators, presidential candidates, even presidents.

268
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
If you didn't have a need to know, you were on the outside.

269
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I called Curtis LeMay and I said, General, I know we have a room at Wright-Patterson where you put all this secret stuff.

270
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Could I go in there? I've never heard him get mad, but he got madder than hell at me.

271
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Cussed me out, said, don't ever ask me that question.

272
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's like, well, what's going on? Why would General LeMay act like that to a sitting senator?

273
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So unless you're George H.W. Bush, Bush 41, who is director of the CIA, as the president of the United States, you probably don't even know.

274
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah, unless you've done the blood oath and you were the CIA director of something privately previously,

275
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
unless you have to stroke a pen, assign an executive order or something,

276
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:43,000
well, why would you have a need to know unless you literally, as the commander in chief, need to know it to make a decision?

277
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
What else was housed at Wright-Patterson?

278
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Well, it would become a nuclear engineering test facility and an anti-gravity research center.

279
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It also was the site for Blue Book, the anti-UFO SIOP that the Air Force ran in the 50s and 60s.

280
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So when you're running a secret UFO program, you have people working on the UFOs

281
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
and then you have people working on throwing the public off the trail and basically ensuring that they have no idea what you're doing.

282
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
The official Air Force reply has long been that there is no cover-up.

283
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You know, I've seen this other conventional programs. You compartment it so much.

284
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You know, some people don't know really what they're working on.

285
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Only the people that have the top level accesses can look down on all facets of the pyramid, as we say.

286
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And that hinders progress. And then certainly with this subject, when you're trying to crack an unknown-unknown,

287
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
that kind of obtuse security doesn't help either.

288
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
When you say unknown-unknown, you know, is it the USB drive to a caveman analogy

289
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
where it's like the caveman doesn't know information theory, doesn't have a computer to plug the USB drive into,

290
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and we just don't even know where to start in terms of reverse engineering things?

291
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Well, yeah, it's like other people have given analogies, like giving Galileo a TI-83 Plus graphing calculator.

292
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
They open it up and they see circuitry and they're like, well, what is even this? I don't have a concept of a transistor.

293
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But even that, or like a monkey with an iPhone, you kind of know how to...

294
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah, if you open it up, sure, you're confused, but you kind of know how to press the buttons

295
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
and you realize there's this graphical interface or whatever.

296
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That seems easier than caveman with a USB drive. So, like, where are we in that?

297
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah, I mean, some of it, it's hard to gauge how far in advance it is because you're just assuming a certain linear progression.

298
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You know, I think some of this is they made an asymptotal leap that, you know, put them over the edge to a different kind of plane of...

299
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
That's pretty fascinating, like a different timeline almost.

300
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
If I was a betting man, some of this NHI, they're similarly as advanced as us, but they've just made,

301
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
they've, what is it, asymmetric evolution or whatever, they want a different path where we made nuclear weapons and stuff.

302
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:07,000
They ended up making this like civil propulsion kind of equivalent discovery where they're able to do this now,

303
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
but they're actually not that much more advanced than you and I.

304
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I always found interesting, you know, sort of the monolith in 2001 Space Odyssey,

305
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
which is this sort of thing placed on Earth that it inspires tech innovation.

306
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It's almost like John Mack would talk about a lot of these alien sightings being slightly more advanced,

307
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
but barely comprehensible tech for the time, almost inspiring tech innovation.

308
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I often think of it as laying breadcrumbs in a direction.

309
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The communication could be you think you're really smart because you blew up a weapon down the road here.

310
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Now, you know, look at this.

311
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Right, right, right.

312
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Well, it's just like, you know, we went from, you look at our own human development, you know, we immediately,

313
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
once we cracked the atom, I mean, holy crap, nuclear power, nuclear weapons, you know, we went from, you know,

314
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,000
orders of magnitude of energy extraction, right, up to, you know, 10 to the 6 tons of TNT equivalent.

315
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And that's kind of what we're talking about is like we're like one, you know, discovery away to, you know,

316
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
maybe manipulate space time or whatever.

317
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Based off of the information that you've been privy to, is there any indication that these UAPs

318
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
are interested in our nuclear technology and capabilities?

319
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Yes.

320
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
By external observation, sure, that could be a fair assessment, yeah.

321
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes.

322
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
The nuclear UFO connection is deeper and more bizarre than you can ever imagine.

323
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Remember that Vice story that ran in 2022 about a town in Japan that's obsessed with UFOs?

324
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Well, it's a place called Eno, and it's right next to Fukushima where a 2011 earthquake triggered a famous

325
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
nuclear power meltdown.

326
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Or take this incident in 1994.

327
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
62 elementary school kids at the Aerial International School in Zimbabwe said that they saw a silver craft

328
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
descend from the sky and land on a field near their school.

329
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Well, guess where the Aerial School was?

330
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And, you know, an aerial school that was near a uranium mining site.

331
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That is right.

332
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
As far as I understand.

333
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But maybe the best collection of evidence around the UFO nuclear connection comes from a very creatively

334
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
named book called UFOs and Nukes by Robert Hastings.

335
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
He started to investigate and just speak to all these radar operators, and a lot of them claim some pretty crazy

336
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
things around seeing UFOs around nuclear bases.

337
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Over the past 37 years, I have personally located and interviewed more than 120 of these former or retired military

338
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
personnel.

339
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You have Robert Sallis at Malmstrom saying that the whole base was actually rendered inoperable.

340
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
This time he was screaming into the phone saying they're looking at an object, a red glowing object.

341
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Yeah, the sites were going down.

342
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Sites were going down.

343
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
One by one.

344
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Very rarely does a missile malfunction, and I don't think any much more rare would be two at the same time, but

345
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
never 10.

346
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
We have Bob Jacobs at Vandenberg in 64.

347
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
He's a photo instrumentation specialist.

348
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:21,000
They're launching dummy nuclear warheads off of Atlas V missiles and seeing a UFO kind of wrap around it and take it

349
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
down.

350
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And I said, it looks like we got a UFO.

351
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You have hundreds of accounts of these missile man radar operators at nuclear sites who have no incentive to lie.

352
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
In many cases, the incentive, or in all cases, the incentives split in the other direction saying that they're

353
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
seeing stuff.

354
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Well, now the missileers, you know, they're on what they call PRP, personal reliability program.

355
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Like they have to like report if they're like, you know, taking ibuprofen for God's sakes because, you know, they're a key

356
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
turner for nuclear weapons.

357
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
These missileers go through the most stringent of mental health exams to get their jobs.

358
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
They're literally the people we task with hitting the button that sends a nuke.

359
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
By definition, they are the picture of mental health, and they are all steeped in a culture that frowns upon attention seeking.

360
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Time and time again, these missile men would see UFOs near nuclear facilities and without fail, the Air Force Office of Special

361
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Investigations would show up men in black style, confiscate the footage, threaten the witness and swear them to secrecy.

362
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And he said, Lieutenant Jacobs, you are never to speak of this again.

363
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It never happened.

364
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,000
From Hastings work, we now know that UFO sightings were happening all across American nuclear production, missile storage and deployment sites.

365
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Plutonium enrichment sites like Hanford, Washington and Savannah River site in South Carolina.

366
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
To nuclear stockpiles at Fort Hood, Texas and Killing Base Camps.

367
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
From Los Alamos to Sandia to Malmstrom to F.E. Warren, the list goes on.

368
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
What is the connection with nuclear?

369
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Is it the kind of benevolent protector theory?

370
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
They don't want us to destroy ourselves or is it the some weird like they're mining us for something and so they want to protect their resources?

371
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Or is it the power unlock thing where we could rip space time and maybe be able to travel like they can travel?

372
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And so, you know, nuclear power is the axis along which we're making progress towards that.

373
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah, I mean, it might be as simple as like it's an attractant like a fly or a mosquito to a blue light, right?

374
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It could be something as simple as that.

375
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I mean, it's so hard because to put the put yourself in a different sentient shoes to understand intent and all that, I mean, could be probing.

376
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Could be reconnaissance, could be just, you know, mere curiosity.

377
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Yes, you know, oh, they're only, you know, two or three orders of magnitude away energy extraction from, you know, you know, manipulating space time and an occupier, you know, warp drive type thing.

378
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And maybe they're interested in that, too, to understand our our development as a civilization.

379
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I mean, without having, you know, a penetration into their OODA loop or whatever, we'll never really know.

380
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Yeah, it could be all the above.

381
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Yeah. And it's really impossible to really ever gauge intent.

382
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:18,000
The controller told us that these objects had been observed for over two weeks, coming down from over 80,000 feet, rapidly descending to 20,000 feet, hanging out for hours and then going straight back up.

383
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:28,000
For those who don't realize above 80,000 feet of space, it's just this cat and mouse sort of recursive unsolvability where it's just very hard to classify.

384
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's almost like playing with you a little bit.

385
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Even Commander David Fravor and his account was like the thing felt like it was like breathing and looking at me and knew even said you let it slip in the testimony.

386
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It was like it definitely was aware of our existence.

387
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm like, how do you know that, man?

388
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You're not in the UFO shoes.

389
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
But I understand what he was saying, which is you can sense when somebody's looking at you.

390
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah, I know.

391
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I've had some folks I talked to that had their own kind of up close kind of sightings.

392
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
They said that they got that vibe, too.

393
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And who knows if that's psychosomatic or what?

394
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But they did.

395
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
They did get a vibe like that, too.

396
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
When you stare into the abyss long enough, the abyss stares back.

397
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Yeah, exactly.

398
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And then, of course, I've had a very smart guy was like, well, did Darwin care to fully conceal himself?

399
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
When he studied the finches and it's like they observe, they don't really care.

400
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Right. And they don't really care to interact with.

401
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
They're just here to observe.

402
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But is that your bias that it's sort of an anthropological zoological model where they're like studying us and we're in this kind of dish?

403
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah, I think, you know, I'll give credit to Lou for the whole grill in the cage and, you know, throw out a banana for the key and see if it could unlock the cage.

404
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And maybe that's what's, you know, some of these, you know, crashes were.

405
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And it wasn't really a mission failure, if you will.

406
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It was, you know, maybe some seeding.

407
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
This is a total theoretical framework here.

408
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
We'll never really know.

409
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
See what you can do with it.

410
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Or the key is nuclear power or something.

411
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And it's like the gorilla has we have the key.

412
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Another analogy that Eric Weinstein loves to use is he talks about North Sentinel Island, which is an island of Aboriginals who basically have not made any contact with civilizations off the coast of India.

413
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And the Indian government basically just lets them do their thing and kind of respects them.

414
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And take this analogy, if the North Sentinelese started developing nukes, maybe the Indian government would start to pay a little more attention.

415
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:48,000
To the extent that there is interference, I think one anomaly that's important to talk about is it seems to be like there's a lot of electromagnetic radiation that comes off of these crafts.

416
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And I remember talking to Gary Nolan and he mentioned that he was kind of given a file by the CIA and he was tasked with looking into this.

417
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And it was two things.

418
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It was people who had anomalous UFO experiences and it was people who had experienced Havana syndrome.

419
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Diplomats and spies began to hear sounds and fall ill with a mysterious illness that people struggled to explain.

420
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
What became known as Havana syndrome.

421
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And in both cases you have these kind of severe electromagnetic radiation effects.

422
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And often differences in the caudate nucleus and patamen, which is in the basal ganglia, the dorsal striatum of the brain, the scarring.

423
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But also the neuronal density of that area of the brain would cause somebody to even make sort of contact.

424
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But do we have any theories on kind of the electromagnetic radiation component?

425
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I mean, certainly if we were to look at it from like a relativistic perspective.

426
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Well, that sounds like visible band light being blue shifted into the ultraviolet and you're getting literally a sunburn.

427
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And if you look at an occu-bear type thing where, you know, lights getting lensed around the craft, et cetera, stuff should be blue and red shifting.

428
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So things coming towards you would actually red shift spectrally.

429
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The people getting like burns. So that's ultraviolet. That's like ionizing radiation.

430
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So that would be light being blue shifted into the ultraviolet as it's lensed across the bubble that the craft creates.

431
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And so we are seeing artifacts that seem to show that it's they're basically manipulating space time.

432
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And I guess that's why you get this sort of skipping across time effect or something.

433
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It looks like the things are just you're sort of you're literally folding space time, I guess, so you can get from point A to point.

434
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You're riding a wave, basically create a wave and you're on top of the tsunami wave and you're riding across space time.

435
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And then, of course, there's kind of the other thing is, you know, if it's like an Einstein Rosenbridge thing, you know, two points on a piece of paper and you fold it.

436
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:11,000
But like but the way they're jumping around and skipping is if you're riding the wave, it looks like you're moving very rapidly and like punctuated kind of movements.

437
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Because if think of an accordion in those way, the waiver writings, the accordion when you flatten out the accordion like flat space time, you would smoothly move across.

438
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
But I think we're we're stuck with like Einstein stuff was amazing.

439
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And, you know, nobody's really I mean, there's obviously people with, you know, string theory and brain, all these other different physics theories, you know, quantum gravity and other theories.

440
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
But, you know, there hasn't been something that's, you know, unified all the weak and the strong force, et cetera.

441
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And that's an ongoing thing.

442
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And I think, you know, finding the Higgs boson is going to be the big answer.

443
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Yeah, we'll see.

444
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So speaking of string theory, it feels like it just hasn't shipped a product.

445
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You have our best and brightest often really smart people getting into this sort of field that, you know, maybe you can detect black holes with strings.

446
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But generally, it's just not that useful string theory.

447
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I mean, mathematically, you know, I get it works out right.

448
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:18,000
But like most of the stuff you can't empirically observe because the strings are so small and subatomically, there's just like no way of 11 dimensions and no way of verifying that.

449
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So it's a nice I'll call it like overlay or that that maybe this maybe this is reality.

450
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Maybe it's not. I think mathematically works out.

451
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I think it's force fitting GR, you know, general relativity and quantum field theory.

452
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,000
But this brings up an interesting question, which is can we go down the tree trunk of physics and then find another branch?

453
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Clearly quantum physics with nuclear and hydrogen bombs as its byproducts was becoming dangerous.

454
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It is an atomic bomb.

455
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe.

456
00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:05,000
After the invention of these apocalyptic weapons was true fundamental physics, then concealed in deep black aerospace while public facing physics was sent into a cul-de-sac so it could do less damage.

457
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Were there actually updates in physics, maybe mid century that were not disclosed to the public?

458
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Okay, I realize this sounds kind of insane, but hear me out.

459
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Imagine that this billiard ball is a proton.

460
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The Golden Age of Relativity was a wild forgotten time in the history of American physics.

461
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
This was a period in the 50s where the study of antigravity.

462
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Yeah, you heard me right.

463
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Antigravity experienced a dramatic resurgence of interest, not just among quacks among real physicists.

464
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Since then, there has been a steady but constant improvement.

465
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Roger Babson, a patron of science, was obsessed with finding the solution to antigravity.

466
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,000
His Gravity Research Foundation held a popular essay contest, which garnered contributions from many of the top minds at the time.

467
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Meanwhile, another industrialist, Agnew Bainson, started the Institute of Field Physics in North Carolina, also dedicated to the study of antigravity.

468
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:14,000
His Chapel Hill Conference in 1957 included top physicists like Bryce DeWitt, Richard Feynman, Peter Bergman, Freeman Dyson, and John Wheeler.

469
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
All there to discuss the role of gravity in physics.

470
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:25,000
As physicist Lewis Whitten would go on to say about antigravity in the 50s, it was in the wind, meaning it was everywhere.

471
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
He said, what are you doing about antigravity?

472
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And I said, well, I'm not against gravity.

473
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Whitten actually worked in Martin Corporation's antigravity research unit.

474
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
That's right. They had an antigravity research outfit.

475
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:51,000
It was called Research Institute for Advanced Studies, or RIAS for short, and Martin Corporation, of course, would later become Lockheed Martin.

476
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Lewis Whitten's direct boss at RIAS was a guy named George Trimble.

477
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
In a 1956 article found in Jane's Defense Weekly, George Trimble said,

478
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
we're already working on nuclear fuels and equipment to cancel out gravity,

479
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
and added that the conquest of gravity could be done in about the amount of time it took to build the first atom bomb.

480
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
By the time the 60s had rolled around, most people had kind of forgotten about antigravity.

481
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It quieted down because no one ever got anywhere, or it quieted down because it did get somewhere and it went black.

482
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Yeah, it is kind of weird where, as far as I know, in my kind of topological physics history knowledge,

483
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:38,000
where there was all these antigrav groups up until the early 60s, and then they totally vaporized.

484
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
You know that there's physics knowledge held by aerospace companies that is not known?

485
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
There certainly is materials knowledge.

486
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Materials? Well, okay, materials science.

487
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Which involves topological physics or whatever.

488
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It's hard to say whether anything real was discovered in the realm of antigravity or if it went black.

489
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But when aviation journalist Nick Cook tried to meet with the then long retired 80-something-year-old George Trimble

490
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
through a friend of his at Lockheed Martin, this was the message he received back.

491
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Quote unquote, I don't know who this old man is or what he once was,

492
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
but he told me in no uncertain terms to get off his case.

493
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
He doesn't want to speak to me and he doesn't want to speak to you.

494
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Not now, not ever.

495
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I don't mind telling you that he sounded scared.

496
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Did deep black aerospace secretly make a huge breakthrough in antigravity?

497
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Well, when he worked for Martin in the 50s, Lewis Whitten specialized in nonlinear algebra and topological physics,

498
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
the two things that you'd need to investigate gravity and maybe how to beat it.

499
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
He also did contract work on gravity for Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

500
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:52,000
The reason there was a laboratory at Wright Field was to find out what we were doing and to help us do it.

501
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And I got a contract from Wright Field to do it, to do gravity, which I did very happily.

502
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And who is Lewis Whitten's son? Ed Whitten.

503
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Just the most formidable proponent of string theory, maybe of all time.

504
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Do you think that string theory, which Ed Whitten worked on, is intentionally a bridge to nowhere?

505
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I have privately said to you that string theory was a very odd development

506
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
because it both allowed physics to proceed as if it was doing something new

507
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
while breaking no new ground in the physical world in which we live.

508
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I don't really know if you were trying to stagnate the field, but string theory is pretty brilliant.

509
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And remember that Chapel Hill Conference that's thrown in 1957 by Agnew Bainson, who's obsessed with antigravity?

510
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Well, Lewis Whitten was there, and the conference helped establish quantum gravity, of which string theory is an offshoot.

511
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
In an interview with the American Institute of Physics, when antigravity gets brought up,

512
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Lewis Whitten says, a guy named Townsend discovered that there was a type of bismuth that was repelled instead of attracting.

513
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
There was a vice president of the Martin Company who brought that up.

514
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
He said, I read about a guy in Indiana who says the rock of bismuth, that's it, shows antigravity.

515
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And where have we heard about bismuth with possible antigravity properties before?

516
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
That's Gary Nolan, Stanford microbiologist and Nobel nominee,

517
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,000
who claims to have UFO crash parts with isotope ratios that don't occur naturally on Earth.

518
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
One of his pieces that we looked at together when I visited was magnesium bismuth.

519
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Bismuth layers less than a human hair, supposedly picked up in the crash retrieval of an advanced aerospace vehicle.

520
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Nowhere could we find any evidence that anybody ever made one of these.

521
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And who's this Townsend guy Whitten's referring to?

522
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Whitten had to have been talking about Townsend Brown, one of the country's leading antigravity researchers at the time.

523
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Yeah, and there's a guy named Townsend Brown who had a theory that if you took two charged plates

524
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and then you put something neutral between them, the neutral thing would sort of gravitate a little towards the positively charged plate

525
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
and you could basically figure out antigravity.

526
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,000
From the outside, Townsend Brown sort of looks like an amateurish mid-century physicist and failed inventor

527
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:32,000
exploring the kooky world of antigravity just to end up failing and creating the intellectual property behind the ionic breeze air purifier.

528
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm not joking, but a great biography called The Man Who Mastered Gravity by Paul Shotskin tells the real story.

529
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:51,000
He parachuted behind enemy lines into Germany in 1944 and started looking into the German UFO reverse engineering program.

530
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
That's crazy.

531
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:04,000
OSS and MI6 super spies Bill Donovan and William Stevenson needed the Allies' preeminent antigravity scientists to investigate the notorious Foo Fighter phenomena.

532
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
These were bizarre orbs that looked like intelligently controlled ball lightning

533
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
popping up all over Germany in the early 40s and messing with Allied fighter pilots.

534
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I couldn't find a ton of corroboration outside of Shotskin's book on this story, but here's why I think it's true.

535
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,000
We do know for a fact that Eisenhower sent General James Doolittle to investigate Swedish ghost rockets.

536
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
These were tons of UFO sightings in Sweden and Finland in the immediate aftermath of World War II.

537
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Curiously, Doolittle then went back to the United States just to found the Lindbergh Foundation, which researched novel aviation propulsion methods.

538
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So I wouldn't be totally surprised if Townsend Brown was tasked with the same thing with Foo Fighters.

539
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I mean, there's some other stuff, too, that I can't talk about that was way before that, that you're like, oh, shit.

540
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
But what did Brown's work in antigravity have to do with UFOs?

541
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Well, his Gravitator looked exactly like a flying saucer.

542
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
He found that circular craft were better for that application than wing craft.

543
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And behind closed doors, Townsend Brown was obsessed with UFOs.

544
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
He even created NYCAP, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena.

545
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:28,000
When Townsend's daughter, Linda Brown, and his biographer requested the scientists records from the Navy, they were at first very uncooperative.

546
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
And then eventually they hinted that a lot of Brown's work was still classified.

547
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
But why would Brown's work be classified if he was just a failed hack?

548
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:47,000
The National Secrecy Act prevented scientists like T. Townsend Brown from commercializing or even publicizing any technology which could potentially be interpreted as having a military application.

549
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Well, we know from Shotskin's biography that Brown actually had meetings with the highest level officials in American atomic programs.

550
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:03,000
People like Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb, and General Curtis LeMay, both deep insiders when it came to atomic secrets.

551
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Townsend Brown's daughter, Linda, even recalls that he was often taken home in a black Cadillac driven by a man that she would eventually come to know as Robert Saarbacher.

552
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
And where have we heard that mysterious name before?

553
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Saarbacher, somebody purportedly involved in the standup of the stuff that I uncovered, right?

554
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
But if you look deeper, things get even weirder with Brown.

555
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:33,000
In the naval records that we do have, it shows that Brown was suddenly terminated by the Navy in 1942 with no explanation despite strong performance.

556
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Two weeks later, he mysteriously pops up as an employee at Martin Corporation in Burbank, just 50 miles from where Skunk Works is founded a year later by legendary aeronautical engineer Kelly Johnson.

557
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Skunk Works was created to house Martin's most advanced secretive work.

558
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Over 80% of its current projects are still classified.

559
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Is it a coincidence that Townsend Brown joined Martin Corporation a year before its founding?

560
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And guess who else funded Brown? None other than Agnew Bainson, the same anti-gravity financier who helped send physics into a dead end by popularizing quantum gravity.

561
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Okay, okay, Townsend Brown, remember that. I want to look that up. I've heard of him in one of the documentaries, I believe.

562
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Okay, this is all interesting, but I know, right? We don't have a smoking gun that any of Brown's work actually got implemented by Deep Black Aerospace.

563
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Well, that's actually not true. We kind of do have evidence.

564
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,000
In March of 1992, Aviation Week broke a story about the B2 stealth bomber.

565
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
It used an electrokinetic effect in its wings, producing a Bifield Brown effect.

566
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
The B2 surfs its own electrostatic wave, the negative cloud chasing the positive wing.

567
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:58,000
This is an exact description of Townsend Brown's work, and the Bifield Brown effect is literally named after him.

568
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:09,000
And the B2 was built by the merged Northrop Grumman, whose major investor, Floyd Odlam, was the same guy that invested in Townsend Brown's company, Guidance Technologies, in the 60s.

569
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I guess Townsend Brown isn't just the wacky fan guy anymore.

570
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:29,000
There's just like this parallel history. It's very tightly coupled to what is known publicly, paperclip, etc.

571
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
But there's this like other side of it that a lot of it dealt with the UFO, UIP issue in earnest.

572
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Operation Paperclip was a secret CIA program that took more than 1,600 former Nazi scientists and engineers

573
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:51,000
and placed them in senior leadership roles in American military, intelligence, and space programs in the wake of World War II.

574
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Germans made more progress than anybody at the time, just in aerospace generally. The B2 flying rocket was 20, 30 years ahead.

575
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
The ME262 jet fighter and the whole Wunderwaffe arsenal.

576
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And one has to ask, why do we have such a pressing need to get Werner von Braun and Arthur Rudolph and all these guys?

577
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
The NASA Saturn program was literally a transplantation of the Nazi program.

578
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Why was there such a pressing need to get all these people in the US?

579
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And maybe it had something to do with the UFO thing, who knows?

580
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Because Werner von Braun was also a very trippy guy.

581
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Remember that story about Townsend Braun parachuting into Germany to investigate food fighters and Nazi UFO programs?

582
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Well, maybe Operation Paperclip had a little more to do with UFOs than meets the eye.

583
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Yeah, Paperclip's pretty nuts when you think about it, like ethically and morally.

584
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
You had people that were war criminals or people who were going to be tried at Nuremberg.

585
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yes.

586
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
They took off that and then they snatched them and brought them back to the US.

587
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
And a lot of them became seniors of what became the CIA and NASA.

588
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
And it's like, yeah, I don't know if that would have happened nowadays.

589
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I feel like we would actually not be able to turn a blind eye to that.

590
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh, there's no chance.

591
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Werner von Braun oversaw a brutal, mostly Jewish slave labor camp where tons and tons of people died.

592
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And then he went on to literally run our space program.

593
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It's pretty interesting history.

594
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah, like his boss, like the German general that, you know,

595
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
von Braun worked for back in Germany, you know, came over and was like very high up and I think it was NASA.

596
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:39,000
After so many witnesses have seen the so-called flying saucers, their existence cannot longer be denied.

597
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
You know, it's kind of like getting red-pilled in The Matrix.

598
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,000
It's like, whoa, holy shit, reality is like way crazier and weirder than I thought.

599
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
There's more lucky people from the program watching your channel than ours.

600
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Maybe, maybe.

601
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I can tell you that for sure.

602
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
They're like, ah, this Jesse guy keeps making speculations.

603
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
He's coming closer and closer.

604
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Well, the thing is, if you have somebody who has a great intelligence on this,

605
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
you should probably bring them in and not, you know, leave them out there speculating, right?

606
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
If you're on the program, no, no, no.

607
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Mine's strictly the nightmare type.

608
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Reports of flying saucers are nothing new.

609
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,000
From the beginning of recorded time, men have been seeing unexplainable things in the sky.

610
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
One of you told me the other day about the saucer, the flying saucer.

611
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Someone said that word before it became in movies or something.

612
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

613
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And we had the public hearing with the Yes family that was brought up.

614
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Anyone want to?

615
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Yeah, Kenneth Arnold in 1947, two months before Roswell,

616
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
was looking for a downed cargo plane in Mount Rainier.

617
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
He saw this kind of saucer skipping or something like that.

618
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Saucer skipping.

619
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
It was they were in a flying V formation.

620
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
But yeah, I think the point of that was in culture,

621
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
the word flying saucer was not derived from fiction.

622
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It's the other way around.

623
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,000
It was like people's like our depiction of aliens and flying saucers were actually

624
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
were derived from people's real life stories, not the other way around.

625
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And that's always a misconception about.

626
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Yes, but this is an important conversation.

627
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I don't know if you have an opinion on this,

628
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,000
but books like American Cosmic by Diana Pasolka and Passport to Magonia by Jacques Ballet

629
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
do talk about how the noble mythology of the time, whether it's the religion or media,

630
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,000
do play somewhat of a role in sort of shading how you recollect and experience.

631
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
So the classic example is Betty and Barney Hill in 1961.

632
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Outer Limits was a CBS show that had played 11 days before that abduction experience.

633
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
And it showed aliens with eyes that wrapped around the rims of their head.

634
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And that's exactly what they sort of described.

635
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Yeah, analytical overlay.

636
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It's almost like we discussed before where you had like, you know,

637
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
witches sitting on the chests of people feeling paralyzed in medieval times.

638
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It's like, you know, our overlay is this classic alien kind of motif.

639
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
But like you look at what they said before, it's the same phenomenon.

640
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Basically, people, their analytical overlay is different.

641
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So they describe it in a different way.

642
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Right. Leprechauns, fairies, elves, angels, demons.

643
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
We just superimpose our own reality onto the thing.

644
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
It's almost like you have like a meme library in your head.

645
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And then you have this higher platonic thing that's happening

646
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
and you attach the closest meme that you can to it.

647
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Yeah, exactly.

648
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
People have been seeing the same stuff.

649
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
So the tic-tac of today was the flying butane tank of the 1950s.

650
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And you can find declassified Air Force OSI reports that are publicly searchable right now

651
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
that talk about these like flying white butane tanks.

652
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And you know, the Foo Fighters phenomenon in World War II.

653
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
And then if you were to go way back, you know,

654
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
you see stuff that's basically described the same in antiquity as well.

655
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
So whether it be extraterrestrial, I don't know, some other kind of origin,

656
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
you know, crypto-terrestrial, some of the other stuff people postulate,

657
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
we deserve to understand, you know, truths of the universe.

658
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
And if we have the answer one of life's questions, right, you know,

659
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
what happens when we die and are we alone, if we can answer one of those.

660
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
But it's kept in secret because they believe the public can't handle it

661
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
or it hinders this like, you know, Cold War arms race

662
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
that I talked about in my first public interview.

663
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
That seems pretty messed up to me.

664
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
What do you think about elite interest in the topic?

665
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
So the Rockefellers funded Stephen Greer in the 90s.

666
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And John Mack.

667
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And John Mack.

668
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And they funded the Princeton Parapsychology Lab.

669
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Then you have Chris Mellon, who's a Mellon, obviously sort of interested in the subject.

670
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I think there are letters between Lawrence Rockefeller and Hillary Clinton

671
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
in the 90s where he's sort of pushing for disclosure.

672
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
That's right, because I think was David Rockefeller also involved in that?

673
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
And it was like a Camp David meetup in the 90s.

674
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
And she's holding the book by Paul Davies, Are We Alone?

675
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And there's a photo of that and it's wild.

676
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Certainly, if you use the Rockefellers as the most prominent example,

677
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
they're certainly called old money elite interests.

678
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And maybe it's because of their interest in frontier science or who knows?

679
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I've never talked to the Rockefellers.

680
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I have no idea what spurred that interest on.

681
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
But they were certainly pushing for transparency on the issue.

682
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And that's one of the most influential families in America, right?

683
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,000
It is important in any scientific process to try to maintain the null hypothesis for as long as possible.

684
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:51,000
And actually, Kuhn, who wrote The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, talks about this.

685
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
And he was friends with John Mack, who was the head of the Harvard Psychiatry Department,

686
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
who tried to maintain a null hypothesis and say, I don't think this is real,

687
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
because he was actually a private clinician.

688
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
He started to see people who would bring up these alien encounters.

689
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And I think the thing that's really important for people is just the amount of credentialed people

690
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
that once they start to have an open mind and actually genuinely inquire,

691
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
usually these people start to take it seriously.

692
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I have a good friend, Eric Weinstein, who's a pretty well-respected public intellectual.

693
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I used to just wax poetic, look, this is real, I promise you this is real.

694
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And he used to think, I think his quote is like, this is the one area where you had brain damage.

695
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
You would not come off of this point.

696
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And I was convinced that you were brain damaged on this one issue.

697
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
No, I really was.

698
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And now, look, I think he oscillates, but he's pretty deep into the history,

699
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
to the point where he's bought in that this is at least something worthy of investigation.

700
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Yeah, I mean, there's certainly some scholarship there,

701
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
whether it be Jacques Vallee or Dina Pasulka recently.

702
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Jacques Vallee built the earliest version of the Internet, ARPANET, or he helped it,

703
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Doug Engelbart, and is a serious astronomer.

704
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
People have serious background.

705
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I was a really hardcore intel guy working on some of the hardest, most deep black stuff.

706
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And I didn't really think much about UFOs, but when I started looking into it,

707
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I have people in tears, naval officers, pilots, et cetera, wanting to tell me what they literally saw.

708
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
You know, and either a lot of people were having psychological breaks.

709
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,000
There's a lot of weird weather phenomena that manifest themselves in physical, tangible,

710
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
like metallic looking crafts that are close.

711
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
That seems crazy to me.

712
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And I'm like, well, these people deeply believe what they saw.

713
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And I have to take them seriously.

714
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So we need to figure out what this phenomenon is.

715
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Carl Jung wrote a book about flying saucers, and he talks about flying saucers as the kind of mandala,

716
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
the Sanskrit symbol of psychic completeness.

717
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And it's this proto-psychological desire for us to have this kind of revelation of knowing everything all at once.

718
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And what was crazy about it is he wrote the book, and he was like,

719
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
this is just kind of a symbolic psychological archetype.

720
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And then afterwards, he became convinced that the phenomena was actually real.

721
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
There are things flying around up there that we haven't fully identified yet.

722
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Roswell's a very interesting place with a lot of people that would like to know what's going on.

723
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:41,000
There's footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are.

724
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
We saw a bright light appear in the distant western skies.

725
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Okay, at this point in the video, you might be thinking there's actually a decent amount of evidence for UFOs.

726
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,000
So why are people so reflexively and often smugly dismissive of the topic?

727
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
No to predictions, no to aliens.

728
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Well, on the one hand, it's a fair reaction.

729
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
There are a multitude of profit and attention seeking charlatans in the space.

730
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,000
People who have absolutely no interest in pursuing truth, who embellish stories and sell snake oil for a living.

731
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Then, of course, you have your counterintelligence crew throwing constant smoke bombs

732
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
and trying to confuse you and throw you off the trail.

733
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
But maybe the most important point when discussing the insane stigma around UFOs

734
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
is that some of the biggest, most prominent skeptics over the last 50 years,

735
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
the people who've done more damage to open research on the topic than anyone else,

736
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
were, you guessed it, from the atomic programs.

737
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
The same atomic programs Dave is saying are responsible for initially studying UFOs

738
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
and then establishing their secrecy.

739
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Edward Euler Condon was a mid-century quantum physicist,

740
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
and no single person is more responsible for the marginalization of UFOs

741
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
than this man and his famous Condon committee.

742
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:29,000
This 1966 investigation into UFOs was paid for but supposed to be uninfluenced by the Air Force.

743
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:34,000
But we now know that Condon was actually coordinating closely with Air Force officials

744
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
like Colonel Robert Hippler, who had expressed clear written desire

745
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
that all previous UFO research be shown as a waste of money.

746
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:48,000
The Condon committee's report dealt a death blow to UFO research in the second half of the 20th century.

747
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
The backstory here is that Condon was very deep in the world of atomic secrets.

748
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Not only did he study with Robert Oppenheimer under Max Born in Germany together in the 20s,

749
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,000
he's sometimes credited for helping Oppenheimer pick Los Alamos as the site for the Manhattan Project.

750
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Condon knew the area well, having grown up around the corner in Alamogordo.

751
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
He also recruited a lot of the project's early staff and wrote the Los Alamos Primer,

752
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
a document all employees had to read before arrival.

753
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Then in 1946, Condon helps draft the McMahon Atomic Energy Act,

754
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,000
which again Dave is literally saying establishes the framework for UFO secrecy.

755
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
The McMahon Act of 46, which was the predecessor to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.

756
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
The guys that were involved in Manhattan were overlaying the same ecosystem of secrecy

757
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,000
and some of the same ways to protect stuff that they were protecting on nuclear secrets.

758
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
So Condon was probably clued into high level UFO secrets from the start.

759
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
And how many people were deterred from studying UFOs because this one high prestige

760
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
quantum physicist told them it was a waste of time.

761
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So was Condon just an insider who knew the truth behind UFOs

762
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:04,000
and was he used by the original atomic UFO programs and by the Air Force to downplay it?

763
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Bob Lazar said he worked at a secret facility near Groom Lake

764
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
where alien technology was being reverse engineered.

765
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Do you think Bob Lazar is full of shit?

766
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Bob Lazar is by far the most famous case of somebody who publicly claims

767
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
to have secretly worked on reverse engineering UFOs.

768
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:30,000
He outed himself in 1989 and since then has remained remarkably consistent in his story.

769
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Even while detractors cite that he possibly faked his educational credentials at MIT.

770
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
He ended up actually recently going on Joe Rogan.

771
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
And it's still like this bizarre split where like so many people are like he was right.

772
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
He was right. And people are now using your testimony to say he's he's totally vindicated.

773
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And then the verdict's still out because I a lot of ufologists or UFO people

774
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
that I really respect are just pretty skeptical.

775
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
So I don't know if you have a take.

776
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I'm certainly different than him.

777
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I came at it from a different angle.

778
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I have no information on Bob Lazar.

779
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
It wasn't in the scope of my looking into it kind of activities.

780
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
If he actually ever experienced what he experienced, I literally have no idea.

781
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Honestly, I go back and forth on whether Bob Lazar is telling the truth all the time.

782
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
On the one hand, the guy sells illicit chemicals on a sketchy website

783
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
invested in a brothel and seems like a petty conman and criminal.

784
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
But on the other hand, he definitely has some engineering prowess.

785
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
He strapped a jet engine to the back of his Honda.

786
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
He may have actually met with Edward Teller and he probably did do some work at Los Alamos.

787
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Finally, his story just seems so consistent.

788
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
He really doesn't seem like a guy who thinks he's lying.

789
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Look, there's a lot of weird stuff about the Bob Lazar story.

790
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
His story has been absolutely consistent since the late 1980s.

791
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:59,000
It's a classic intelligence tactic to give people 95% correct information and 5% false information.

792
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
You can track the flow of information by the uniquely false details in it,

793
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
and you can easily discredit the leak.

794
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Bob Lazar would hang around some interesting characters,

795
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
guys like John Lear, who flew cargo planes for the CIA in the 70s.

796
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Lear definitely seemed to spread disinformation in other cases.

797
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
He was also the son of Bill Lear, inventor of the Learjet,

798
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
who may have been involved in the original UFO program.

799
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:30,000
My question is, did John Lear manipulate Lazar into spreading a bunch of pure disinformation?

800
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
And so Lazar's claim that he worked on UFOs was all a complete lie.

801
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Or was Lazar just a disclosure test for Lear and others around him?

802
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Let's see how the public reacts to this guy.

803
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
He's easy to discredit, but mostly telling the truth.

804
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Personally, I'm not sure what to think and would love to meet Lazar myself

805
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and ask him what he meant when he told Jacques Vallee about the liquid he was made to drink

806
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
and the memory lapses it caused, and about his relationship with John Lear.

807
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,000
There's probably a small contingency out there that says the US needs to maintain primacy.

808
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
You have this exotic tech that we've found, you know, in the case of whatever crashes that have occurred,

809
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
we don't know exactly what to do with it. Maybe we made more progress early on than we have now.

810
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,000
We need to kind of refresh the talent pool and maybe out ourselves as a program

811
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
and front-run immunity through legislature to do that.

812
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
What do you say to those people?

813
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Yeah, because that's something I tried to expel as a news nation.

814
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I can't remember how they edited it or whatever.

815
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,000
But it actually hurts national supremacy to keep it obtusely secret.

816
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

817
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
You can't even bring the right people on it.

818
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:48,000
You know, say the best theoretician in quantum chromodynamics just happens to smoke marijuana

819
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
so you can't get a clearance and you can't get on the program.

820
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:56,000
So it actually hurts national security by not opening it up,

821
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:04,000
at least in an appropriate way that we're not compromising anything that somebody could use illicitly to hurt people.

822
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
But at least, and that's why I use the nuclear physics example.

823
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Yeah, the program should want to out itself.

824
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Yeah, it's like, yeah, protect what can be weaponized, but generally allow it to be studied openly.

825
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
But there's absolutely like no cogent plan that I'm aware of to do so.

826
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Congressman, do you think that these reverse engineering programs have made any progress or do you think?

827
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Yeah, I do. I just don't think they're going to scrape.

828
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
If they did, we wouldn't. We would own the skies if they had it.

829
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Isn't it in their best interest to just get immunity for themselves and try to refresh the talent pool

830
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
if these people are, you know, they're all old and it's completely from heart mentalized

831
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
and they haven't made, you know, in the Wilson memo?

832
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
They're completely arrogant. They're completely arrogant.

833
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
They're above the laws and they're above the...

834
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Why aren't they releasing the Kennedy files?

835
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Nobody's alive 60 years, but every president...

836
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Do you think there's a connection between that and this?

837
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I've heard that. I would hate to speculate.

838
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I'm more just, I want the surface. Just give me the stuff.

839
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Gotcha. Thank you.

840
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,

841
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.

842
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I have no idea if JFK's death had anything to do with UFOs,

843
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:26,000
but there is a letter that was supposedly declassified due to a Freedom of Information Act request in 2006.

844
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
It was from JFK to the director of the CIA at the time, John McCone.

845
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Its date? November 12th, 1963, just 10 days before the president's assassination.

846
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:42,000
In the letter, JFK is asking for the full data on unknowns or UFOs

847
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
so we can coordinate more tightly with Russians in space

848
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
and they don't mistake these UFOs as acts of American aggression or reconnaissance.

849
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I've called the guy who used the Freedom of Information Act to retrieve this document

850
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
like five times now and he's not playing ball.

851
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
So I have no idea if this document is real.

852
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
And an anonymous archivist that handles a lot of JFK's letters

853
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
say that there are some anomalies in the letter that make him skeptical.

854
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
So who knows?

855
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
But I will say this is a very weird non sequitur from former CIA director Mike Pompeo

856
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:18,000
when asked why the nearly 5,000 JFK files still won't be released to this day.

857
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Why'd you fight to keep the JFK files secret?

858
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
These don't hold the dark secrets that everybody wants to just hold up as the bogeyman.

859
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I saw the UFO files too. We've got bigger problems.

860
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
What do you say to the people who say this is a PSYOP

861
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
and they just want black budget funding so the information might be right,

862
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
but they just want to be able to have increased surveillance in the skies and in space or whatever?

863
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Yeah, that comes up I think with some people that have like an issue with it

864
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:52,000
where you got to remember like national security threat is the way to get Congress alerted and engaged.

865
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
That is like the operative word that Congress responds to.

866
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
The narrative that this could be a threat.

867
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Because look, to be honest with you, I think this stuff's been going on for thousands of years.

868
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And so it does frustrate me a little bit when it's like, you know, we need to be able to shoot these things down.

869
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
It's like, I don't think they're really, you know, an immediate existential threat.

870
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Yeah, it might not be the smartest idea to try to fire back when they're not firing at you.

871
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
They'll take you out real quick if they can fly faster than light and do all the stuff they're doing.

872
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
So yeah, it's probably not a good idea, right?

873
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
We probably shouldn't attack the zookeeper.

874
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Yeah, exactly. Don't attack the zookeepers. That's probably a good idea.

875
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Stick to the facts, write it down, and don't speculate what you think it is because it will spoil your decision.

876
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:46,000
The thing that frustrated me about the hearing was, look, I think Ryan Graves is awesome.

877
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
And I think as is Commander David Fravor, I think they're showing a lot of courage.

878
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:56,000
But it felt like their simple takeaway is we need more sensors and we need a better collection process and more standard taxonomy.

879
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
All of which are very important.

880
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:07,000
But it's this kind of lazy data story that I think comes from Silicon Valley where it's like, if we just get a bigger database of the UFOs,

881
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,000
the machine learning classifier will somehow spit out the answer as to what they are.

882
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Yeah, the only thing you're going to get from external observation, at least from the lens I look through, right,

883
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
you're going to get what they call activity-based intelligence, ABI.

884
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
So you'll figure out where the true hotspots are, but it's not the end all be all.

885
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:29,000
If you're trying to find a needle in a haystack, you don't want to add to the haystack.

886
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And I think we are over indexed on...

887
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Yeah, over saturated with data.

888
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Over saturated with data in some ways, and it could be probably better standardized, so I'll give them that.

889
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
But we're under indexed on theory.

890
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:47,000
And to my mind, we have one pretty strong theoretician in Jacques Vallée,

891
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
who really, if you read like The Invisible College, which he wrote in 1975,

892
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:58,000
that is the tip of the spear now in terms of theory on UFOs, which is wild to me.

893
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Jacques Vallée might be the most preeminent UFO researcher in the world.

894
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,000
In fact, he was Steven Spielberg's inspiration for the eccentric French scientist

895
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
played by Francois Truffaut in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

896
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Yeah, nobody's really replaced him at that level, and especially hypotheses that are even a little more testable.

897
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:25,000
But what the average person might not know about Jacques is that he's obsessed with time travel.

898
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
In fact, on the set of Close Encounters, he got into an argument with Steven Spielberg.

899
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
And we had a long discussion about what UFOs could be.

900
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:38,000
And of course, for him, the main point of the movie was entertainment,

901
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,000
and it was appropriate for the UFOs to be extraterrestrial visitors.

902
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Jacques wanted the UFOs and the aliens in the movie to be represented in a more nuanced way

903
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
and actually linked with time travel, not just space travel.

904
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I think that the extraterrestrial hypothesis is actually more far-fetched.

905
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I think the idea that another species would evolutionarily converge to be bipedal,

906
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,000
to have kind of the symmetric, you know, bilateral symmetry.

907
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Yeah, because if we look at like the aerial school event,

908
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:19,000
you know, if we believe the hundred schoolchildren that saw bipedal, you know, hominid looking kind of NHI,

909
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
then that seems pretty rare to have the same development where they're going to...

910
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:32,000
It's either extraterrestrial and we're seeing bioengineered beings that look similar to us

911
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
for ease of communication and acceptance, maybe?

912
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And that is like almost like an avatar for the intelligence behind, you know,

913
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
the ghost behind the machine or whatever.

914
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
They were engineered specifically to look like that and it wasn't natural.

915
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Jacques' heir in the UFO theory world is a guy named Mike Masters,

916
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
a biological anthropologist at Montana Tech University,

917
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
who believes that aliens are basically just humans from the future

918
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
who figured out time travel and are going back in time to visit us in the present.

919
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,000
We see them less often because we're just one small blip on their geographic map of time.

920
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I like the sort of, you know, beings from the future hypothesis for a few reasons.

921
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
So there's actually a concept in evolutionary biology called neotony

922
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,000
where your distant offspring looks like your kids currently.

923
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And if you think about a lot of these sort of close encounters of the third kind,

924
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,000
they often are described as, you know, the beings are sort of childlike in nature.

925
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
If you think about how we're actually evolving as a species,

926
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
you know, our bodies are becoming somewhat vestigial.

927
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
You know, we have an abundant amount of resources that are being distributed to us.

928
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
We don't need them.

929
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Their morphologies are going to change.

930
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Just wither away a little bit.

931
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And then our brains are becoming actually more important.

932
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Decision making is becoming more important.

933
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
If we have any sort of latent intuitive powers, that's going to be more important.

934
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
And these things are supposedly a little more telepathic.

935
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Their eyes are sort of slits.

936
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
You're going to have more screen time going forward.

937
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And so it does feel like that's kind of the way that we're evolving.

938
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Aliens are weirdly non-interventionist.

939
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
In many of the abductions that get reported,

940
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
it's almost like they have a prime directive to not say or do too much.

941
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
In fact, in many cases, Mike Masters studied,

942
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
the abductees had to sanitize themselves, shower or do chemical rinses

943
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
before boarding the alien craft.

944
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
This would make sense as time travel involves all sorts of issues

945
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
like the grandfather paradox.

946
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
You can't go back in time and kill your own grandfather.

947
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Otherwise, how would you exist in the present?

948
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Any little thing you do in the past might dramatically change timelines

949
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
or trajectories in a way that breaks the present.

950
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
So maybe this alien non-interventionism points further towards the time travel theory.

951
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Many abductees also report lost time.

952
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Again, this might be explained by abductions occurring in another temporal dimension.

953
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Time's crazy because it's defined at some levels as the Planck length, right?

954
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
It's the time it takes a photon of light to cross Planck length.

955
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And you know Planck literally, after discovering the Planck length,

956
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
thought that that would be the best way to communicate with aliens

957
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
because it's literally the shortest length.

958
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I did not know that.

959
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Yeah, it's like he would joke about that.

960
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Yeah, and it's all relative, right?

961
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
It's based on your reference frames,

962
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
especially if you're near a gravitational source.

963
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:44,000
You know, general relativity teaches us that clocks either speed up or slow down

964
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
based on whether they're near a gravitational source or not.

965
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
One over r squared over distance comes off.

966
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And we've proven that having cesium clocks on airplanes in the 70s.

967
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,000
We actually showed atomic clock differences based on force of gravity.

968
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Yeah, time is really not a constant.

969
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
The way we conceptualize time, it's not constant at all.

970
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
And yet the felt sense of it is constant.

971
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Maybe true ontological reality, time is way trippier than we realize,

972
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
and maybe that speaks to this sort of alien thing,

973
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
especially because people seem to see crafts and aliens

974
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
when they're in specific kind of heightened states of consciousness.

975
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
And so maybe time doesn't work quite the way we think it is,

976
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
but in ordinary consciousness,

977
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,000
we sort of snap it into this kind of linear classical epistemology

978
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
that we experience.

979
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Yeah, and that's what I was trying to expounce upon

980
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
when I mentioned the holographic principle.

981
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
If you want to imagine 3D objects such as yourself

982
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
casting a shadow onto a 2D surface, that's the holographic principle.

983
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
So you can be projected, quasi-projected from higher dimensional space

984
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
to lower dimensional.

985
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
It's a scientific trope that you can actually cross.

986
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Originally, the holographic principle was created

987
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
to explain how information is encoded on an event horizon in a black hole.

988
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
But maybe that's what we're seeing,

989
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
is we're seeing higher dimensional stuff casting shadow into our space,

990
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
just like how we cast a shadow on a two-dimensional surface,

991
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
which is like the sidewalk, right?

992
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Well, if you were on Flatland,

993
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:19,000
you would have no idea that this crazy 3D monster was out there,

994
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
but all you're seeing is the shadow, and it's called quasi-projection.

995
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
And maybe some of the UAPs are not even...

996
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
They're here, but they're not actually from out there.

997
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I cannot show you a tesseract,

998
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,000
because I and you are trapped in three dimensions.

999
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,000
But what I can show you is the shadow in three dimensions

1000
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
of a four-dimensional hypercube or tesseract.

1001
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
This is it.

1002
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Like if it exists outside of 4D, you know, time space or whatever,

1003
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
say this is, you know, you have a 2D universe,

1004
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
and this is a 3D object.

1005
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
If it intersects, you're just going to see a sliver of it.

1006
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
So you'll just see a disk.

1007
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
That would make sense, I think, in two ways.

1008
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
One is that a lot of people that seem to see crafts

1009
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
and sometimes, quote-unquote, go inside of them,

1010
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
the inside is bigger than the outside.

1011
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
So Jacques Vallee describes a woman in San Jose

1012
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
seeing this, you know, flying saucer.

1013
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
She walks in, she's in a movie theater all of a sudden.

1014
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
There was one case in good old San Jose.

1015
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
A woman had seen something over her house.

1016
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
It was a big disk.

1017
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Then I say, well, when you went inside,

1018
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
you said, you know, there was this being,

1019
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
and the being took you on a staircase.

1020
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I say, where did the staircase go?

1021
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Well, the staircase went up the side of this big round room.

1022
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I say, how would you compare it?

1023
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
It's, well, like a movie house, you know, like an amphitheater.

1024
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I said, that's bigger than your house.

1025
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Why is the inside bigger than the outside?

1026
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
And so this is a constant sort of, again,

1027
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
if we're looking for patterns,

1028
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
and that's like a good way to kind of theorize,

1029
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
you know, that would make sense

1030
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
if it's this shadow casting sort of thing.

1031
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Well, that almost sounds like a physical translation

1032
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
from lower to higher dimensional space.

1033
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
That seems to be what's going on there,

1034
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
and I don't know if we have a good framework

1035
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
on how to smoothly do something like that.

1036
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I don't even know.

1037
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I think if anyone would know about aliens on Earth,

1038
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
it would probably be me.

1039
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
He's topping on the alien bandwagon

1040
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
as of the last two days, by the way.

1041
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Well, he did, and then he goes,

1042
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
somebody should win Psyop of the Year Award or something.

1043
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
So I don't know, it's like, what do you think, man?

1044
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
What's your take?

1045
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
He was just writing the first tweet of like,

1046
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I'm not going to say there are aliens, but like...

1047
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Yeah, I'm not sure what's going on with him.

1048
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I think he's probably a little pissed

1049
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
because he's using chemical propulsion.

1050
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Yeah, exactly.

1051
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
We need the Howard Hughes of our generation

1052
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
to get access to the good stuff.

1053
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I've always found it fascinating

1054
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
that America's real-life Iron Man,

1055
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
its most impressive industrialist,

1056
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
seems to be so sure of the fact

1057
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
that we're in a simulation.

1058
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
The odds that we're in base reality

1059
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
is one in billions.

1060
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
But doesn't like entertaining

1061
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
possible sightings of aliens.

1062
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
If we're in a simulation, why aren't you doing

1063
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
any speculating as to who simulated us?

1064
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I mean, if they show up, I'm like, great.

1065
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Okay, now this isn't your information.

1066
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
The conventional story, especially

1067
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
after the Copernican Revolution,

1068
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
is that the Earth is a lucky accident

1069
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
that allows for life.

1070
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
You do have sort of weird aspects of reality

1071
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
like the anthropic principle.

1072
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
The idea of Planck's constant was slightly different.

1073
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Or hydrogen bonded with oxygen

1074
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
in a different way that didn't form

1075
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
other crystal structures.

1076
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Ice wouldn't float above water,

1077
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
usually solid sink below liquids,

1078
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
and we wouldn't have a habitable Earth.

1079
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
And so you have all these sort of things

1080
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
in physics that if they were slightly different,

1081
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
we wouldn't have this sort of Goldilocks

1082
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
perfect habitable zone.

1083
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Oh, yeah, I mean, Earth's like very finely tuned, right?

1084
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
The temperature gradient is just enough.

1085
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Is that a coincidence,

1086
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
or did aliens set this up?

1087
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I don't know.

1088
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
You could even think of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

1089
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
to measure position and momentum at the same time

1090
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
as like a computational caching function.

1091
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Oh, interesting.

1092
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
You can't compute everything.

1093
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Your RAM's not that good.

1094
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And maybe if we are

1095
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
in a simulation, our perceptive

1096
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
capabilities were artificially

1097
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
limited by the simulators.

1098
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
We only see between 400 and 700

1099
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
nanometers of the electromagnetic

1100
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
wave spectrum. We only hear certain

1101
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
frequencies. That's why dog whistles

1102
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
are inaudible to humans. If we really

1103
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
wanted to create safe artificial

1104
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
general intelligence, we might initially

1105
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
experiment with artificial life

1106
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
so limited in its perception

1107
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
that it doesn't even know we exist.

1108
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
So it definitely can't hurt us.

1109
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Forward looking infrared caught

1110
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
the famous Tic Tac video in 2004.

1111
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
What if we had infrared sensors

1112
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
or for that matter, gravity wave

1113
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
detectors in our pockets?

1114
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
How many more sightings would we have?

1115
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
That explains why UFOs are disproportionately

1116
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
picked up by military bases.

1117
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It's the robust multi-sensory

1118
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
detection that you find on those bases

1119
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
that makes all the difference.

1120
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
There is no understanding

1121
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
of alien visits

1122
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
that has them only visit

1123
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
restricted Navy airspace

1124
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
to be picked up by pilots.

1125
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
It's an observer and collection bias

1126
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
issue where you have all the eyeballs

1127
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
and all the sensors in those areas.

1128
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
If you were to do an activity-based

1129
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
intelligence across the globe,

1130
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
if we actually

1131
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
have an open and honest kind of collection system,

1132
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I think we'd probably see

1133
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
some hot spots that don't even make any sense.

1134
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I don't like throwing shade, but like Neil McGrath

1135
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Tyson, right? He's made up his mind.

1136
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I've read his tweets

1137
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
and I'm like, dude, you have a PhD in

1138
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
physics? Where's your curiosity?

1139
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I can't even believe. There's no evidence

1140
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
that would convince an authentic

1141
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
skeptic. I have credentials too,

1142
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
and I'm happy to go toe-to-toe with you.

1143
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
If he wants to debate me, I'd

1144
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
be fine with that.

1145
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
When I started studying physics in college,

1146
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I became an intel guy. I got

1147
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
briefed a lot of programs.

1148
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I figured, oh, I would know if it's a thing.

1149
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I kind of

1150
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
ascribed to the

1151
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Enrico Fermi thing where

1152
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
wouldn't it be obvious when they'd just be

1153
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
flying around and

1154
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
they wouldn't care and they would just land

1155
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
and say hello. But that's like an

1156
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
overly simplistic thought.

1157
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Humanistic too, very humanistic.

1158
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Humanistic, you're assuming that they

1159
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
have the same kind of intent in us.

1160
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
You assume they operate

1161
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
in the electromagnetic

1162
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
spectrum that we can observe normally.

1163
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
And then also

1164
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
you're assuming that they would want this

1165
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
kind of open, obvious

1166
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
kind of interaction and

1167
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
are not doing cover concealment techniques

1168
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
where they're obfuscating their activity

1169
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
because maybe they're

1170
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
observing us for some purpose.

1171
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
What if they're von Neumann probes,

1172
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
right? Do you guys know von Neumann probes?

1173
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
No. Von Neumann replicators?

1174
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Well, just self-replicating tech

1175
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
that's disposable in nature. If you're

1176
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
trying to send something out simple and engineered

1177
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
to explore the cosmos.

1178
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
There's always a question of

1179
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
what was the first self-replicating

1180
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
organism? I think the big mystery

1181
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
is how does chemistry turn

1182
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
into biology? And we have

1183
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
these people that say, oh, it was just

1184
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
this primordial soup and you had all

1185
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
these chemicals kind of like floating around

1186
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
and they've done experiments like this and never been

1187
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
able to recreate life through those experiments.

1188
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And it's a really

1189
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
open question, like how did life

1190
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
form? And I think it's

1191
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
probably much more trippy and interesting

1192
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
than like just a chemical soup. Just

1193
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
the chemicals happen to bond in a certain way. It's a

1194
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
happy accident. And Crick's view was

1195
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
that DNA could not have emerged

1196
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
accidentally from the primeval

1197
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
soup on this planet in

1198
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
just a hundred million years. It

1199
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
needed much longer.

1200
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
He still bought into the primeval soup

1201
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
idea, but not on this planet.

1202
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
What he came down to was that there must have been

1203
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
some other planet somewhere else

1204
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
where a primeval soup had

1205
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
existed and there had been enough time

1206
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
for DNA to

1207
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
emerge from the accidental bumping together

1208
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
of molecules. That's, by the way, something I'm a bit skeptical

1209
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
of anywhere. There was actually a

1210
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
French kind of evolutionary

1211
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
theorist and philosopher

1212
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
named Henri Bergson. He thought the

1213
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
sun was somehow essential to

1214
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
evolution. If you think about it...

1215
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
That makes sense. It's mutations.

1216
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
You need mutations. You need genetic mutations

1217
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
for evolution to do a great... It's a radiological...

1218
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
You know, it's at least putting out ultraviolet.

1219
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
You know, so... Totally.

1220
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Why are we worried about a Japanese

1221
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
nuclear spill? What happened at Fukushima

1222
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
and Chernobyl? You had an acceleration

1223
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
of evolution due to radiation.

1224
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Maybe the sun is an extremely sophisticated

1225
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
nuclear fusion reactor that powers

1226
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
the Earth and the Earth's electromagnetic

1227
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
field was simulated to support

1228
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
life. Astronauts often

1229
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
have to take human resonance machines

1230
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
up with them to space to mimic

1231
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
the electromagnetic field of the Earth.

1232
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Otherwise, their bodies often

1233
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
malfunction. You know, if you put a

1234
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
frog embryo in a Faraday

1235
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
cage, it does not develop

1236
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
normally. And then,

1237
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
you can change

1238
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
the cell gradient

1239
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
of like a

1240
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
tadpole where you've severed

1241
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
the arm of the tadpole

1242
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
to the cell gradients of the head cells

1243
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
and you can grow, you know, a chimeric

1244
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
two-headed tadpole.

1245
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
And so there's something around kind of the

1246
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
electromagnetic field that is orthogonal

1247
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
and maybe even upstream

1248
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
of DNA in terms of morphology.

1249
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Yeah, because I've done

1250
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
experiments too with

1251
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
plant growth around high-powerful

1252
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Wi-Fi routers and then actually

1253
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
they don't grow right.

1254
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
It's like pretty, it's kind of concerning.

1255
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I think about the Wi-Fi in my house, I'm like,

1256
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
oh man, am I cooking myself slowly or something?

1257
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Dave ran this morning in a llama race.

1258
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I'm like this.

1259
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
All the others didn't.

1260
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
What's the name of the llama?

1261
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Playboy.

1262
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I think the name of the llama was boy.

1263
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Do you recognize me? This is Stefan ATV.

1264
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Represent.

1265
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Over the past days, you shared with us that you

1266
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
were diagnosed

1267
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
to be on the autism spectrum.

1268
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
How has this

1269
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
served you in your life and in your career

1270
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
and how has it hindered you?

1271
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Yeah, I mean, I didn't know

1272
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
that I was

1273
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
autistic until I was like in my early

1274
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
thirties. So I mean, it served me well in

1275
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
the government because I was super good at

1276
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
doing Intel and like

1277
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Dave, we want you to

1278
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
target this facility.

1279
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Okay, you have six months. Figure

1280
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
out everything. And of course

1281
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I do and that was very good.

1282
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I think especially if you're trying to

1283
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
maintain relationships and stuff and

1284
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
how to read people's emotions

1285
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and how to show your own

1286
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
emotions because, you know, autism, especially

1287
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
if you're, you know,

1288
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
deeper in the spectrum when you get Asperger's

1289
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
and that kind of stuff,

1290
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
you don't know how to even

1291
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
present

1292
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
your emotions in a way to a partner or

1293
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
you know, spouse or whatever.

1294
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
He would come home and tell me like general stuff

1295
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
and I'd be like, yeah, that makes sense.

1296
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Yeah, there's probably aliens like

1297
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
that makes sense.

1298
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Unfortunately, Dave can't

1299
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
talk about the backlash he's received

1300
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
from inside the government because of an

1301
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
ongoing investigation. But a good

1302
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
example of a pretty despicable marginalization

1303
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
attempt from the outside

1304
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
was an article written a few weeks

1305
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
after the hearing by The Intercept.

1306
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
The article describes Dave's hospitalization

1307
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
back in 2018,

1308
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
an episode of alcohol consumption

1309
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
and suicidal ideation that led

1310
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
to a 911 call. But the article

1311
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
failed to mention any of the factors that

1312
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
led to this incident. Yeah, definitely

1313
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
experienced some really nuts stuff.

1314
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Not only has Dave been very

1315
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
open with us and other media

1316
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
about his PTSD from combat

1317
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
experience and having a close friend

1318
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
die while on duty. I had a friend of mine

1319
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
die doing the same stuff I was,

1320
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
you know, six months later going to the

1321
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
same locations. He's also discussed

1322
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
all of the suffering that's resulted from

1323
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
that experience and the proactive

1324
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
techniques he's used to heal from that

1325
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
trauma. So like EMDR therapy,

1326
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
HRV breath work,

1327
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
all that stuff, I was not

1328
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
a believer. But holy crap, at least

1329
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
it worked for me. And I highly recommend

1330
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
anybody that has issues with that maybe try

1331
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
some of that stuff because it seems kind of

1332
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
non-traditional, but it

1333
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
was very valuable.

1334
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Critiquing the substance of

1335
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Dave's argument, saying that they're high

1336
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
level or secondhand, that's

1337
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
all within the public and media's right.

1338
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
But this was a clear cheap shot,

1339
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
a low blow, and one that I suspect

1340
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
was probably driven by a political

1341
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
ulterior motive. Concealing

1342
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
the truth.

1343
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
People like send me

1344
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
memes or

1345
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
TikToks and like, yep,

1346
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
that's mine.

1347
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Have you, in your time

1348
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
in the Navy, have you ever seen something

1349
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
that you couldn't explain or something

1350
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
that- We have a cabin up in the mountains

1351
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
and our former

1352
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
neighbor, he was so interested

1353
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
in UFOs. And he

1354
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
moved to Roswell, New Mexico

1355
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
because he wanted to be close.

1356
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
He claimed he did see something.

1357
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Another question that I always get is like,

1358
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
why is it always an American thing?

1359
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Like, why is this always happening

1360
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
in America? The phenomenon's global,

1361
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
100%. Like, I mean, you look at aerial schools,

1362
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Russians have reported stuff.

1363
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
The Chinese have

1364
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
what they call the Journal UFO Research,

1365
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
which is a

1366
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
published periodical in the

1367
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
People's Republic of China. And you

1368
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
gotta remember, you know,

1369
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
the CCP does not allow

1370
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
fringe beliefs.

1371
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
And, you know, it's basically

1372
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
tacitly endorsed and allowed to

1373
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
since I think the late 90s, I want to say.

1374
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Do you think the

1375
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
three-body problem, kind of the

1376
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
dark forest analogy of aliens

1377
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
was maybe sort of a form of soft

1378
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
disclosure from the Chinese government? Yeah, I mean,

1379
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
I don't know for sure, but they've

1380
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
allowed this sci-fi series

1381
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
to be published by this Chinese author

1382
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
that's, like, pretty trippy. Really trippy.

1383
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
And I don't know, maybe that's a way

1384
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
for the Chinese government to acclimatize

1385
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
the populace.

1386
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Do note, in the South China Morning Post,

1387
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I want to say it was June 2021,

1388
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
and they had an article like, oh, yeah, we have

1389
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
a UAP Task Force 2, we're using

1390
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
AIML to look at UAP

1391
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
sightings. And that's really been their own

1392
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
overt messaging on UAP,

1393
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
at least to an English-speaking kind of

1394
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
audience. Oh, yeah, we understand that's a problem,

1395
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
we have a Task Force 2.

1396
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Isn't what's happening in Ukraine

1397
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
kind of an argument against the practical

1398
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
application of these technologies

1399
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
because if either side wanted it,

1400
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
it kind of definitively win, and you

1401
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
had this kind of faster-than-light travel thing.

1402
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Well, you'd have to be willing to

1403
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
reveal your ace in

1404
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
the hole. Sure. Because once

1405
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
you use it, then you burn it, and then now everybody

1406
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
knows. Gotcha. Perhaps this is

1407
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
a good time to talk about the frame of the

1408
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
public debate on UFOs,

1409
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
which is frustratingly stupid and

1410
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
simplistic. It's frozen between a

1411
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
sensationalist indiscriminate belief

1412
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
in everything and smug

1413
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
elitist dismissiveness. The whole conversation

1414
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
is basically, is this

1415
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
a PSYOP or is this real?

1416
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
The answer is it's both.

1417
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Those two things aren't mutually exclusive.

1418
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
In fact, if the phenomena

1419
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
is real, there are more likely

1420
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
to be PSYOPs surrounding it. And those

1421
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
PSYOPs are going to be more effective

1422
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
if the phenomena is real.

1423
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
And yeah, if there are vehicles in the sky

1424
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
running circles around American state-of-the-art

1425
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
fighter jets, do you not

1426
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
think the government would try to get in front of

1427
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
that narrative and at times use it

1428
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
for its own purposes? We know the Air

1429
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Force tried to marginalize UFOs

1430
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
with Blue Book, but later in 1979,

1431
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
the Air Force drove a man

1432
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
crazy by playing up his belief in

1433
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
aliens. Paul Benowitz, I'm sure

1434
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
you're, are you familiar with him? I've heard

1435
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
about it, yeah. He, you know, saw

1436
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
some strange craft

1437
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
activity and didn't know what it was.

1438
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
And Richard Doty, who was an

1439
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Air Force disinfo guy,

1440
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
was kind of assigned to

1441
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
screw him up mentally.

1442
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
So we know UFOs are part

1443
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
PSYOP. That's old news.

1444
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
The real question is, is this

1445
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
only a PSYOP? Because if it

1446
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
is, it cuts against everything

1447
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
we know about our pretty dysfunctional

1448
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
government. It's basically the best

1449
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
PSYOP of all time. It runs across

1450
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
government agencies that don't always get

1451
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
along. Presidents on both

1452
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
sides of the aisle. Fighter pilots

1453
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
and radar operators who adhere

1454
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
to a culture of humility. And of

1455
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
course, hundreds of thousands, if not

1456
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
millions, of average civilians.

1457
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
The null hypothesis that

1458
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
this is purely a PSYOP

1459
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
is almost harder to defend

1460
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
than just admitting the existence of

1461
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
non-human intelligence. But you shouldn't

1462
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
blindly trust me, or Dave

1463
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Grush for that matter. Do your

1464
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
own research.

1465
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Talk about, I mean, you have people like

1466
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Steven Pinker who are like, this is the best

1467
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
we've ever had it. I think that's BS.

1468
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
So maybe violence is at an all-time low.

1469
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
But it's because we have nukes now, so any

1470
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
war is mutually assured destruction.

1471
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
And so if there's a world beyond

1472
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
the material world, and

1473
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
that can somehow be accessed or

1474
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
communicated with in any possible

1475
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
way, it might be sort of a crazy

1476
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Hail Mary, but you gotta throw

1477
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
the Hail Mary now. You can't

1478
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
run the ball.

1479
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Is there something you would like to say directly to someone?

1480
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
On the program? Yeah, I know if you're on the

1481
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
program, I understand

1482
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
empathetically, you know,

1483
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
the risks,

1484
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
what you put yourself through.

1485
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
We're trying to create a time where

1486
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
we can get this out there,

1487
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
recruit better people,

1488
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
hopefully protect those who want to go

1489
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
forward. If you want to go forward,

1490
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
there is a legal process, either through

1491
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
PPD-19, if it's an intel thing,

1492
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
there's other inspector generals.

1493
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
You do have the right to go

1494
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
directly to Congress, and then of course

1495
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
some of the senior leaders that have known

1496
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
about this stuff, and I understand

1497
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
they were in positions where they

1498
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
had to make decisions just like anybody

1499
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
else, and they're not the top of the pyramid.

1500
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I think the time is

1501
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
right to cement maybe your final legacy

1502
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
and to help out, even though

1503
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
I know there'll be some admittance

1504
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
of, you know,

1505
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
maybe decisions you've made that you wish

1506
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
in the past maybe you didn't make.

1507
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
But I think it's time

1508
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
to move forward, and I think we'll be stronger

1509
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
as a nation and

1510
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
as a world.

1511
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I think it's going to enhance national security,

1512
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
enhance peer

1513
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
competition policing

1514
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
so people aren't doing things unethical

1515
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
and immoral. If everything's in secret,

1516
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
everybody can get away with things

1517
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
that might be illegal, unethical, immoral,

1518
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
and

1519
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
hold our adversaries accountable

1520
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
publicly if this is a thing that we

1521
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
acknowledge. And once again,

1522
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
nuclear physics, broadly studied.

1523
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Nuclear weapons development,

1524
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
that's classified.

1525
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
And that's all I have to say.

1526
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Just come on.

1527
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Do you think in some ways UFOs are like a

1528
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Rorschach test? And the way I mean that

1529
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
is that

1530
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
you could use them as an auspice

1531
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
to sort of clamp down and create

1532
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
one world government or something

1533
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
and create extra surveillance

1534
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
and say, you know, this is this big thread

1535
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
and we're not at the top of the food chain

1536
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
and they're apex predators and

1537
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
you've got to be careful. Watch your step.

1538
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Or they could be incredibly libertarian

1539
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
because it's like actually

1540
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
you know, terrestrial governments aren't

1541
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
as powerful maybe as we

1542
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
thought that they were. And

1543
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
you know, I think it could go in

1544
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
either direction. Yeah, or it's just like

1545
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
they're just simply waiting until we like generally

1546
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
care about that.

1547
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
We just like we look at it. We're like,

1548
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
huh, that's interesting. And then we go about

1549
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
our day and we don't even integrate

1550
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
the phenomenon into our lives.

1551
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,000
In terms of

1552
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
people's reaction to this,

1553
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
look, I'm angry about

1554
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
possible white collar crime,

1555
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
especially, you know, people possibly being

1556
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
driven crazy or to their death.

1557
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
That's horrible. Yeah. And then

1558
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I also think on some level

1559
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
people are too focused on

1560
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
government kind of recrimination.

1561
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
It is time for transparency.

1562
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Transparency. Transparency. Transparency.

1563
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
And not on the fact that

1564
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
this is the nature of reality.

1565
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
These things might make you a biblical

1566
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
literalist.

1567
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Do you believe that

1568
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
the phenomenon is the next big great

1569
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
religion in the world? Yeah, basically.

1570
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
The phenomenon has probably already

1571
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
influenced all the other religions already. So

1572
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
it's just maybe we're looking at the source code.

1573
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Yeah, if you're looking at the source code.

1574
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
We're at the graphic user interface level. It's like

1575
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
IP header and we're getting into

1576
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
finally getting into the information

1577
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
flow.

1578
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
In her book, American Cosmic,

1579
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Diana Pasolka makes the pretty

1580
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
convincing case that many

1581
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
seemingly divine contact experiences

1582
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
in the past could have actually

1583
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
been what we now call UFO experiences.

1584
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Just take the case of Saint Francis

1585
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
of Assisi. His close confidant,

1586
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Brother Leo, documents the experience

1587
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
describing sound and

1588
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
fury creating atmospheric sparks,

1589
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
a spinning disc, telepathic

1590
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
communication between Francis

1591
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
and the disc, and then Francis

1592
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
is wounded by rays of light.

1593
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Francis interprets these hand wounds

1594
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
as the stigmata of Christ,

1595
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
but Pasolka speculates that maybe

1596
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
this was just radiation damage from

1597
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
a UFO experience.

1598
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
You know, I was reasonably religious,

1599
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
but nothing like crazy, kind of average.

1600
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Studied physics,

1601
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I became kind of agnostic. I was like,

1602
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
eh, I don't know about this, all this kind of

1603
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
woo-woo, you know, stuff that the church

1604
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
expouses and stuff. And then

1605
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
oddly enough, I've kind of come

1606
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
full circle in

1607
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
some sense where there

1608
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
is this higher sentience.

1609
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
There seems to be,

1610
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
I think we're created

1611
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
beings in some manner, whether

1612
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
it be some Pamspermia from little G gods

1613
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
or big G gods. I think about the

1614
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
people, the journey I had,

1615
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
and the most random people

1616
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
that I've known that were placed in my life

1617
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
like 14 years ago, you know, shut the door

1618
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
in my office at the NGA and were like, look, dude.

1619
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
And, you know, they started telling me

1620
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
all this stuff that I was, and they brought these

1621
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
like crazy intel reports. I guess I was

1622
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
kind of the right guy that was chosen

1623
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
to do this thing, I guess, but

1624
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
so yeah, I've come full circle

1625
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
in my belief system.

1626
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
For me, it's inspiring,

1627
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
because it's like this idea

1628
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
that it's just, you know, eat, drink

1629
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
and be merry or whatever. You know, you just,

1630
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
you live, you pay taxes, you

1631
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
work a job, and then you die. Yeah, it adds meaning to life.

1632
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
It's just like the Vatican Observatory

1633
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
saying, yeah, we're like cool with other

1634
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
sentient life that shows God

1635
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
paints like a broad brush.

1636
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
That's pretty cool. And the Catholic Church

1637
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
is very accepting on that, and it just shows

1638
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
God's providence

1639
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
and God's creative powers if

1640
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
there's actually other interesting

1641
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
sentience besides us. Totally.

1642
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
It's like, you know, what was it,

1643
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
in the movie Contact, it's a total

1644
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
waste of space if it's just us, right?

1645
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
It's like the famous line in the movie.

1646
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Carl Sagan was a great communicator, probably

1647
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
one of the best. Yeah. He also met

1648
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
a lot with Kit Green towards the end of his career.

1649
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
He was a CIA guy, very into

1650
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
UFOs. Yeah, you were telling me that. I didn't

1651
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
know that. You can count

1652
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
on Jesse to tell you these weird facts.

1653
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Yeah, I thought I had a lot of

1654
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
useless knowledge, but this guy

1655
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
was like, it's not useless,

1656
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
but it's pretty intense. It's pretty useless

1657
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
until now.

1658
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
This is like

1659
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
the mega interview. We're covering every

1660
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
potential trippy

1661
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
slash esoteric slash

1662
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
conspiratorial

1663
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
thing at once. This

1664
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
justifies me being paranoid

1665
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
in my room reading

1666
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
about weird shit and being criticized

1667
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
by friends and colleagues for years.

1668
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
This is more you

1669
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
educating me than me saying anything

1670
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
for some interview right now.

1671
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
So it's kind of cool.

1672
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Yeah, I've always learned something when

1673
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I'm talking to you and sometimes I'm like hanging up the phone

1674
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
and you call me and I'm like, I don't know about this guy.

1675
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
He's going crazy.

1676
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I think he's like really

1677
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
going deep before I think he's

1678
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
loosening his grip. That was good.

1679
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Yeah, but

1680
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
oh my god.

1681
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
That was a crazy hummingbird.

1682
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
That was a crazy hummingbird. Maybe it was a DARPA spy cam

1683
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
or something. Oh man, that's a good

1684
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
time, bro. It should have nine line verses

1685
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
a year.

1686
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
It brings science

1687
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
and religion together in a way that

1688
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
these two things have been sort of

1689
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
cleaved or bifurcated

1690
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
since the Enlightenment.

1691
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
This could possibly reconcile those

1692
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
two things, which would be absolutely amazing

1693
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
where you could read the Bible and

1694
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
you could say some of this stuff could actually happen

1695
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
in the context of aliens. Yeah, like the panspermia,

1696
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
creationism. This might

1697
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
actually prove certain religious texts

1698
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
and what they've espoused with like

1699
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
little G gods and at least

1700
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
for me, you know, spiritually

1701
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
at least my belief system, it's certainly

1702
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
opened my eyes to

1703
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
the universe

1704
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
is not clockwork. Everything

1705
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
we see in our day to day life is not

1706
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
everything that exists

1707
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
and if there's truly other sentient

1708
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
intelligences, I mean it just inspires

1709
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
my curiosity like I'd like to know

1710
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
what their belief systems are

1711
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
and how maybe we'll find out

1712
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
that that matches with ours and it actually bolsters

1713
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
our, you know,

1714
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
beliefs. Maybe we can ascend to

1715
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
per your video in the Berkshires,

1716
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
you want to repeat it

1717
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Ammar? Yeah, I mean the

1718
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
ending result was

1719
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
is the universe ignoring us?

1720
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Because we're not at their level yet

1721
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
we haven't reached that

1722
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
height of awareness in the society

1723
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
as a people. Is this an opportunity

1724
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
for us to examine ourselves to

1725
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
figure out why we have not

1726
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
been a part of this bigger

1727
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
ecosystem? Interesting friend

1728
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
visiting us.

1729
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Visiting? Non-human intelligence?

1730
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Non-human intelligence.

1731
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
We have evidence of non-human

1732
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
intelligence.

1733
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
One of the most powerful

1734
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
witness testimonies that I've seen in all the

1735
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
interviews that I've consumed over the past

1736
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
three years was one of the

1737
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
girls from the aerial school case

1738
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
when Dr. John

1739
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Mack was interviewing her and he's trying to

1740
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
understand how the telepathy was working

1741
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
and then she goes out of nowhere

1742
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I think in space there's no love

1743
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
but down here there is.

1744
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Well that's like the near death

1745
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
experiences like

1746
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
proof of heaven by

1747
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Eben Alexander, medical doctor.

1748
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Yeah, he has a very

1749
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
interesting scientific outlook

1750
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
of his near death and that was like this

1751
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
overarching

1752
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
loving energy

1753
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
something when he ascended to this

1754
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
it sounded like another dimensional plane

1755
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
if you will. He had basically

1756
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
a fasciitis of the brain where it was

1757
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
like he was probably going to be

1758
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
brain dead if he even survived

1759
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
but he miraculously came back

1760
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
and he was totally fine but

1761
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
all this knowledge and all this stuff he experienced.

1762
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Well that's a super common thing

1763
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
in alien abduction experiences

1764
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
whether it's the aerial school or

1765
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Commander George Hoover of the

1766
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Navy actually talked about this.

1767
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Aliens often come down and they say you don't know how

1768
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
powerful you are. You don't know how

1769
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
amazing and powerful

1770
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
you are and in a lot of mystery

1771
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
rituals like

1772
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
the Eleusinian mystery rituals

1773
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
and others you experience

1774
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
sort of noesis or it's often

1775
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
accompanied by kind of a near death experience

1776
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
or something but you experience

1777
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
knowledge of your primordial soul

1778
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
and you get this sort of loving

1779
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
state and then you come back down

1780
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
and there is this sort of Allah

1781
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Jesus translation

1782
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
function issue where

1783
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
he was known to speak in riddles and

1784
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
mysteries. There's a great book actually called

1785
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Flatland by Sir Edward Abbott

1786
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
in the late 19th century

1787
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
where it's like if you were a 3D

1788
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
person speaking to a people

1789
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
in Flatland on a 2D plane

1790
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
or you know Plato's

1791
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
cave like you see the light you come

1792
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
down you can't really tell people

1793
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
and then you get persecuted. Well yeah he

1794
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
said he had this knowledge

1795
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
he understood it when he was in that plane

1796
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
but when he came back and was trying

1797
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
to verbalize it and write it down

1798
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
he could not find the

1799
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
human words to translate it

1800
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
it's like almost like our

1801
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
symbol rate is

1802
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
too slow to communicate

1803
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
the information

1804
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
effectively.

1805
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
We're living in a very interesting

1806
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
time. Yeah.

1807
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I'm excited to see where it goes and you're

1808
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
playing a massive part in it so I appreciate

1809
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
everything. Appreciate it. Your service just

1810
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
on a fundamental level you know

1811
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
and you're a real example of

1812
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
like a modern Mr. Smith goes to Washington

1813
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
and you're not doing it in this

1814
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
sort of totally reckless

1815
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
wrecking ball sort of way you're going

1816
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
through the proper processes

1817
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
and doing things legally

1818
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
but also you have agency and you're doing

1819
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
it strategically time after

1820
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
time again people just

1821
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
get like neutered when they're in government

1822
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
and you are doing a big thing

1823
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
so that's cool for young people

1824
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
to see.

1825
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Thank you Dave.

1826
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Thank you for everything man.

1827
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Yeah.

1828
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
We talked about a

1829
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
lot of shit.

1830
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Ladies and gentlemen Neil Armstrong.

1831
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Today we have with us

1832
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
a group of students

1833
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
among America's best.

1834
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
There are great ideas undiscovered.

1835
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Breakthroughs

1836
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
available to those

1837
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
who can remove

1838
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
one of truth's protective

1839
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
layers.
