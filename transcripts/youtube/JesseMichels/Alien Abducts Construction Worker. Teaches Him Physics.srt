1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
You have this amazing blue being experience that prompts you to get into quantum physics.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,360
Because of what this being had showed me, I started looking into this notion of

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,720
longitudinal scalar waves. Now, these were shown to me by this being as slinky, so to speak,

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,120
that exists all around us. You can use the potentials that exist all around us right now

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,160
in the quantum vacuum to surveil an entire room.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,200
How would you do that?

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,920
I don't want to say because it starts to overlap into stuff that's sensitive.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,960
I know a group that is working in the government that has been working on this since the 90s

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,680
and they've had massive success. There are things that I've seen in private laboratories

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,760
that are undeniable and verified by people other than myself in those facilities.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,960
A UAP was hovering near some plants and as an individual approached the UAP,

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,160
the UAP shot off as many people have experienced. However, when the plants that were close to the

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,120
analyzed, they had aged 10 years within X amount of hours. We're dealing with multiple

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,320
factions or elements of both government and private industry that have vast influence on

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,200
what could or could not be revealed and no one really knows what to do. If you reveal some,

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,880
then people are going to take it and run with it and then that's going to open up a whole other

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,360
avenue of research that can be weaponized pretty easily if someone has a nefarious mindset. We have

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,840
mutual friends that are privately working on some of these things where six, seven months worth of

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,400
work in the lab, all of a sudden it's a weapon now and if someone gets a hold of that weapon,

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,640
it's game over.

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:57,840
This interview was one of the most baffling and intriguing I've ever done on this show. Today,

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,800
we will talk to a former construction worker. He was down and out and just scraping by. He then

23
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:09,200
developed an interest in UFOs. Then, he had an interaction with a blue alien being that according

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,120
to him caused him to do a deep dive into quantum physics. All of this sounded pretty crazy when I

25
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,000
first heard about it, but since meeting this next guest, I've introduced him to a Navy scientist

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,520
who's worked at the highest levels of government. Even he was extremely impressed and intrigued by

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,800
this former construction worker's findings. I know all of this sounds insane, but it's true.

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,480
Our next guest was also spotted by the legendary Hal Putoff and Eric Davis, who have also noted

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,600
his impressive knowledge in areas of unorthodox science. Dr. Davis, thank you so very much for

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,000
being here today. Oh, thank you for inviting me. I'm happy to be here. A lot of this guest's

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,360
interests in physics are in a special branch of it called Extended Electrodynamics. We recorded

32
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,280
this interview in early December of 24 and at the time of its recording, Extended Electrodynamics

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,920
was considered quackery. Something you might hear at a zero point energy conference somewhere

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,040
in the southwest from a crystal healer. But right after we recorded this podcast, the National

35
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,920
Science Foundation and NASA co-sponsored a podcast with some elite scientists and engineers

36
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,640
with serious credentials claiming to investigate, you guessed it, Extended Electrodynamics. I've

37
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,600
also heard from multiple other Navy whistleblowers that this framework is very, very real and useful.

38
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,800
When you introduce the scalar field, you now have the possibility of at least three completely new

39
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,480
kinds of waves. Okay, so a construction worker with no formal schooling downloads exotic physics

40
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,000
from a blue alien being and that physics is now being vindicated at the highest levels of

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,360
government in aerospace. Sounds about right for 2025. But this former construction worker hasn't

42
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,280
only agreed to come on my show, he's agreed to speak with any scientist at any level about his

43
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,000
theories on my show as a follow-up. I thought that was a pretty decent show of confidence.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,760
So without further ado, please enjoy this special sit down with this week's American Alchemist,

45
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,160
the scientific savant himself, David Rossi. I'm here with Dave Rossi and I couldn't be more

46
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,000
excited to have this conversation because we've had a lot of offline conversations over the last

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,560
couple of years or year or so. And I'm always wildly impressed at your knowledge of physics,

48
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,600
experimentally and theoretically. And you kind of came out of the blue and had like this extremely

49
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,840
interesting origin story when it came to how you acquired such esoteric knowledge of physics. And

50
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,280
so it's an honor to have you here, man. Well, thank you so much for having me. I really

51
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,120
appreciate it. It's an honor to be here. Like you said, we've spoken for quite a while over the

52
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,840
years and I'm very excited to be on the show. I really appreciate it. Oh, absolutely, man.

53
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,480
Know that the honor is mine and you have a really great podcast everybody should check out as well.

54
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,280
It's called Generation Zed. And so we're going to go to the limits of my knowledge and ability

55
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,800
to understand this stuff. But if we ever exceed that, you can just go watch Zed's channel and it's

56
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,040
great. Thank you. I appreciate it. Yeah, man, of course. So I know you to be somebody extremely

57
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,120
knowledgeable, not only about UFOs from like an investigative lens, which, you know, a lot of

58
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,640
journalists out there know a lot about like, you know, UFOs and the history of the government

59
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,520
vis-a-vis UFOs. You know about it from a scientific perspective. And I think a lot of what you get

60
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:35,040
into is actually just man-made prosaic human exotic technology. Correct. That sort of mimics

61
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,120
UFOs. Maybe it's inspired by UFOs. I don't know. Right. But yeah. If I can give a little background

62
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,600
as to how I got into this basically. So it was around the time that COVID had hit and I decided

63
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,360
to start a small podcast and I didn't think at the time, you know, about four years ago that I would

64
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,080
be where I am currently. And so what happened essentially was I decided to start looking into

65
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,400
the UFO topic in general, UAPs and all that. But then after a couple of years of doing the show,

66
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,040
I started to say to myself, well, I'm very interested in learning about it and making videos

67
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,920
on it. And I was gracious enough to have a small audience that supported me. But I said to myself,

68
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,240
well, what if I can actually try and build something? And so I tried to first dive into

69
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,720
the theory of things like, you know, Maxwell's equations and so on and so forth. And throughout

70
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,800
that process, I recall a very spiritual experience. I'm going to sleep one evening and

71
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,760
it felt like I don't want to use the word abducted because I think that implies that there was some

72
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,320
negative connotation to the experience, which in this case for me, graciously there wasn't.

73
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:44,960
But I remember essentially being, I guess you could say taken by a blue energy type humanoid,

74
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,000
if you will. There were no physical characteristics. It was just pure blue energy.

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,200
And I really couldn't tell- Why do you say humanoid? When do you say?

76
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,600
Well, because it had two arms, two legs. It was just significantly taller than

77
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,000
you or I, for example, height wise. And so- And when you say no physical characteristics,

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,120
it was like you could move right through it with your hand or something.

79
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,520
Essentially, yes. Like a plasma being or something.

80
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,320
Basically, very, very not really dense whatsoever. Sort of like, right, a plasma,

81
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:18,880
electric plasma type being. And I recall, again, I can't say for certain because I don't know if

82
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,920
it was a physical experience or a purely energetic or spiritual one, but I recall opening my eyes

83
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,880
and I saw all this basically white light around me, but it seemed like it was a very convex type

84
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:40,000
structure. And then I recall seeing, I felt like I was very drowsy and I recalled seeing this blue

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,360
being basically standing very close to my head. And then next thing I knew, I basically closed

86
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,760
my eyes and I woke up the next morning and I had all of a sudden this extreme drive and inclination

87
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,760
to study electrical engineering and quantum physics in particular. And I knew absolutely

88
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,440
nothing about it. I failed math, I think almost every year of high school. And so I spent the

89
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,480
first two years from there basically learning, learning, learning. I had made some videos where

90
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,800
I had discussed these type of concepts on my channel without getting into specifics name wise.

91
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,440
I was noticed by a handful of very nice gentlemen that seemingly saw some potential to what I was

92
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,400
saying from a physics and engineering perspective, gave some presentations to those individuals and

93
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:33,440
since then continue to learn, learn. Many, many cups of coffees later, many late nights spent just

94
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:41,200
reading papers, the Soviet papers, the older North American papers, which is I think in terms of

95
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,240
zero point energy tech. A lot of stuff is in the older literature, more so than the modern

96
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,840
literature. And then from there I built a handful of different devices that had some interesting

97
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:00,640
effects that seemed to substantiate what a lot of the theory that people like Dr. Pudoff, Dr. Davis

98
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,160
and others have discussed. However, I must say that there were people going all the way back to

99
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,440
the early 1900s, going back to Nikola Tesla, people for example like Gabriel Krone and E.T.

100
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Whitaker and so on that seemed to substantiate certain experiments that I was doing with a

101
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,400
partner of mine using things like for example ring superconductors and looking into the notion of

102
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,880
magnetism and so on. And then from there I continued to network and meet more people both

103
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:39,680
in the defense industry as well as in the private sector. And there seemed to be more and more

104
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,480
validity to what I was looking into. And I don't claim I was the first one to discover this by any

105
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,440
stretch. What were you before you had your experience? You had a podcast where you're

106
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,120
covering UFOs, is that right? Correct, correct. And so you were already somewhat interested in

107
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,360
kind of out there subjects, but nothing from a scientific perspective? Nothing. Since I was

108
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,680
young I always had an interest in you know the paranormal and things like that. But right,

109
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,760
nothing from the scientific aspect. Before the podcast I was in construction. It was pretty

110
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,840
straightforward. There was no, I don't have any formal degrees. So what inspired you to start a

111
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,200
UFO podcast as a construction worker? Well what happened was COVID had hit and this was during

112
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,440
the time when people had you know two three months off where they were staying home. And I said to

113
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,520
myself I looked around at the time at the UFO podcasting field from what I could find at least

114
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,480
and I could, with all due respect to the shows out there, I couldn't find a show that seemed to

115
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:40,080
be very unbiased and neutral and just looked at evidence rather than implementing a certain biased

116
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,880
perspective. And I thought maybe I could contribute to the field by just taking applying an open mind

117
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,960
to it. Now granted with that said that has significantly changed because of fantastic

118
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,480
shows like yourself and some others. But at the time that's what I was doing and so there came a

119
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,160
point where I just kind of got bored and I said I want to try and you know make something and

120
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,320
see what I could do dealing with electromagnetism in particular, what that could potentially lead

121
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,720
to. And how far into doing the podcast do you have this amazing blue being experience that prompts

122
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,360
you to get into quantum physics? Probably about just over a year in, maybe a year and a half.

123
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,880
So going to 2021 now give or take. Is there anything that happened before that experience

124
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,920
or just seemed like out of the blue and no pun intended? Literally no pun intended,

125
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,680
out of the blue entirely. Nothing preliminary that was before that. That's amazing. Okay so

126
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,320
you're prompted to look into both electrical engineering and kind of some more experimental

127
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,760
stuff but also some of the theory behind some of these more exotic lineages in science if you will.

128
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,480
And you say you get noticed, can you say anything more about that and no worries if you can?

129
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,680
Certain individuals that you've interviewed on your show noticed me and asked me to present

130
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,840
a couple of times over and they were very interested in what I had to say and that told me well

131
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,640
if you know if I'm on to something I clearly must be on to something semi-feasible at least

132
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,400
because if not why would there be this show of interest? And then from there essentially I began

133
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,600
networking more and more, meeting with different groups of people in the private military contractor

134
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,400
field, meeting with people inside the defense department and officially there was no way that

135
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:32,320
they could support me but privately they were encouraging me significantly to continue pursuing

136
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,120
what I was doing and so at this point in time now what I essentially do is I consult for private

137
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,480
groups as well as for in some cases other we'll just say private groups for different aspects

138
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,080
of physics and I don't claim to know a lot by any means compared to certain individuals out there

139
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,960
with regards to zero point energy but I think in a certain capacity I could probably hold my own

140
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,000
and so that's led me to where I am now and I'm very very fortunate and very grateful so.

141
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,360
Well I'll just say the reason we're even doing this is because I don't feel super equipped. I

142
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,240
mean we had an initial conversation a lot of what you said resonated on some instinctive level with

143
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,040
me and so I was like okay this guy seems you know pretty legit like this seems awesome like

144
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,520
what he's into seems directionally exactly aligned with a lot of intuitions I've had or even stuff

145
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,240
I've discovered just from a historical perspective when it comes to Townsend Brown or high energy

146
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,280
physics or certain anomalies with consciousness or whatever you were kind of saying a lot of

147
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,800
this stuff but taking it a little deeper as far as the math and theory of it but really what convinced

148
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,600
me is I don't know if you remember this but I was like okay I appreciate you know meeting you said

149
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,880
this is amazing but like you're a construction worker four years ago and you just got prompted

150
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,160
by a blue being to get into this. I will say that this will be controversial however I know

151
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,800
that you're not afraid of any of that. I started looking into because of what this being had

152
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,480
showed me during that one evening experience in a visual sense I started looking into this notion of

153
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,080
what people call longitudinal waves or longitudinal scalar waves now I know there's a lot of

154
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,360
misinformation and disinformation out there about it I know that we have mutual friends that are

155
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,680
currently conducting experiments looking into basically proving its feasibility and what it

156
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,040
could lead to and so on. And just for the audience so this is this idea of you know sometimes it's

157
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,080
called scalar physics other times it's called extended electrodynamics it's the idea that

158
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,920
classical electrodynamics as we currently hold it which only allows for the you know your typical

159
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,400
transverse hertzian electromagnetic wave which attenuates over spacetime electrons pair off

160
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,000
that sort of thing. You actually have this other thing called the scalar field which allows for

161
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,160
all sorts of exotic wave types where in the transverse hertzian wave you have you know

162
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,640
a electric field a magnetic field and wave propagation and all three are perpendicular

163
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,120
to one another and in this case you could have you know a magnetic field and you know wave

164
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,560
propagation they're parallel and so it could do you know all the you know attenuation over normal

165
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,760
distances in spacetime that sort of thing might get kind of negated by these exotic wave types.

166
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,920
Correct and so to your point very well said by the way these longitudinal waves were shown to me by

167
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,240
this being basically as slinky so to speak that that exists all around us but because of the way

168
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,240
that quantum theory explains it there or would explain it if there was any official way to that

169
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,280
would be allowed through the system to explain it they exist all around us in what we call I

170
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,920
guess you could say the quantum vacuum or what was once called the luminiferous ether many years ago

171
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,280
I think over a hundred years ago they exist all around us but they also don't simultaneously so

172
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:53,920
you need to in other words curve spacetime itself in order to tap in order to tap these type of

173
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,360
waves so you use the traditional um hertzian transverse waves that we're used to and accustomed

174
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,040
to but you apply certain conditions um in an engineering sense to them in which will allow

175
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,760
spacetime to curve now how do you do that this is where it's interesting and I will get into that

176
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:15,840
so essentially if I may start with a very basic foundation here everything that we that is taught

177
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,400
to my understanding within particle physics electrical engineering on a basic level are

178
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:26,400
have to do with what are called u1 models that essentially assume a flat spacetime so in other

179
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,000
words in the condition of a flat spacetime you cannot get these effects and if you begin to

180
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,800
curve spacetime itself which I'll explain practically you can start to see this certain

181
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,360
type of phenomenology that you otherwise would not see so what do I mean by that for example

182
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,760
the Aronoff-Bohm effect shows essentially that they're that potentials themselves

183
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,240
more formally called the four vector potentials are actually more fundamental than physical fields

184
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,920
and I don't think a lot I know there's a lot of people privately that grasp it even better than

185
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,920
I do but I think publicly there are a lot of people that truly don't see that because it

186
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,680
maybe seems too esoteric or too magical or what have you but the idea here is that essentially

187
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,360
the electromagnetic vector potential can allow for the uh essentially the curving of spacetime

188
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,040
in a topological sense so in the laboratory you energetically start to get these caduceus

189
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,640
like waves that occur longitudinally that don't that are initially start off in a transverse sense

190
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,840
now in a very simple regard one way that spacetime itself could be curved would be having to do with

191
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,360
spinning for example a capacitor if you will because what you're doing from a mechanical

192
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,920
perspective is you're inducing curvature within that local vicinity of spacetime now

193
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,600
I'm paraphrasing here and forgive me for those that are watching this later on where if you look

194
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,640
up the actual quote I may be a little bit wrong here but Feynman said something peculiar which

195
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,080
is that when you are charging a capacitor you start to see the sparks come in on the edges of

196
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,120
the gap of the actual capacitor instead of where you're charging it from which implies that there's

197
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,280
some type of kinetic momentum if you will within the quantum vacuum or the ether that is right in

198
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,920
front of us that we don't have take a certain perspective to in order to be able to see it for

199
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,640
what it could be or what it could lead to so for example people look at the Aronoff-Bohm effect and

200
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,600
they think well what does this mean well it's possible that by implementing a vector and scalar

201
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,240
potentials electromagnetically you can start to induce curved spacetime phenomenologies topologically

202
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,640
that otherwise you could not do with a flat spacetime metric so from a if I may say from a

203
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,640
chemistry perspective say you have an acid and a hydroxide and you neutralize the two in the

204
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,640
laboratory but what happens is you don't get any exothermic reaction in other words you don't get

205
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,720
any heat the standard u1 model that assumes a flat spacetime says you will always get heat

206
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,760
there's nothing wrong with that standard model under the assumption that spacetime is always flat

207
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,360
but if spacetime is curved it's possible that you may start to deal with negative entropy or

208
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,040
neg entropy rather than entropy or linear forward moving entropy as we now know it to be so what

209
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:18,560
that means is we start getting these waves and phenomena that would otherwise not be realizable

210
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:25,360
because when you curve spacetime you start to induce a a caduceus like effect what's caduceus

211
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,800
a caduceus meaning essentially like two waves like the the serpent the medical symbol the serpent

212
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,640
moving around the yeah uh a staff yeah so the the actual serpent itself would be representative

213
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,840
of the waves or the same way if you think of our our dna double helix yep so to speak um and so

214
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,720
what happens is is that when you're in the uh when you see these effects with this acid and

215
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,840
hydroxide it's possible that there may be a negative energy aspect that is occurring which

216
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,200
means that you may have electrical effects in that experiment where the electricity is cold

217
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,480
instead of hot and this start this this also overlaps directly in the uh to the field with

218
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,760
low energy nuclear reactions cold fusion and so it gets very interesting because you start

219
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,080
to realize that there are these vortex like geometries in the laboratory whether it's with

220
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,440
chemistry whether it's with electrical engineering or so on or particle physics that otherwise you

221
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,120
would not get if you assumed a flat spacetime so what happens is if somebody says a scientist

222
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,440
may come in and say oh that's just sulfuric acid i would beg to differ they it would be sulfuric

223
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,320
acid if you unkinked the spacetime topology that the curvature of spacetime itself allowed you to

224
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,040
induce now if you unkinked it if you think of basically just two you know chains locking into

225
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,560
each other if you unkink those those chains or those fields if you will now you're back to a flat

226
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,280
spacetime but if you're dealing with curving spacetime you start to get these phenomena

227
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,160
that otherwise you would not you would not expect and to my knowledge at least are not um are not

228
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,800
taught within within uh you know certain schools um and institutions and so ideally so as far as

229
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,400
producing these effects are you saying that spacetime itself is actually curved or are you

230
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,600
saying that uh you can use high electromagnetism to curve spacetime spacetime um it wants to be

231
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,680
curved it so in other words you have to um mechanically or artificially induce curvature

232
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,680
in it and you do that through electromagnetism you can i was talking to uh you know a scientist

233
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,680
named bob maguire do you know him i've heard of him and and you know he was talking about um

234
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,960
the stress energy tensor right in einstein's equations right and you know how sort of

235
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,920
conventionally in uh you know physics if you have enough electromagnetism you should be able to

236
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,400
curve spacetime but we really just know that that occurs through mass because you have like

237
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,480
you know planetary cosmology where there's sort of this inward gravitational force right but it

238
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,640
doesn't really feel like from an engineering perspective we have the ability to create

239
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,560
you know the enormous amount of electromagnetism in order to curve spacetime

240
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,360
what do you think i this is a great question i appreciate it so i would say that we actually

241
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,720
can and we have privately um as humans without even needing to look at any type of reverse

242
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,960
engineered programs although i'm sure you know if one is working on a project and they're given

243
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,960
access to reverse engineered legacy programs they'd be able to you know cross reference

244
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,080

believe that if you look at the work of salvatore paez so real quick when you say legacy so you

276
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,360
think that we do have ufos in our possession and we've like that's inspired a lot of modern

277
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,720
science i'm certain that we that there have been discoveries going back to the 50s that

278
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,520
humans have conducted from an experimental standpoint that have at the very least given

279
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,120
provided a proof of concept that show that we can induce these effects without and so do you not

280
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,080
believe like you know whistleblowers like david grush lou alazando who say that we have like

281
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,400
reverse engineering efforts within the government i i also believe that as well okay i believe that

282
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,240
as well i believe we're dealing with a mixed bag okay so to speak yeah i don't i don't take one

283
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,560
avenue i'm not a narrow-minded with regards to what i believe versus don't believe okay i think

284
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,520
we're dealing with a mixed bag and and and um so you're getting into sal paiz sal paiz for the

285
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:13,280
audience is a navy engineer who holds patents three extremely interesting patents

286
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,760
involving inertial mass reduction and you know exotic flight principles and that sort of thing

287
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,160
yes yes and i just interviewed him actually and so oh that's amazing yeah that's awesome that's

288
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,040
awesome he's he's a great guy he's a really good guy awesome guy i like him a lot yeah sensitive

289
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,320
oh he's a very very sweet guy very sweet guy um i think that to your question that we as humans

290
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,000
have made advancements um with regards to things like inertial mass reduction uh with regards to

291
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,640
things like the emission of high frequency gravitational waves um and if i could say very

292
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,960
quickly for the audience inertial mass reduction means you're basically reducing the mass of an

293
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,040
object so it begins to essentially fall up instead of the way that you would drop an object it begins

294
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,480
to essentially fall upwards because you're biasing the potentials of the mass of that object itself

295
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,520
and this is something that's been reported by you gain plakletin off and it's also and that goes

296
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,320
back to victor schauberger because his dad was actually a soviet agent that retrieved victor

297
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,320
schauberger's files yes and and but that also connects with this modern anti-gravity conspiracy

298
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,320
you have this woman named ning li who's at you know university of alabama huntsville and she

299
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,920
claims to have a mass reduction effect over a spinning superconductor and so you do you

300
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,480
basically believe both of those accounts i think there's there may be something there

301
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,280
with plakletin off um forgive me i have to be careful with regards to what i say about ning

302
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,720
li but what i can say about that is that um there is evidence of which i'd be happy to provide to

303
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,800
you afterwards where in the early 2000s she had sent an email to i i forgot who it was exactly

304
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,200
someone in the alternative propulsion community where she claimed she had generated about 11

305
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,080
kilowatts of high frequency gravitational waves well um the email messaging was then

306
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,640
intercepted by an ip address from west point and then from there you never heard from her again

307
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,360
um i know from there she wins this you know top secret military contract she gets a clearance

308
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,000
correct and yeah she she kind of falls off the face of the earth she leaves the university of

309
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,200
alabama huntsville yep you could just say oh her work fell off she was a quack or whatever but then

310
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,640
we found out since that larry smalley who was the head of the physics department at university of

311
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,680
alabama huntsville yep goes and joins her and larry smalley his name is on a patent in 2004

312
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,920
that basically involves uh an asymmetric barrel shaped capacitor and it's for nasa right and it

313
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,400
connects all the way back to towns and browns work and that was like the original kind of

314
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,080
anti-gravity guy who was using capacitors to exactly maybe manipulate space top exactly i

315
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,040
believe if i'm not mistaken ning lee was actually more focused on superconductors in a solid state

316
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:02,400
sense i know initially in the 90s she was collecting data on ring superconductors but i believe the

317
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,200
issue with spinning it after a certain threshold was that the the disks the the rings would begin

318
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,720
to break so i know she was looking into a more solid state aspect however there is a paper

319
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,400
that was released by bob baker under the miter corporation for one of the high frequency

320
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:24,400
gravitational wave conferences where you cannot actually access the entire paper just the abstract

321
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,240
introduction where i'm paraphrasing but bob baker talks about he's now since deceased but

322
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,520
he talked about how ning lee was able to generate up to 11 kilowatts of gravitational waves and

323
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,880
essentially there were two types of gravity that she had discovered which was ac gravity and dc

324
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,400
gravity so a static type of gravity and then an alternating current type of gravity under the notion

325
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:54,000
that gravity comes from the topological displacement of of matter topologies meaning essentially

326
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,920
you can use electromagnetism in a certain format in which would then at the next level above through

327
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:06,160
the curving of space time allow you to control gravity electromagnetically whoa wait explain

328
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,840
that and it's interesting you say two types of gravity because that comes up a lot

329
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,720
well you can also correlate that too and this is for your viewers and yourself to decide for

330
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,520
yourself to mr lazarez gravity a wave and b wave that's what i was going to bring up ac

331
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,520
ac gravity dc gravity it's possible my take on lazarez he was kind of a you know it's bob lazar

332
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,400
is but i mean the audience is definitely going to know who he is but like he claimed to have

333
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,240
worked at s4 area 51 reverse engineering ufos right and he also came out saying some interesting

334
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,040
things about the flight principles that these you know crafts used right and he talks about

335
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:47,120
two forms of gravity gravity a and gravity b right and i kind of have come to the conclusion

336
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,760
after researching lazar for a while that he was a limited hangout of a person right so like i think

337
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,840
this guy john lear who was cia affiliated right pushed him out to george napp and that for

338
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,800
whatever reason the powers that be wanted lazar out right but they wanted him out because i don't

339
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,960
think he had a super sophisticated theoretical physics understanding i think he had like more

340
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,320
of like a engineering topological physics i agree and so you have these you know it's almost like

341
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,120
gravity gravity a gravity b that's not saying too much right but if you're smart enough right

342
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,480
maybe you can get initiated or something figure that out right and that's why i say again i myself

343
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,320
am still uh 50 50 as to where i stand with the entire story of mr lazar um but i do think that

344
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,320
there are interesting correlations between what he claimed was the a and b wave and then

345
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,960
ning lee's ac and dc gravity waves so what are these two forms of gravity how do they work

346
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,400
so uh basically you have dc gravity that allegedly at least according to the the very

347
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,040
general abstract of her report and forgive me because um i can't really expand past this point

348
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,240
however the idea is that there's a static type of gravitational wave that does not depend on the

349
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,360
square root of the electric permittivity but rather depends on the strength of the source of

350
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,240
the magneto static field in which it's coming from and then there's ac gravity which is far

351
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,680
stronger and is is not static in any capacity it is it is something that you would utilize in a

352
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:16,240
pulsed base scenario in which would actually if you were to view its geometry would emit um the

353
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,040
same way that are uh in the same geometry that are uh that a caduceus or double helix would

354
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,520
interesting and then what gravitons gravitons correct for gravity particles right now i say

355
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,760
that because i think the term gravitons is still controversial in mainstream science however

356
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,480
there are papers that have since that were funded by the miter corporation going back 20 25 years

357
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,560
that show that gravitons were both very high frequency and extremely low frequency gravitons

358
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:48,320
were detectable near the earth's atmosphere now where why that hasn't been more publicly stated i

359
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,280
don't know i'd be happy to provide you the documents privately i also know that the soviets

360
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,000
before the soviet union fell were looking into uh essentially the notion that einstein's general

361
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:06,000
relativity was a very rudimentary static um uh understanding of space time itself um i know

362
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,120
einstein himself flip-flopped on the notion of the quantum vacuum or the ether yeah he first i think

363
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,840
he was for it then he was against it then for it then against it and i i'm not sure you know there's

364
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,080
rumors that he worked with nicola tesla before he passed as to whether that could be substantiated

365
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,400
or not i i don't know i wasn't around at the time well he definitely i think early on with special

366
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,440
relativity you know he was like relativity is not compatible with the ether and then i think in 1921

367
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,560
ish time frame right right he then says actually general relativity is compatible with the ether

368
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,880
but it was sort of silent people forgot about it correct and then you have quantum electrodynamics

369
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,360
and Feynman later and like the you know the vacuum of space is filled with energy and so he's kind

370
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,320
of like reinstantiating the ether sort of i think so i think so yeah but i want i want to get back

371
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,600
to gravitons sure because there's a really interesting article from 1956 called the g

372
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,320
engines are coming or something like that by this guy michael gladich and yes you know it's it's

373
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,040
all about how we have all these vital anti-gravity programs those anti-gravity programs are kind of

374
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,280
analogous to our atomic programs right and we're going to beat gravity and it's right around the

375
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:16,000
bend and uh in it is quoted i believe two scientists at princeton stanley desser and

376
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,240
okay it says these guys are working with we figured out g particles gravity particles

377
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,200
right and i find that to be such an interesting part of the article that like nobody really talks

378
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,000
about is like these guys are talking about gravity particles right exactly the all these um all these

379
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,720
publications and and whether it was in the literature or newspapers uh going back to the

380
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,640
1950s all the way to the 70s i've always said as i said to privately once the late 1970s hit there

381
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:48,160
are some papers still that came out in the 80s dealing with spinning gyroscopes with certain

382
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,680
electrical and other components applied to them where the spinning gyroscope would lose its uh

383
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:59,040
would lose some of its mass and then when the gyroscope was turned towards the earth's axis

384
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,520
or against the earth's axis depending which way you pointed it it would gain some of the mass back

385
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,320
so in other words it was conducted in magnetically shielded laboratories it was shown for example

386
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,080
that certain effects would occur that were that were not artifacts experimentally that could not

387
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:23,840
be ruled out um wow yeah so yeah how does doing all this stuff yeah how how did how does doing

388
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:31,600
these experiments allow for mass reduction the ideas that you can exchange now this is where

389
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:36,400
it becomes very esoteric but the idea is that you can exchange the internal mass of an object

390
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,680
um with the local environment or the local space time itself so the notion that energy cannot be

391
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,920
created or destroyed would be correct you're just basically cycling that energy in and out from the

392
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,800
object because of spin coupled to an electromagnetic induction field combined with uh something else

393
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,440
that i'll tell you off the air that that would that would allegedly prove this to or show at

394
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,080
least proof of concept that there would be mass reduction um and this is the work of salvatore

395
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:09,120
where he's saying that like if you couple spin with these specific electromagnetic charges

396
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,720
you can break the swinger limit you get this runaway the right now the idea is with regard

397
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,400
the the the swinger limit is essentially a very simply put the notion that after a certain um

398
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,040
threshold of uh electromagnetically uh the vacuum becomes non-linear yes so to speak i think it was

399
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:33,120
i forgot what it was 10 to the power of eight i don't want to say and hal putoff talks about

400
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,760
electrically polarizable vacuums as well so it's like i'm a big proponent of that and and then

401
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,440
you have this speech from jim rider who's a lockheed martin space systems guy who we now know tried to

402
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:50,080
transfer a quote unquote ufo to bigelow aerospace in 2008 according to lou alzano a bunch of other

403
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,800
people right and he's he talks about an electrically polarizable vacuum as well and maybe an interesting

404
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,080
analogy for the audience if you're like me and an idiot when it comes to this stuff uh like if you

405
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:06,320
had like a bat like a plastic bag with water in it right and you were to like press down on one side

406
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,760
that would be sort of electrically polarizing the vacuum and maybe you could surf space time as

407
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,760
right the same way a surfer surfs on water yeah water waves correct if we say there's a little

408
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,880
surfer figurine on the bag or whatever it surfs down exactly exactly and now that would be using

409
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,000
that would be using vacuum polarization as dr putoff i believe has a fantastic paper on

410
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,960
space time metric engineering excuse me that shows that now if i could clarify

411
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,360
as i understand it that is a little bit different than actually having a device that would emit

412
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:43,520
through pulsed based uh systems um high frequency gravitational waves however the physics are are

413
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,680
indeed interconnected uh very much so and and how do you get to a thing that emits high frequency

414
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,120
gravitational waves well there's there's speculation that very intense lasers could do it in um in

415
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:01,360
what's considered like a hall room array uh there's speculation that um uh you can use this is very

416
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:07,200
controversial but you can use superconductors to do it um there are speculation for example that

417
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,080
you could use certain geometrical setup of superconductors that could induce these effects

418
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:18,240
let's put it that way yeah interesting yeah so what useful stuff can you do it because we're

419
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,680
speaking really abstractly right now sure what can you do that changes the world with any of these

420
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,520
things you can essentially this is forgive me because this is where i'm going to have to be

421
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,560
careful but you can essentially do things for example from an energy perspective where maybe

422
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,480
and i say this speculatively it's possible that you can output more energy in a device than you're

423
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,240
inputting okay um which would imply coefficient of performance over one um which would violate the

424
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,640
second law of thermodynamics and there would need to be a readjustment to the law of conservation

425
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,520
of energy uh because you're dealing with a larger open system so if you implement the vacuum and the

426
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,640
vector and scalar potentials into your equations you could it would actually be feasible um the

427
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,920
second law of thermodynamics uh it would be completely violated because again it's possible

428
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,720
in these cases we would be dealing in some cases with electrical currents that are cold instead of

429
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,160
hot which is very controversial to say um that would be one aspect another aspect would be for

430
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:22,160
example the ability if for example as we see with dr halpudov's uh invention um where he had he's

431
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,840
using vector and scalar potentials to communicate that would be an extreme that is an extreme uh

432
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:33,040
breakthrough in revolution um another example would be the work of salpaez for example in which

433
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,400
you see that you could have craft that could basically be a a transmedium type of craft that

434
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:45,680
could go through water air etc without as if the water air didn't exist because the field around

435
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,200
the craft itself is voiding the the reality of space time itself as controversial as that is

436
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:59,600
so free energy uh building real ufos basically like exotic propulsion to the limit right and

437
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:05,440
then exotic communications as well correct that traverses space time and and even even healing

438
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,840
medical aspects that are again for example sorry to cut you off but um luke montagnier

439
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:15,440
his dna water teleportation uh paper do you believe that because i i've always found that

440
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:22,320
so this is by the way french nobel prize winner who discovered uh the genome for hiv right and

441
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,040
so he was lauded for that after that in his career he started getting this really interesting trippy

442
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,400
ideas one of which was that there are these aqueous nanostructures in dna that involve

443
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:39,920
communication semantic communication transfer and and um storage basically of information

444
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,960
right and he was kind of laughed out of the room from a conventional science perspective but you

445
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,800
think there's something i i strongly i would i'm not a gambler but i would bet money there's

446
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,120
something there you know i've always been sympathetic to it why why do you think there's

447
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:59,760
money there and then i can tell you why i'm interested um experiments i've witnessed

448
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,480
interesting yeah can you say anything more um unfortunately no one forgive me because i don't

449
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,040
mean to be like i i don't want to be overly vague well i can speak for you have you ever

450
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:15,120
heard of constantin mile i have okay so he's in the black forest in germany and he deals with

451
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:20,960
extended electrodynamics but from a kind of biological systems perspective right right and

452
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,720
he writes about dna resonance with you know specific longitudinal scalar longitudinal waves

453
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,720
actually one of the scalar waves is called heliochoidal right and so you might think you

454
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:39,360
know uh if if form follows function or function follows form that um you know if you have these

455
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:44,320
wave types that basically look like dna maybe they're meant for dna to be the receivers right

456
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:50,880
so there's also another guy named andre puharich who was very interested in extended electrodynamics

457
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,920
or extremely low frequencies and how they would affect kind of brain waves and and even semantic

458
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,480
information right and i if i could say i would dare to argue that all of what word we've been

459
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,760
discussing from the propulsion aspect all the way to the communications to the biological to the

460
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,760
energy aspect all deal with these longitudinal waves in some capacity or another there is a

461
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,560
harmonic component there's a sound component that has been completely um removed from uh the

462
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,400
teachings of of electrical engineering that in some aspects do exist in some uh institutions

463
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,160
regarding particle physics but um it essentially deals with an asymmetry within space time itself

464
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,400
that you could induce um through for example things like superconducting uh resonance circuits

465
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,560
or tank circuits as they're called um and certain avenues going down that road i do forgive me i do

466
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:49,600
have to be careful uh but yes there may be some resonance may be a significant aspect all of this

467
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:56,560
what is uh an aspect of this technology that we can speak about that you think will help the most

468
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,600
amount of people and be the least dangerous as far as describing the actual nuts and bolts

469
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:06,480
components of how it works because i'd love to get into like sure how some of these things

470
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,880
work close to the metal but i realize they're you know national security sensitivities and what i

471
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,640
you've now you haven't told me anything but my what i picked up from you know you came across

472
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,200
you know certain people uh entered your life or you came on their radar or whatever is that

473
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,320
when maybe you got these interesting downloads around science you were maybe you were maybe

474
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:31,280
tapped by people who are kind of in and around government circles right be my guess but that

475
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,480
that is correct yes um something uh well what's interesting is that i think uh without bringing

476
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,440
it up too too often i think that sal paez's patents and his work have been by far the most

477
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:48,000
revealing aspect of what propulsion uh could be applied to with regards to um essentially again

478
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,160
reducing the mass of an object and so on but i also think that um see this is the this and this is

479
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:02,960
where i'll be very blunt i i believe that this talk of metamaterials it's not that metamaterials

480
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,680
are are bad or are don't work or are a psyop not at all i think that they have a very fundamental

481
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,040
place in in in the field of physics and materials engineering absolutely however i think that there

482
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,840
has been and this is not towards any one individual in particular but there has been a narrative

483
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:26,080
pushed with respect to not discussing that you can use basic materials that we already have and

484
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,960
have known about for decades combined with electromagnetism to induce some of these effects

485
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,400
whether it's energy communication propulsion i think it's because some of these solutions

486
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,320
again taken with a certain perspective with a different perspective on old physics in some

487
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:47,760
cases could be so simple to engineer in some cases if one had access to you know a decent

488
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,880
amount of funding that it it is threatening to people that are looking to suppress this

489
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:59,440
so you think the alien narrative is sometimes tech protection is i believe there is a legitimate

490
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,920
aspect to it but i think in some cases yes so yeah i i hear that and then it's just extremely

491
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,480
confusing every time i'm like oh maybe it's just anti-gravity shit i'm like right i'll give you a

492
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,840
good example okay so like towns and brown is this mid-century anti-gravity guy i think he got like

493
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,640
really far you know made a documentary about him right and which was great oh thank you man

494
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:27,040
and uh he uh you know talks about a couple of materials so magnesium bismuth barium titanate

495
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,400
right um they're what's called high k dielectric so we have a high k factor you can store a lot of

496
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,440
electromagnetic charge right his experiment which involves a capacitor so negatively charged plate

497
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,320
positively charged plate you have to put this neutral insulator in between right and that has

498
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:47,920
a high when it has a high k factor you get more thrust so you pump electromagnetism into the whole

499
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:53,680
thing and you get this thrust from negative to positive right and so you know that in a way that

500
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,320
beats gravity so it's this exciting thing so he talks about magnesium bismuth barium titanate

501
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:03,840
and then you go i've interviewed gary nolan too stanford professor and he you know claims that

502
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,800
he has ufo crash parts that he received from jacques valet and it's magnesium bismuth right

503
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,560
right and so i'm like well maybe it's just anti-gravity or whatever right but then you

504
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:18,400
go deeper into towns and brown you realize that he started nightcap which is the first civilian ufo

505
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:25,200
tracking program in 1956 you could say that was just you know doing civilian counter intel for

506
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,120
you know like american anti-gravity crafts but you learn about these early stories from like you know

507
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,960
around the time that like dart before like the late 50s early 60s where he would go into the

508
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,880
field and and find stuff flashes credentials do crash retrievals basically and like he found this

509
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,520
green fireball thing and it was losing mass and apparently that was barium titanate and then he

510
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,400
himself had a ufo experience that inspired a lot of his work kind of like your thing interesting

511
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,840
so the whole thing gets weird where the second you're like maybe it's just anti-gravity stuff

512
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,360
you trip out and you're like i don't know i think it becomes yeah it starts to get very very to your

513
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,560
point it starts to get very very interesting because i think that it at this point in time

514
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:14,160
i think when we if there's a sighting of a uap i think that most of the time it's hard to tell

515
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,680
if that is human made whether a pure human the source of pure human ingenuity or whether it's a

516
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,360
little bit of that mixed with reverse engineering aspects or if it's something

517
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:29,920
or someone else entirely what i will say though is i think we need to look into high voltage

518
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,600
experiments that normally that tesla was was playing with that people these days seem to

519
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:43,120
not be interested in i think that why high voltage i think high voltage induces a polarizable effect

520
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:47,840
within the local vacuum wherever that voltage is being applied for example there was something

521
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:54,240
called the ebner effect i believe in the 1990s you can i can send you the details to this afterwards

522
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,240
dealing with essentially there was a small documentary put together i forgot from which

523
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,960
country in europe but essentially when extremely high voltage it was like half a million volts or

524
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,480
more were applied to crops they were growing in ways that the farmers had not seen ever

525
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,680
and so i think this is where it starts to get again very esoteric but the notion is that

526
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:19,840
the ether of the quantum vacuum has within it memory that are stored within these potentials

527
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:25,360
and these potentials when practically induced using high voltage could in fact enable a form

528
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:32,320
of vacuum polarization that can apply to biological systems propulsive systems communication systems

529
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,440
and so on and so forth in a way that we would not be able to detect or understand with our

530
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,320
current means of technological development it's for this is pretty freaky it feels like playing

531
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,040
god a little bit because yeah you're talking about how matter even comes to form or something

532
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,760
right first place right and like it's interesting you say that about high voltages you know half

533
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,760
million volts or whatever applied to plants you know towns and brown was extremely interested

534
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,640
in electro culture as well we lived on hawaiian would do all these experiments around you know

535
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,960
having plants grow in specific ways right electro culture yes um and and i look at the work of towns

536
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:13,600
and brown and tesla and they're very similar like what tesla was doing at wardenclyffe high voltages

537
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,720
short distances right where he's claiming to tap the ether for free energy seems to be somewhat

538
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,520
similar to what towns and brown i i agree and i think one of the things as we discussed earlier

539
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,480
before we started recording is that i think one of the concerns for in groups or elements that

540
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,440
don't want this to be discussed or come out is that or be disclosed in any capacity is that

541
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,240
once you open this can of worms it opens up a whole other set of discoveries

542
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,720
that people would otherwise not know that people would generally not notice unless they knew

543
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:49,680
that there's a form of um asymmetry in the vacuum using potentials that could be induced

544
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:55,040
to to create what is called higher symmetry electromagnetics using a vector and scalar

545
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,840
potentials and so i think that what starts happening is you start dealing with things

546
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,960
like again negative energy so cold electricity so cold currents for example so you get frost

547
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,360
bite if you if you were to touch a a wire with it with cold currents rather than you know as

548
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,440
normally now you get burned if you touch a wire that's got electrical currents would that allow

549
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:22,400
because i think about extremely cold you know circuits or materials right and you hear this

550
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,240
theory that maybe you know ufos or man-made you know crafts or whatever that exhibit these exotic

551
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,160
flight principles might be sort of acting like quantum macroscopic objects i agree as you know

552
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:39,040
i'm always on the hunt for things that help me stay sharp focused and full of energy while i'm

553
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,800
diving into life's mysteries and making this show happen and i've got to say mud water has completely

554
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,640
transformed my mornings back in the day i used to struggle with that post-coffee crash and let's

555
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:57,200
not even get into the caffeine jitters mud water gave me the smooth steady energy i was missing

556
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:03,120
it's packed with functional mushrooms like lion's mane chaga and reishi plus turmeric and cacao

557
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:08,960
all working together to keep me focused calm and grounded honestly it's like coffee went on a yoga

558
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:15,200
retreat and came back zen what i love most is that it's not just about replacing coffee it's a whole

559
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:21,440
new ritual it's a simple nourishing way to start the day and i actually look forward to it every

560
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:28,720
morning every ingredient is usda certified organic vegan non-gmo and there's zero sugar

568
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:21,920
and so so uh to maintain quantum coherence like typically you need to be like you know extremely

569
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,680
cold or well i'm a big fan i'm a big proponent of the neils bohr model of the atom neils bohr

570
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,920
believed that superconductors were macroscopic atoms you told me that once and i blew my mind

571
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:40,320
what does that mean so the it's possible that superconductors could exhibit very um uh

572
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:45,840
quanta coherence quantum coherence that otherwise would normally be observed at the

573
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:51,200
plank scale or slightly above i think there's an entire aspect to superconductors including

574
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,440
things like the meissner effect and flux pinning that a lot of people just don't understand that

575
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,640
is right in their faces that if they truly viewed it in a different way could induce the type of

576
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,400
effects that we're discussing whether it's again you know the energy stuff the communication stuff

577
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,640
the propulsion stuff and so on and so forth and what i mean by that is when it comes to

578
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,920
superconductors the traditional theory that's referenced is the bard and cooper schaefer theory

579
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,600
called bcs theory i believe they all three of these gentlemen won a nobel prize for it

580
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:22,560
what that has left out as to whether this was conspiratorial or not i genuinely don't know

581
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:28,000
but what has been left out is has been dealing with lattice holes within superconductors so again

582
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,840
if you can polarize the lattice of a superconductor again we go back to polarization dr putoff's

583
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:38,640
polarizable vacuum approach and so on if we polarize the lattice of a superconductor or

584
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:44,160
of a metal of some sort it's possible we can start to get effects that would in fact again when other

585
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,120
engineering conditions are applied to the superconductor manipulate light manipulate

586
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:54,160
gravity and so on there was a paper from 1992 with douglas torning lee that showed that the

587
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,120
quantization for angular momentum in superconductors resides within the lattice holes of the

588
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,360
superconductor and not the cooper pairs the cooper pairs are attributed to the bcs

589
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:09,280
bard and cooper schaefer theory wow and so there's an entire little thrown out pocket of this that i

590
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,840
think should be looked at much more strongly and so how do you maintain coherence through the

591
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,160
lattice holes because you know i think about low temperature superconductors and cooper pairs and

592
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,560
right there are ways to explain that how do you explain that kind of deterministically uh well

593
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:28,400
essentially geometry a well you polarize the lattice but then the superconductor itself

594
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:34,480
maybe it's conical maybe it's cylindrical maybe it's a ring so to speak if you were to engineer

595
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,840
something that would that would match or fit or abide by the longitudinal waves if you were to

596
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:44,960
envision these slinkies all around us it's possible you may start to see effects that you otherwise

597
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,240
would not if you were dealing with just a square superconductor for example um it's possible that

598
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:55,520
these these effects may geometry is everything in my opinion when it comes to materials engineering

599
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:01,680
geometry is everything and so i think that you can witness certain effects in the laboratory with

600
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,400
you know four or five thousand dollars worth of experiment worth of material that if the

601
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:12,080
superconductor was not a ring superconductor if it was say a puck with no hole in it in the center

602
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:16,960
or it was a square superconductor um you would not see unless it were a ring superconductor

603
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,560
um it's possible again that these longitudinal waves are vortex-like in nature as well

604
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:27,760
so we need to materially engineer something that would abide by the geometry of what this

605
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,720
structure of these longitudinal waves are so that these transverse hertzian waves can then

606
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:40,640
overlap with one another and then create basically tap the um the vacuum fluctuations of the scalar

607
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:46,240
field that would other that otherwise you would not be able to do if hopefully that's an adequate

608
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:54,240
a lot of structures are like geometric inductors to convert electromagnetic waves to correct

609
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:59,520
the actual fabric of space time right correct so the idea is that like for generating high

610
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,800
frequency gravitational waves for example you need to oscillate the mass of a quadrupole a quadrupole

611
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:09,760
is when you have two dipoles that a dipole is a is the space between two atoms with a positive

612
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,840
and a negative charge the idea is that a quadrupole when you oscillate that you you can actually emit

613
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:22,800
gravitational waves from it now the if you could do it using superconductors and i say that carefully

614
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:29,040
if it would be in a very low energy format so you would not you would not like induce a you know

615
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,760
emit gravitons that would you know break a door down or something but if you could find a way

616
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,080
to pair that with the strong nuclear force then you may be able to and i i also again believe

617
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:44,240
that's what uh dr payez's some of his work was trying to allude to wow okay so you have these

618
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:52,240
lattice structures right in these conductive materials right and that allows for electromagnetism

619
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:57,840
to sort of interact with space time in exotic ways geometrically right so we initially talked

620
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:03,200
about spinning you know a capacitor which would be a mechanical version but a solid state version

621
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:10,160
would be using a superconductor in for example immersed in liquid helium for example liquid

622
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,480
helium is far more effective to induce these effects effects compared to liquid nitrogen

623
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:20,640
but the idea would be that the electrons move along a path that they normal that is asymmetrical

624
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,760
because the lattice is asymmetrical because when you polarize the lattice you induce you break the

625
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,960
symmetry of that lattice so you get now these non-linear effects that if we go back to when

626
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:37,200
we first started talking when when a lattice is symmetrical it is basically abiding by a flat

627
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:43,680
static space time when a lattice is now asymmetrical you're curving space time the

628
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,160
electrons start to move in a non-linear sense so when you break the lattice then you're having

629
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:54,880
the electrons move in this non-linear way when you break the symmetry of any particle field

630
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,280
no i shouldn't say particle field when you i have to watch my words here forgive me when you break

631
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:05,840
the symmetry of space time itself and in some cases that would be polarizing the lattice of

632
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:12,080
a superconductor for example you can get these non-linear effects that are the result of

633
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:20,080
electromagnetic induction but become become something else entirely topologically fascinating

634
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:26,560
so what does it become that's different topologically at that point you can start

635
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:31,600
to bend light you can start to have this pairing of electricity and gravity this goes back to the

636
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:36,560
the missing heavy side equations i know there's a lot of controversy surrounding

637
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:42,960
did heavy side butcher maxwell's equations or not it is i can what i can say is that it is well known

638
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:49,200
to my knowledge behind the scenes that there's an entire heavy side component that misses that

639
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:55,600
basically misses a circuit from an engineering aspect now what i mean by that is back in the

640
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:02,640
early 1900s heinrich lorenz he did something that was called symmetrical regaging of maxwell's

641
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,960
quaternions because maxwell was told you're not going to be able to get your quaternions across

642
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,000
to the engineers at the time which had the education of electricians today so you have

643
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,240
to chop it and get it simpler you have to only deal with the right angle vector and nothing

644
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,160
outside of that vector field basically and what's outside of that vector field the scalar potentials

645
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,440
now essentially what happened was lorenz threw the baby out with the bathwater again i don't know

646
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:34,000
if this was a you know conspiracy or not i don't i wasn't there at the time but the entire lorenz

647
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:42,800
regaging aspect has basically um how can i put it stagnated the the mainstream field of of particle

648
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:50,640
physics and for the audience the lorenz equation is the sum of the vector and scalar potentials

649
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:57,040
and lorenz sets this to zero right correct what he did was he played a clever trick when he chopped

650
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:02,480
up maxwell's quaternions and for the audience if i may say in a very simple manner say you say to

651
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:09,040
me dave let's order a pizza the pizza comes and i say to you there's 12 slices but i say to you

652
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:13,840
jesse there's only one slice and you go dave what do you mean there's another 11 slices and i go no

653
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:19,760
no no ignore the 11 there's just one that's basically what lorenz did wow that's i'm in

654
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:25,040
a very simple regard that's basically what lorenz did now by doing that he played a clever trick he

655
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:31,040
said and i quote he didn't deny that the energy outside the vector field existed he didn't deny

656
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:36,000
that the scalar potentials existed but what he said was and i quote they have no physical

657
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,240
significance that's basically it's like it's basically saying that you you're throwing the

658
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:46,720
baby out with the bathwater and i know that there was um forgot who said this but it's like saying

659
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:51,600
we have a boat right on the water and we have all this wind around the boat but the wind is

660
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:56,720
not touching our boat it's not pushing our sail so what so well it's a problem because theory is

661
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,680
supposed to be a descriptor of ontological reality right to the extent that it can be and you believe

662
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,080
science can be a descriptor of reality right it's an attempt at that it should never be

663
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:12,640
narrowly confined to present engineering capabilities because in the future engineering

664
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:17,360
capabilities will always you know be get that much more amazing so you do all these exotic

665
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:22,720
things with materials in the 1970s and 80s that you couldn't you know in the 1890s i couldn't

666
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:28,000
agree more you don't want to like constrain that within an equation exactly and i do believe with

667
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,240
the utmost respect to theorists although i i know for a fact behind the scenes the theory is well

668
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:38,720
understood and top theorists understand this um with that said i do believe that there are certain

669
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:45,280
calculations within theoretical physics that may seem very miniscule or may seem like an artifact

670
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,840
at first but when if you could take those equations and apply a form of practical

671
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:55,920
engineering to it you would get phenomena that would then um force the theorists to

672
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,600
readjust their model to the new phenomena that you see in the lab theory itself is not going to take

673
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,680
like like Feynman said it best and he was a theorist he said i don't care how beautiful your

674
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:11,840
theory is how eloquent it seems if it can't be engineered it's wrong if it can't be experimentally

675
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:17,760
verified it's wrong and so i think that as we know richard feinman and john wheeler calculated

676
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,080
there's enough energy inside the size of a coffee cup to evaporate all of the world's oceans if you

677
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:26,720
could practically get it up in there at first they thought it was an artifact of the mathematics

678
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:33,200
but it turns out that it's not and so basically when lorenz resymmetrized the the the maxwell's

679
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:38,800
quaternions he completely removed all the potentials dealing with the outside of the

680
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:44,160
right angle vector the vector field itself and so i think that this has to do with for example

681
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,240
dr putoff's vector and scalar potential communication where there are no e and b

682
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:54,160
fields but you have toroidal geometries that exist in which you can transmit information

683
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:59,760
through um topological infolding and out folding as david bohm used to call it basically the idea

684
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:05,600
that if you have a particle inside that part that particle is made up of smaller versions

685
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:10,800
of the same particle so in other words fractals that tend to fold in and out geometrically if you

686
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:16,000
could electromagnetically create such an effect in that regard and these potentials may be able

687
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,440
to enable that there's a lockheed martin patent called a coherent matter wave beam that deals

688
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:26,400
with using the erinoff bohm effect basically using the potentials themselves not the fields

689
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:33,040
but the potentials to cohere matter itself in a way that would basically

690
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:39,040
self-organize the particles was yeah so there's a lot there that we program matter or something

691
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:43,520
like how do you do that well that's the thing the idea is that spacetime itself is a i say this

692
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:49,280
carefully a living structure that has memory and so what happens is is if you can induce these

693
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:54,000
vector and scalar potentials in an engineering sense you start to witness geometries that would

694
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,440
otherwise you would not be able to notice with the standard hertzian waves in an in an engineering

695
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,960
regard i know that that's very controversial to theorists although i i know theorists behind the

696
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:10,480
scenes that are that openly say no this has been known for decades very in a very confidential

697
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:16,880
regard so okay let's get really specific with the put off stuff sure he's talking about quantum

698
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:22,960
communications via these uh scalar and vector potentials correct correct so how do you do that

699
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:28,560
so i think about like a classic example with a limit to a transverse hertzian wave is you're

700
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:35,040
trying to do undersea communications you have a perpendicular you know magnetic field a b field

701
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:40,480
and you know as a result of that you're going to get a lot of electron pair off in a you know very

702
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:45,120
fast decay function on any sort of signal sent out underwater right how do you get around that

703
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:49,600
with something like you know put offs it's possible like we talked about voltage focusing

704
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:55,920
purely on voltage um focusing on um acoustic resonance but specifically like what would you

705
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,720
do like how would you i think there are certain things that if you if you used voltage and pulsed

706
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:07,200
the superconductor for example you would be able to a transmit information in a non-linear regard

707
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:13,920
that otherwise if you that otherwise would not be possible uh using e and b fields okay if speaking

708
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:22,480
high level yeah yeah um i think that um pulsing superconductors with pure voltage is is very

709
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,640
interesting have you heard the term topological insulator absolutely so this is something i'm

710
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:34,000
just learning about because i have a friend who kind of works in some sensitive areas in

711
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,440
national security he goes pseudonymously by the name jack and we've started to interview you know

712
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,840
do the technical series together and speak to people who are honestly above my pay grade when

713
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,840
it comes to science like he helped me out on the pious interview for example oh amazing okay and

714
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:53,840
um he talks about these topological insulators these materials that barium titanate magnesium

715
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:59,920
bismuth are examples of yep is is that the type of superconductor that if you pulse you might be

716
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,880
able to engage in some sort of quantum comms with uh that and also there are multiple ways to skin

717
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,400
this cat that's the thing everything we've been talking about there are multiple ways to pursue

718
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,520
this however i think whether it's barium titanate whether it's yttrium barium copper oxide there's

719
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:19,520
a couple of uh low temperature superconductors with high temperature combinations using voltage

720
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:26,560
and acoustic resonance could in fact be able to transmit information that never decays um that

721
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:30,960
would i don't mean for the record i don't mean to speak for dr putoff but i i find his work

722
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,560
absolutely fascinating his entire set of papers on his earth tech website is every is uh acted

723
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:44,240
as a mentor type guide to me uh yeah there are things there that are revolutionary in a way that

724
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:50,400
is like it it it would break people's minds with regards to wait you're telling me that this type

725
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:56,960
of approach can be taken and all of a sudden we get these effects that we're that are considered

726
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,920
beyond the pale uh from a mainstream sense how should we view this from a because like from a

727
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:07,040
pure like science and civilian sector right you know you're telling me that you have these quantum

728
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:13,200
comms that like don't decay over space time you know that seems like the way an advanced alien

729
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:18,800
race would communicate that seems like it would be this massive exciting unlock for society how

730
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:23,840
do we view this from a national security perspective because i tried to get in touch with a guy named

731
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:30,960
lee hiveley who's you know working in extended electrodynamics and a friend that uh you know

732
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:37,200
helped with facilitate that you know he got in trouble yeah hively freaked out and was like you

733
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,040
know you shouldn't be shouldn't be reaching out to me and i think he put like the you know navy

734
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:45,120
press or something on the thread yep and i was just like hey man i just wanted to have a

735
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:50,800
conversation and 99 of you know my stuff is is offline right and i always say publicly if i'm

736
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:56,960
told that for serious national security purposes i should stop covering a specific thing i will

737
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:02,080
always do it right right and anyway so but i usually don't get the door shut in my face but

738
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:06,640
i did with highly i can give you an extended electrodynamics well i can give you an example

739
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,880
of what this vector and scalar potentials could do other than communication that would that would

740
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:16,720
overlap into national security for example you could use this similar method to surveil a room

741
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:22,080
without cameras interesting uh you can use the potentials that exist all around us right now

742
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:27,920
in the quantum vacuum to surveil an entire room how would you do that um that i can't get into

743
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:33,440
unfortunately but the but it is possible it's very possible if you can use use it for communication

744
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:39,920
why not in other areas and i i know for a fact it's it's possible there were i know a group that

745
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,720
is working in the government that has been working on this since the 90s and they've had

746
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:49,680
massive success it's it's not like an ongoing-ish prototype it's been established they're just

747
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:54,640
working on multiple new versions of it do you think humans themselves like were like these

748
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:01,120
hard drive avatars or something of something higher because i think about you know dna uses

749
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:06,960
binary code so agct you basically just have you know base pairs you have two two combos

750
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,920
i'll tell you something i'll tell you something i think of dna if you want that that is highly

751
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,640
controversial but yeah tell me i think there's a third strand to our dna i think that the two

752
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,120
helixes that we're used to i think there's a third one down the middle that exist that is

753
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:26,720
physical but exists at the plank scale and i think it's electrically conductive how would that not

754
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:33,600
dawn on like all these biologists and geneticists you've interviewed someone who knows okay i think

755
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:40,320
i know you're talking about you've interviewed somebody who knows yeah yeah the initials gn

756
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:47,280
no comment okay interesting well that's a that would be pretty fascinating

757
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,440
and what would that mean implications wise well it would mean that what we call junk dna is not

758
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:59,760
junk first off there was junk dna is prosaically understood by geneticists and biologists the idea

759
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,600
that there's a third strand that would be controversial correct and it's possible that

760
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:12,080
third strand is again it may overlap with luke montagnier's dna water teleportation aspect

761
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:16,560
i don't claim to be an expert in that area with that said i do believe that there is something

762
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:23,200
there i would go one step further and say that there there's there is something there and

763
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:30,560
actually you know what i'll say it there's a gentleman that was a not not dr gary nolan

764
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,800
but there's another gentleman that i can tell you the name of after and show you the evidence

765
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:40,320
of in which i wrote up a manuscript dealing with the third strand of dna this is a two or three

766
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,840
years ago and they were willing to help me put it in a peer-reviewed format to help it be reviewed

767
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:51,840
in the more international literature unfortunately that individual was restrained from being able to

768
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:57,760
help me and so biologics and and the field of medicine and dna was not my area of focus and

769
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:04,160
so i kind of let that go with that said there was a gentleman peter gary yev he was nominated for

770
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:10,320
the nobel prize in 2019 or 2020 the nomination was retracted and he later died i believe under

771
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:15,920
mysterious circumstances he was using vector and scalar potentials through polarization methods to

772
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:23,440
heal people using sound and light wow he was he has it's i believe his wife still runs the website

773
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:30,160
and it's still up um i believe it's called uh linguistic wave genetics dot com i believe um

774
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:34,160
if you google it it's in russian but you can translate it there is an english version of the

775
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:39,360
website and you have all of his papers with all of his engineering methodologies um and he was

776
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:45,680
healing people inside of pyramids a wooden wooden pyramids that were and this is not me so you want

777
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:50,320
to something trippy you know brian merescu is by any chance i've heard the name he's um you

778
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:55,440
read a book called the immortality keys really good guys buddy of mine he texted me earlier today

779
01:11:56,240 --> 01:12:01,200
um because he's like man i've just been getting into the work of this guy constantine mile

780
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:06,160
and it explains a lot of my work around like you know scalar and vector potentials and its

781
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:10,800
effect on the human body right i've been interested in this for a while and it it's

782
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:15,840
it's interesting a lot of things seem to be convergent so so this guy was treating people

783
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,920
with pyramids uh pyramids he was having them go inside these pyramids that were

784
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:27,360
the the frame was wooden however he was using um vector and scalar potentials using uh

785
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:33,040
electronic circuits lasers semiconductors and so on to create a field in which when the person was

786
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:40,240
in that pyramid uh when they would they're again controversial but their um their ailments would be

787
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:45,200
healed whether it was depression or whether it was more of a physical ailment i don't want that

788
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:52,320
um this goes again back to the polarization of of a lattice of a material this goes back to the the

789
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:58,960
notion of voltage with potentials um the idea is that everything has memory so for example my hand

790
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,280
although it's aging right now the skin and everything it's possible that you can actually

791
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:08,000
actually let me give you a a very basic example so think of a stack of 10 books

792
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:14,560
now imagine we exist on book 10 we consider that as the present physical moment if you will yeah

793
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:20,800
and so it's possible that the previous let's say the previous books represent points in time that

794
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:26,640
were previous in which your hand was at a younger stage it's possible that you can use a polarizable

795
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:34,080
vacuum approach to bring say book three up to book 10 presently and replace book 10 with book three

796
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:40,240
meaning basically now your the skin is younger from a time temporal perspective and the entire

797
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:46,640
composition of the body is of that body you've body part you've treated is now literally younger

798
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:52,800
because of the negative and negantropic time reversal aspect that you've you've now implemented

799
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:59,760
using vacuum polarization using uh uh voltage and photons and light and and so on interesting

800
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:09,040
so biology does decay i guess via entropy it it it becomes more sort of yeah chaotically did you

801
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:16,000
know almost uh disassociates or something we we we disincarnate over over a period of time and

802
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,080
that's why we age or something there was a study sorry to interrupt you there was a study i believe

803
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:26,800
in the 70s which um basically showed that there was an observation in which a uap was hovering

804
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:32,560
near some plants and as an individual approached the uap the uap shot off as many people have

805
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:38,240
experienced however when the plants that were close to the uap were analyzed they had aged

806
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:44,720
10 years within x amount of hours it's called senescence so now yes no senescence but i mean

807
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:50,320
yeah i mean that would be the conventional term you go to chernobyl there's a study that came out

808
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:56,480
or not even a study an article that came out like this month i think about these dogs at chernobyl

809
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:02,240
that have rapidly evolved more than any other dog think about it right like it's it's easy like

810
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:09,440
uv radiation promotes you know genetic mutations or whatever right is differential selection and

811
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:15,120
that creates evolution right right and so if you were to grow a frog in a faraday chamber it would

812
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:19,280
grow you know kind of messed up and then if you're growing in a high radiation environment it would

813
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:25,600
grow you know grow too fast or whatever and so right yeah there's some sort of uh equilibrium

814
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:32,160
a la the shuman resonance of the earth this this magnetosphere of the earth that allows life to

815
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:37,200
form right and so i could see why a lot of this work would be pretty controversial because you're

816
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:42,240
kind of messing with the soup that we're all swimming in shuman resonance right it's been argued

817
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:47,840
that that is the the heartbeat of the planet so to speak yeah exactly right and that the reason

818
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:52,000
on the surface that the frequencies are so low is because you have to get closer into the center

819
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,440
of the earth for the frequency to get higher what if it's possible that the vector and scalar

820
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:03,040
communication potentials we were talking about again there are no electric or magnetic fields

821
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:07,840
purely toroidal geometries and when i said acoustic resonance what if that's the shuman

822
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:12,960
resonance that i'm that we're speaking of what if the shuman resonance can never disappear so to

823
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:20,560
speak from a from a field or from an area but e and b fields can but that resonance never does

824
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:28,000
because it is part of a more core makeup of this reality wow that's that it's i think you're i would

825
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
argue very strongly you're talking about the same thing there we're talking about acoustic resonance

826
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,720
or shuman resonance with regards to if you have a room like the room we're in now and we removed

827
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:42,560
all e and b fields yeah and there but there were still these resonant toroidal geometries um you

828
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:48,880
can overlap rf radio frequencies with acoustic uh frequencies and so these toroidal geometries

829
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:56,080
may in fact stem from uh the shuman resonance of the planet interesting so you would say that

830
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:01,520
the acoustic frequencies are sort of downstream of these rf frequencies that come from shuman

831
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,400
resonance or i'm saying that when you remove electric and magnetic fields and you deal purely

832
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:11,840
with potentials you you have still a resonance there interesting this goes back to what the

833
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:16,960
germans called the zitterbuegung meaning basically that from in quantum theory a particle is never

834
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,840
still so when we think of zero point energy the reason we call it zero point energy as i understand

835
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:27,280
is because when you get to absolute zero the particle is still oscillating classically we

836
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,680
think that like when you push a kid on a swing and then the kid jumps off the swing and the swing

837
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:37,600
comes to rest classically we're told we think that the swing is truly still but at the plank level

838
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:42,480
the particles that make up that swing are constantly oscillating still so all reality as

839
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:48,160
we see it is derived from some sub quantum field of arguably arguably that it's derived

840
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:53,520
yes that the potentials are more fundamental than the fields themselves and what determines how

841
01:17:53,520 --> 01:18:03,040
these potentials sort of collapse i i'm i don't want to say because it starts to overlap into

842
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:11,200
stuff that's pretty uh sensitive okay uh forgive me but um it's it does the mind have anything to

843
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,920
do i i believe i believe so i believe that i believe that at the core of it we're dealing

844
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:21,760
with non-physical sources here with what people have called spiritual um uh sorry i thought you

845
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,640
were going down another avenue that's why i said i couldn't speak on it but if you're going down

846
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:30,400
the spiritual or the the consciousness avenue i'm very i'm open to talk about that i think that

847
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:39,360
at the core of it we start getting to non-physical uh uh energies that otherwise give rise to uh

848
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:44,960
physical matter and material have you built anything with your newfound knowledge that

849
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:49,920
you can talk about uh the stuff i have built i i can't speak on okay that's the forgive me

850
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:58,960
i wish i could but that's all right okay um do you feel like after having gotten into some of these

851
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:05,920
esoteric science you know concepts that it's made you a more spiritual person oh absolutely

852
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:10,480
absolutely this is the part where most people i know that you're very open to this and as i've

853
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:15,920
said before we recorded i have great respect for you because you're so open to it um amongst other

854
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:22,800
things but yes i believe the spiritual aspect is the key fundamental core of all of this as much as

855
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,840
people will people are so interested in physical things i believe that the spiritual or slash

856
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:34,800
metaphysical angle is the core of all this without a shadow of a doubt i me personally i think that

857
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:41,680
the soul if you will is possibly a boze einstein condensate um uh matrix or a plasma matrix of

858
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:47,520
sorts what is it boze einstein it's a lay it's a level of or a field of a tier of matter if you

859
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,960
will above plasma so you have solids liquids gases plasma then you have boze einstein so

860
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:59,360
and then there are more than that to what extent those have been divulged publicly i i don't know

861
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,920
you have levels of energy above i didn't even know you have levels of energy above plasma that's

862
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,080
that's where that's what doctor in my opinion not to speak for him but that's what dr paez

863
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,840
spoke about when he was on kirchheim mungo's theory of everything when he said that it's

864
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:16,400
possible that you can induce these types of effects like inertial mass reduction and so on

865
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:22,160
not with solids but with plasmas because it's possible that plasmas act as a doorway between

866
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:28,240
uh the quantum vacuum and the physical world so to speak it's so if you think how does that work

867
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:32,880
uh in a very basic manner example the way i gave the example of like the pizza slices

868
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:38,480
for the maxwell the lorenz gate regaging and all that if you think of the quantum vacuum all around

869
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:43,600
us as moving very very rapidly maybe faster than the speed of light or maybe at the speed of light

870
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:49,280
um think of a bunch of doorways moving quickly side to side and they're moving so fast you

871
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:55,360
can't grab one of the handles to open the those doors plasma acts as a medium that slows down

872
01:20:55,360 --> 01:21:01,600
those doors so you can grab a handle and open it explain that plasma it's possible plasma slows down

873
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:09,040
uh uh quantum vacuum fluctuations and how does it slow down quantum vacuum fluctuations it's a it's

874
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:14,800
a it's an in-between state between a physical medium and a non-physical medium you see what

875
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:20,240
i'm saying so it acts as so it's like a carrier for the correct the potentials in some way the

876
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:26,000
same way that i would say uh that the work of sal paez's inventions not to speak for him but i

877
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,960
know that he agreed with me when i brought it up to him the devices themselves including the you

878
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:36,080
know rumored free energy devices and so on they're not generating the free energy they're acting

879
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:41,600
more as facilitators between the quantum vacuum and the material world they're not actually

880
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:48,320
generating in some cases they might be but in terms of even various forms of of energy generators

881
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:56,160
that are based in zero point uh zero point fields or zero point when we when we talk about virtual

882
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:03,040
particles right is free energy essentially uh the extraction of virtual particles into real

883
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:08,320
particles that in some cases yep uh you can argue if if one could get a coefficient of performance

884
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:11,920
over one that would be the case in some there's more than one way to skin this cat and that's

885
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:17,440
absolutely one avenue yeah and then one way is through like plasma is like this conduit it's

886
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:23,840
between the potentials world and like the world we see or something yep basically yeah have you

887
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:29,040
heard of uh ken shoulders absolutely exotic vacuum objects so how does that relate to this

888
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:35,520
i think what ken shoulders was doing was he was experimenting with curved space time uh uh

889
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:41,200
materials that induced the effects that happen when space time is not flat but curved so in other

890
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:46,000
words i believe ken shoulders had an experiment and please correct me if i'm wrong where basically

891
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,760
he found that electrical pulses into a ceramic would break not break ceramic but create these

892
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:56,560
punctures in the ceramic that electricity normally wouldn't do it's possible he was

893
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:02,240
interacting with a slight gravitational field in those with that with what he was doing now

894
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:07,760
another example is semiconductors and this is not well known but in the field of semiconductors

895
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:13,200
at least publicly to my knowledge when you when you're dealing with and forgive me if i butcher

896
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:17,520
this to those that are watching in the semiconductor field in the particularly on the manufacturing

897
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:23,600
but when you're dealing with the doping of the core lattice of a semiconductor yeah if you were

898
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:29,680
to take that core lattice and give it to audio experts to then analyze you would hear this non-stop

899
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:35,040
hum and that goes back to what we talked about with the zitterbuegung that the germans called

900
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:41,040
the the uh the swing stopping but there's still being every piece of matter is still oscillating

901
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:48,080
it's possible that hum is an electromagnetic interaction with the subtle gravitational field

902
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:51,920
whoa it's possible i'm not saying it is i'm saying it's possible because i don't know

903
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:56,480
it's interesting because that often is described around ufos as you hear this humming noise

904
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:06,000
that's really interesting yeah have you have you heard of burkhard heim i have i said this was this

905
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:12,080
german scientist who's working on some interesting kind of anti-gravitic you know stuff and then he

906
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,560
was brought over to the u.s and i think he worked with lockheed martin or martin corporation pre

907
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:22,000
lockheed merger martin marietta and martin marietta and i think they had a martin corporation at least

908
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,480
had a program called rias which was their anti-gravity research outfit got you and i

909
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:33,200
believe burkhard heim did contract work for them a lot of his work is in german but i believe he has

910
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:39,520
two errors on the theoretical physics side two guys named rusher and hauser okay they also believe

911
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:44,800
in two forms of gravity canonical like small scale gravity and large scale gravity and they

912
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:51,360
say one of these forms of gravity bind with electromagnetism more tightly specifically i

913
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,480
think some of these more exotic electromagnetic experiments involve i agree this sort of binding

914
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:00,560
i would agree i would agree i think that what they're saying there unless i'm interpreting

915
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:05,440
incorrectly is identical to what i was saying earlier in our conversation about how gravitational

916
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:11,680
effects could come from the electromagnetic conditions inducing topological states that

917
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:18,160
would lead to the coupling to the gravitational field that could then through the strong nuclear

918
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:24,560
force actually literally create you know have a you know more space time itself you know time

919
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:30,640
displacement would have you a situation where the inside of the craft is larger than the outside

920
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:35,680
you know space time metric engineering as dr putoff talks about i think there's something

921
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:42,560
there with superconductors and and semiconductors and high voltage that we already know secretly

922
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:48,000
can be done with that where do you think we are as far as ability to make progress on this because

923
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:53,840
my general sense is like if you had a governor placed on physics over the last 50 years

924
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:58,960
you know like the governor on an engine where you can only go to 25 miles per hour and the governor

925
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:06,160
in this case is like the speed of light as the speed limit right it's einstein's positivity

926
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:13,680
conditions on his field equations right it's uh you know no no scalar field you know you say

927
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:17,600
the governor is a bunch of different things right right right all those seem and that the governor

928
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:22,320
is your consciousness has nothing to do with your matter interactions you know whatever the

929
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:27,520
governor's coming off on all of those things at once is what it feels like right and so what does

930
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:32,400
that mean because i you have all these different you know dynamics at play you have the national

931
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:38,400
security state probably wanting to push this to the extent that it's not tipping the hat to the

932
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:44,080
adversary right you have all this civil side need for this just as far as our cities are in decay

933
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:50,320
like airplanes have not improved over the last 50 years at all you have this there's a duopoly

934
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:55,120
there's an energy crisis right now i believe in north america as well there's an i mean well we

935
01:26:55,120 --> 01:27:01,280
have we have fracking and stuff but like right yeah i mean like there should be some update there

936
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:06,640
as far and and maybe even an update beyond you know uh nuclear fission plants right and so you

937
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:10,080
know and there there are startups working on nuclear fusion but they're often working on it

938
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:16,400
from the super sisyphean perspective of these tokamak reactors where right the energy necessary

939
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:21,360
to create these high-powered lasers is just sort of self-defeating if you're trying to

940
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:26,240
create free energy in the first place it's like right why would you do this i think there have

941
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:32,160
been to your point i think there have been discoveries that make the white world of physics

942
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:38,240
i don't want to say laughable because i have tremendous respect for the people that generally

943
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:43,200
are not in the know and that just genuinely are trying to do good research but the implications

944
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:47,440
i think to your your main the core of your question i think we're at a time right now

945
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:51,360
where and i'm not speaking for anyone other than myself but from my little corner of the world i

946
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:56,800
think that we're dealing with multiple factions or elements of both government and private industry

947
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:02,480
that are that have vast influence on what could or could not be revealed and i think right now

948
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:08,640
there's an issue of no one really knows what to do yeah and i because if you if you reveal some

949
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:13,120
then what you know of a you know a technological advancement then people are going to take it and

950
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:18,640
run with it and then that's going to open up a whole other avenue of research that admittedly

951
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:24,880
can be weaponized pretty easily if someone has a nefarious mindset yeah so i do actually understand

952
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:31,920
to a significant extent the necessity for not divulging this in some cases now in other cases

953
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:38,720
i also think however that we should not let the the the carte blanche answer of national security

954
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:45,280
impede our spiritual and technological development yeah so i'm not saying i know what the answer is

955
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:49,680
i'm saying that it should be talked about more and all the people you've had on have been fantastic

956
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:54,800
to help move this this forward i think you've played a crucial role in this but as to how the

957
01:28:54,800 --> 01:29:00,640
line can be drawn i'm not going to sit here and pretend like it's easy it's it's effing tough

958
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:07,040
it's not easy yeah it's it's it's not easy because you open up one aspect of of zero point energy

959
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:11,600
engineering yeah next thing you know all of a sudden you know this guy's got uh this guy's

960
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:17,360
got cold fusion going and then that leads into maybe a coefficient of performance over one um

961
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:22,560
then that leads to all of a sudden you know with some adjustments all of a sudden you're now

962
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:28,000
basically doing what ken shoulders did you you pulse this um you know this this electromagnetic

963
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,040
energy into a piece of a ceramic or something and all of a sudden it breaks the ceramic when

964
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:38,560
you would expect it normally not to uh all this type of stuff and i think then you then have to

965
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:43,280
ask okay what and again this becomes an issue because it sounds like i'm trying to say that

966
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:48,080
there should be gatekeepers but i don't think there should be but at the same time you turn

967
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:51,920
some of these we have mutual friends that are privately working on some of these things where

968
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:58,000
with with you know half a year's worth of work six seven months worth of work in the lab all

969
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:05,120
of a sudden it's a weapon now and if someone gets a hold of that weapon it's game over for for a lot

970
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:09,440
of people the world's getting weird man i know it's interesting like it's like if you think about

971
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:16,560
um social control systems right hierarchies right maybe you had like religious hierarchies

972
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:23,520
of the past yes and then you have like compromise based like epstein ditty weird

973
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:30,400
shit like that yep and then you get like lower latency into like phones and laptops and digital

974
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:38,320
stuff and then you get into even weirder territory of like mind matter like you know the latency of

975
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:43,120
like these control systems and like maybe we're starting to see you know more anomalous stuff in

976
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:49,040
the sky like the veil is dropping correct it's weird i agree i think that the veil is dropping

977
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:54,720
and i think that people in general are starting to wake up more and without getting too esoteric

978
01:30:54,720 --> 01:31:01,440
i think that there is a profound reason for that that is the the sum of our collective

979
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:06,560
consciousnesses speaking to something larger than what we could possibly fathom currently

980
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:13,200
yeah it's a it's a really fascinating time have you ever seen a ufo uh oh yeah i've there uh my

981
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:17,040
old house there were there were a few that would be above it above the house there are few that

982
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:21,280
were above three three in total over the course of five years yeah i mean i've seen i've seen

983
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:25,520
a i've seen a bunch of them yes if you just first instinct what do you think they were

984
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:31,200
why were they around your house i i wish i could say i don't know i i i really don't know it was

985
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:35,840
very interesting um my father said to me hey come take a look one time one of the three times and

986
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:41,520
it was your typical it was like a donut shaped craft how for you like what's your what's your

987
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:46,560
dream with this stuff what do you what do you want to do that's that's that's a good question

988
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,880
i didn't actually i didn't expect you to ask me that uh because it's a it's a good question i

989
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:58,080
think um i think i want to help people as much as i can um with regards to understanding this stuff

990
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:03,680
which is why i privately consult for private groups in in certain areas and then there's

991
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:09,200
other projects that i work on that i i have to be honest i wrestle in a moral sense with

992
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:16,480
with even discussing divulging or not because um i've spoken with some very uh respectable high

993
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:21,040
level people in in the in the department of defense and some of those in which you know and

994
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:27,840
the advice has always been people it's it's people will not see what you see so it's it's in many

995
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:35,200
cases uh i think you would you as jesse would but i but the because i you're you jesse if i

996
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:39,600
could say quickly you're not the type of guy where if i showed you something you'd be like oh how can

997
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:46,400
i weaponize this but others would be and that's where i'm kind of like well i'll i'll i'll make

998
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:50,960
my living with the consulting right now and and working on private projects and so on for people

999
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:56,080
because as much as i want to you know open source it if you will there's an argument to be made that

1000
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:00,240
there have been people in the past that have open sourced it and then people just don't believe it

1001
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:08,640
yeah i know i i i think that's fair man i mean like there's a real argument to be made that like

1002
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:14,800
the next claus fuchs you know the guy that like stole the american atomic secrets worked at los

1003
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:22,320
almos from 1941 to 1950 went to the soviets with all that stuff is like somebody who just kind of

1004
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:27,840
runs their mouth on social media and like it brings up i don't know i mean like yeah they're

1005
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:36,320
like it's like we're both you know friendly with ashton forbes the mh370 stuff i'm not at all uh

1006
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:43,440
equating him to claus fuchs but i have these conversations with him uh about the mh370 videos

1007
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:49,520
you know these are this these orbs teleporting the you know the malaysian airplane in 2014 was

1008
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,680
this big news story cnn was talking about for three months this plane went missing nobody knew

1009
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:58,160
where the plane some weird circumstances around the plane and then you have this video come out

1010
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:03,120
that you know maybe it looks like they the these orbs just like teleported the plane right it's

1011
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:08,320
really bizarre right and now he's getting into all sorts of free energy and you know exotic physics

1012
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:13,600
stuff and i have these conversations with him and he's like so i think it's this can create a death

1013
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:18,480
weapon that will end the world but it needs to come out and i'm like dude i don't think either

1014
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:23,040
of us are smart enough to know and be high conviction that that's definitely the case

1015
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:29,440
like you hear things you have intuitions around that maybe it is the case right um but if you

1016
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:34,640
think that's the case and that is your intuition and you think this could be extremely dangerous

1017
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:39,440
in dual use it's really irresponsible to like just put a lot of this stuff out willy-nilly

1018
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:43,680
and it's the reason why with the towns and brown stuff that i put out i'm like

1019
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:50,080
uh that's like you know it's this 70 year snapshot from a long time ago but i'm like

1020
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:57,040
i'd love to know if somebody was like you know hey if this this is a there's one line from a

1021
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:01,680
biography of towns and brown you know it's paul shatskin book the man who mastered gravity where

1022
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:07,920
it's you know uh this will make a thermonuclear bomb look like a child's firecracker yes and

1023
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:13,520
yes you hear that i don't know if you take that at face value but if if i heard that

1024
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:18,560
that was the case i would never touch this stuff again and you've hit the nail on the head with

1025
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:23,760
regards to what i was trying to convey to you just now that's exactly the problem so but d are you

1026
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:29,040
high conviction that these things could be weaponized in like an extra world catastrophic way

1027
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:34,000
or i am of high i would put money on it really i would put money on it that's so then what i

1028
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,760
don't say that proudly so what do we do because on the one hand you have interstellar travel and

1029
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:44,560
like that'd be great if we get that right and you have like all these cool updates you get well i

1030
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:49,200
think i think i don't want to here's the thing i don't want to i wish i could i could sit here

1031
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:55,280
and say jesse i have a an alternative plan i i don't with that said i think that what we're

1032
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:59,440
seeing now with the discussion right now of meta materials and again i'm not trying to say that

1033
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:03,040
they're not i'm not trying to say they're worthless there's a lot of value especially

1034
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:07,760
you know layered semiconductors and blah blah blah but and and you know mixed with different

1035
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,200
alloys and all that but the the point i'm trying to make is that i think

1036
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:17,200
i think that's why the meta material angle was taken with regards to always saying we don't know

1037
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:21,760
how the physics of it works and there's meta we do know how it works i'll blatantly say we know

1038
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:26,960
exactly how it works we blame but if you if you just talk about the materials then it's like

1039
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:34,000
uh you're ignoring the the physics the physics more dangerous if someone can take the theoretical

1040
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:40,720
physics and apply it to experiments yeah yeah dangerous if you can bridge those two worlds

1041
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:45,120
not a lot of people some people can but some people can look at the theory and go oh my god

1042
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:49,200
i can make this and make that and make that other people only know how to engineer stuff and other

1043
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:53,280
people only know how to do theory which is still fantastic but if you can have someone that can do

1044
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:59,520
both yeah you have a problem or you have you you also it's a it's a half glass full half glass

1045
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:05,120
empty type scenario that's interesting because i was on the phone um with a new friend who is

1046
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:11,360
making a documentary about balbozar okay and i'm just speaking off the cuff and i'm like you know

1047
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,800
it would be an amazing interview i was like i really want to interview man i'll do anything to

1048
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:20,400
get in a room with this guy right right i'm like why don't i bring in this like a well-respected

1049
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:26,000
theoretical physicist right and he can translate some of the stuff that balbozar was saying as

1050
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,200
far as gravity a gravity b that sort of stuff right and the call kept cutting when i was saying

1051
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:37,680
that and i'm like oh interesting maybe and then i think about it for a second and i'm like if the

1052
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:42,640
theory i have about balbozar is right which is he was this limited hangout of a person sort of

1053
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:49,120
meant to reveal certain info but meant to hold back the rest yep then you wouldn't want to

1054
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:54,080
translate you know his stuff into like broader theoretical physics language you want to keep it

1055
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:59,120
lowbrow and somewhat stigmatized but still be this initiation path what i to your point what i

1056
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:03,360
will say is that there's information on the internet that has been out there for since the

1057
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:08,800
internet almost since and to the powers that be i won't do that i'll just i'll just talk to lazar

1058
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:16,160
there's information out there that has been being uploaded to the web since almost the uh the the

1059
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:22,800
the birth of the internet which up until this day which as as the information is scattered out there

1060
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:28,720
right now on the web is harmless but if it gets compiled in a particular order it becomes highly

1061
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:34,720
sensitive that's that's a legitimate thing and so the hard part is sifting the wheat from the chaff

1062
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:43,440
so to speak but if you can even to a to a even you know to a minimal extent it become that's when

1063
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:48,160
one's own this is where i think the push for the spiritual angle of things is necessary like when

1064
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:54,800
danny sheehan talked about we need to emphasize the spiritual component of this i couldn't agree

1065
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:59,840
more with mr sheehan when he says that i think that that's one of the reasons why the alleged

1066
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:05,200
stories of et visitations saying to our government leaders you have to develop spiritually before we

1067
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:10,880
can exchange more technological information with you or or material with you i think that's because

1068
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:18,640
that deals with the moral aspect and and spiritual responsibility of not uh blowing ourselves up and

1069
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:24,080
worse and worse it may be you know we talk about the messing with time temporal displacement um i'm

1070
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:29,680
familiar with that with a newspaper clipping uh from toronto canada from the 19 late 50s early

1071
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:35,120
60s that talked about how there was a gentleman that invented a death ray but for the people that

1072
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:40,000
came to go visit him there were some mosad uh representatives that went to go see him they

1073
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,520
reported missing time meaning their watch show whoa right and i'll show you the article tomorrow

1074
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:50,480
they reported that when they were in his living room or his basement i forgot which part of his

1075
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:55,600
house he was experimenting in 25 minutes had gone by for them but they when they came outside

1076
01:39:56,320 --> 01:40:00,400
the other the external clocks that showed that two hours went by and the mosad showed great

1077
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:07,440
interest and i believe he sold it to um to the uh this is literally in the article the the the

1078
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:14,000
zionist regime of of of israel in particular he stated uh wait what yeah yeah i'll show you the

1079
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,960
article tomorrow he sold some like sold that it was i don't want to say what it's like a timeline

1080
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:23,680
manipulator no initially it was like a death ray of some sorts uh that he was working on

1081
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:29,600
uh it's a it's a two-page article very old um someone like photocopied it and or scanned it

1082
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:35,680
and put it on the web uh but it was essentially a death ray of sorts and some of the side effects

1083
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:41,760
of when he turned it on was temporal displacement in within the vicinity of that's interesting i

1084
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:49,600
mean i don't know if that's seems so wild to me but there's there's this um uh you know tesla

1085
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:55,200
biographer i was speaking to recently right and he was talking about how tesla um you know would

1086
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:59,440
do some of these high voltage experiments and he would say weird things like i see the future the

1087
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:04,560
president of the past all at once right and towns and brown was extremely interested in time

1088
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:10,080
alteration time travel yep do you think and then the final thing is you know there's a guy named

1089
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:14,640
timothy taylor's a nasa mission controller right who's written about in diana pesulka's book

1090
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:19,600
called american cosmic he is a successful nasa mission controller that works on like you know

1091
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:28,160
spacex missions and stuff at cape canaveral right and he told i guess chris bloodsoe who's

1092
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:32,080
had experienced all these sort of ufo sightings at his house for whatever reason tim taylor shows

1093
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:38,480
up at his house and they become friends right and he tells uh chris i was part of this secret

1094
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:44,000
time travel group uh based in nasa and the bahamas and thomas towns and brown was the president of

1095
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:49,040
this group and i would think that would be total quackery if i wasn't so deep on towns and brown

1096
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:53,600
right right and i didn't know he was so deep into time travel stuff and he spent a lot of time in

1097
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:59,120
nasa and the bahamas and so i i do find that interesting i i agree i i think um if i could

1098
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:03,120
say quickly from a scientific perspective it's been argued that what's called charge

1099
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:08,880
parity inversion in the vacuum or in the quantum vacuum is equivalent to reflection and what that

1100
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,800
means essentially is we're dealing with vacuum polarization and if we're dealing with vacuum

1101
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:19,600
polarization if we polarize time but not space we can have this scenario in which time displacement

1102
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:25,200
does occur wait how do you polarize because i think of time and space is indelibly bound

1103
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:32,000
so how do you these longitudinal scalar waves that we've been speaking of are help tap time

1104
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,040
rather than space how do you do that oh well you're asking how to engineer that one example

1105
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:41,840
well one example would be for example uh would be sal piaz's work or how's space how put off

1106
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:48,800
spacetime metric engineering but you're controlling for space or you are manipulating time to then

1107
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:57,600
which which as a residual effect has effects on space interesting okay and so so time is the kind

1108
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:03,840
of archimedean upstream thing that is updating space right so if you think of these longitudinal

1109
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:09,200
waves right as slinkies all around us right and each slinky has a loop that loop represents a

1110
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:15,040
state of entropy and neg entropy so what i mean by that is i have my water bottle here right for

1111
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:20,800
example i take this water say i take this water and i put it on the table between this point in

1112
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:26,800
space between here when i when i brought the water to the table and then here one loop of that

1113
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:32,640
longitudinal uh wave has been completed and now we're moving on to the next loop like a movie reel

1114
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:37,760
there the loops are constantly moving which is what we which is a temporal effect

1115
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:44,320
and so essentially you can have a device where you can observe by polarizing if you came back

1116
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:50,320
say whenever you know six months from now and you had a device that could look wherever you pointed

1117
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:55,600
that device that particular part of space you could see in the past and you had a device that

1118
01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:00,800
could see that you could have a device that could show using the vector and scalar potentials of

1119
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:09,040
space and time itself my um a visual of my hand doing this over and over why it's because that's

1120
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:16,560
what i i so i i did um i did a i was on a panel one time with sal paez um and a handful of others

1121
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:23,520
uh last two summers ago and basically i used this exact example and sal paez started basically

1122
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:29,040
clapping as if to say yes that's what you have to yeah it's if there were to be a conflict on

1123
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:34,480
some more primordial level than our earthly conflicts it would be on the level of time

1124
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:38,160
correct and that leads to things like the you know the rumors of the philadelphia experiment

1125
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:42,000
yeah well that was thomas towns of brown was involved in the philadelphia experiment

1126
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,880
that's temporal displacement the rumors that the people were some people were stuck between a wall

1127
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:52,080
or like yeah physical physical matter and that arguably is worse than a nuclear bomb i just am

1128
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:56,400
not sure what happened in the philadelphia experiment like a part of me thinks it was this

1129
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:01,920
quacky disinfo campaign maybe there i think there was actually something underlying it

1130
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:08,320
even if it was fake the rumors that that that discuss that that speak of it are similar to

1131
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:12,720
the way temporal displacement would work as i understand it have you heard of bob beckwith

1132
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:20,160
by any chance oh robert beckwith yes yes i have yes does he say because he claims that i think

1133
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:25,280
he was maybe somewhat involved in the philadelphia experiment and i think he later did some really

1134
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:31,840
interesting work with like extremely high magnetic fields yep and uh and then and

1135
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:38,080
teleportation until yep so i think there's something there again i think magnetism is

1136
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:42,880
is gravity's cousin and i think that again you manipulate space time you're messing with gravity

1137
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:47,360
but you're also messing with again time itself and so if i could say very quickly when i gave

1138
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:52,720
the example of my putting the water like picking the water up and putting it on the table imagine

1139
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:59,200
there's a parcel of of of memory that it will forever exist now even when i stop doing this

1140
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:03,680
that is that is acting like a movie reel that is just sitting there in the vacuum

1141
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:11,040
waiting to be reloaded up again if you will whoa or re-rendered if you think like a saved game

1142
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:16,480
state correct there you go exactly like a saved game state so we think of the we see some you

1143
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:21,280
know david bohm talked about you know this uh holographic morphogenic reality we live in there

1144
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:26,880
have been some papers recently that have discussed that as well um and it's again i think there's

1145
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:33,920
something there i really do it's very interesting yeah this idea of rendering holographic theory

1146
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:39,600
and so on i think it speaks to what james rider was saying with regards to what what is light

1147
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:45,760
i think there's something with that as well um i believe the uh the bavita gita if i'm not mistaken

1148
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:52,000
right the that oppenheimer quoted i i could be wrong about this but i recall reading that the

1149
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:58,320
original translation was not i am death the destroyer of worlds it was i am time the destroyer

1150
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:04,800
of worlds really as i understand it is that true i we can verify that but i believe it's funny

1151
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:10,080
you know i can get a little crazy with these things but like sometimes i think of like the end

1152
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:18,560
of time right as like a um in the beginning of time right as like these double entendres where

1153
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:22,560
it's like the end of time is like what does that even mean right like it's it's you're kind of

1154
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:27,520
referring to the apocalypse right right but maybe it's the end of time itself and if you think we're

1155
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:34,000
living in a lower 3d time bound universe or whatever maybe there's some apotheosis like event

1156
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:40,640
there's some eschatological escalatory event yeah that will lead to the next step or fit yeah

1157
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:46,240
the end of xeno's arrow of time perhaps where we're become more trans temporal in nature

1158
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:52,400
very possible where we're not moving in this kind of river arrow of time that like you know well

1159
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:56,480
that's why for example it's it's you know for example if we could get on that topic very

1160
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:01,920
quickly it's like for if you go out to a um uh you go out with friends to a bar and then all

1161
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:06,400
of a sudden you get a bad feeling that something's going to happen and then you say guys let's go

1162
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:11,680
and then you know an hour or two later there's a shooting or a stabbing it's possible that you were

1163
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:18,480
viewing a point in time that has already happened in in your soul if you will but hasn't played out

1164
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:24,080
in the material world i believe that i think you can i think you can actually not prove that

1165
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:29,520
scientifically but like we're getting there yeah the brain probably works like a room temperature

1166
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:33,600
quantum system maybe i think you know as well like penrose would say this right with the

1167
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:38,400
microtubules yes if that's the case you have temporal non-locality in quantum systems

1168
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:43,840
exactly and we know we can reverse qubit positions in quantum computations right and so if you it's

1169
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:49,040
been hypothesized by anybody working on quantum computer right very credible people will say yeah

1170
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:54,080
maybe in a working quantum computer you could send information back in time even on the semantic

1171
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:59,840
application layer right so you could send it you know information about like uh you know some

1172
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:04,640
password you could send it back in time like you know a month prior or whatever as long for as long

1173
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:09,520
as the quantum computer has been on right and so if you think about the brain as possibly this room

1174
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:15,200
temperature quantum system maybe we do have access to shards of the future especially when it's

1175
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:19,840
adaptive for our survival right so when you have like a really you know bad or scary premonition

1176
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:24,800
really meaningful event right you might actually have access to that and there might be a physical

1177
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:29,200
way of explaining that i think i think the only work that i know of and again because it's not

1178
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:35,120
really my area of competency but the only work that i know of is dean raden yeah and i think

1179
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:39,520
that what he's onto is very interesting to your point it can't be proven at least yet that we

1180
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:45,280
know of but it's possible that it might be able to um to to be at some point in the in the near

1181
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:50,960
distant future do you think that blue being that prompted you to get into all this crazy stuff

1182
01:49:51,680 --> 01:50:00,720
is still helping you out um yeah yes um what do you think that blue being is it's i'll be

1183
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:07,280
honest with you i don't know i've i've really i don't know have you seen it since um it's more

1184
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:13,120
of a feeling rather than a visual that experience was a very unique one and i haven't had it since

1185
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:18,720
it's more of a feeling why do you think it chose you i think it i'll be honest with you i think

1186
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:22,960
there are hundreds of thousands of people across the world that that people have encountered with

1187
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:28,640
those exact similar experiences well it's interesting you have like ramanujan you know downloading

1188
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:33,600
math so you look at the history of the the phenomenology of science itself and it's way

1189
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:37,680
trippier i don't right so to your point i don't think i'm the only one by any stretch i think

1190
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:43,920
that um if if you think about the possibility that there's an attempt to educate the younger

1191
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:48,880
generation you know people younger than me there again i'm not on tiktok but the few things i've

1192
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:54,640
seen on tiktok with regards to kids understanding uh just you know is science and all that baffles

1193
01:50:54,640 --> 01:51:00,400
me in in a positive way yeah because it's like where are they learning this from and in some

1194
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:06,000
cases i've i've met with some families where the kids i've been graciously allowed to speak with

1195
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:13,040
the kids and the kids have said well the the the the the ghost comes and tells me they don't know

1196
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:18,560
how else to explain it and it's like wait a minute you've just described you know geodesic

1197
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:23,920
time-like curves and with you know with regards to time machines or and so on and it's like how did

1198
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:28,800
you you're like eight years old how did you you know what i mean yeah well it goes it goes into

1199
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:34,160
like how do we know anything and what and and epistemics and and you know i actually just

1200
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:39,120
interviewed this harvard neuroscientist who's studying these telepathic kids got you the whole

1201
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:43,200
world's about to know about this oh wow because you have these controlled experiments where you

1202
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:47,680
have the kid in one room and then you have the parent one parent specifically that they have

1203
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:52,320
some sort of mind meld with right and you know random images popping up in the room with the

1204
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:58,320
parent and they can 95 percent of the time accurately say that a baseball or a grapefruit

1205
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:03,280
or a cloud is popping up on the screen it's absurd it's absurd and and and she got into this

1206
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:07,040
because she was really interested in like people like kim peak who's the inspiration for rainman

1207
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:13,440
and like savant right that would like it felt like they were accessing knowledge libraries

1208
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:18,560
in the cloud they weren't just like in a toiling away learning things for years at a time or

1209
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:25,120
whatever exactly so i think i think we're on the verge of a greater epistemological paradigm shift

1210
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:30,240
and i'm excited to be here for it um and i think you're a part of it i appreciate it and i think

1211
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:34,560
you're playing a very crucial role in all of this and i think to your point if i could say without

1212
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:40,960
bringing this up again i think that that third strand of dna that we talked about

1213
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:47,120
may also because it's electrically conductive may be an organic particle accelerator that our bodies

1214
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:52,000
allow us to access with regards to the pineal gland that may in fact allow for information

1215
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:58,640
download um from what people have called organic particle accelerator how would that work uh well

1216
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:04,000
the idea would be maybe perhaps we are organic versions of what physical uap are of what physical

1217
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:11,840
of what craft are um we may be the carbon-based organic version of of what if you look at the

1218
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:17,600
way in which a craft allegedly operates or the way in how it it operates in an engineering sense

1219
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:24,000
it's not unlike that of a human body except in a few different except with a few different uh with

1220
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,440
a few differences well they're ancient traditions that would describe these things as sort of soul

1221
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:34,640
carriers or something right right so i think that i think that's pretty spot on my opinion well then

1222
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:38,240
i think about that and then i think about some of these defense use cases and i'm like that's a

1223
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:44,320
little gnarly yeah yes yes i think there's a whole psychotronic aspect to this that's very

1224
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:50,320
controversial but i think um for example there was a foyer leak out of the washington dc fusion

1225
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:55,360
center that someone had filed a foyer with regards to looking into some uh political groups

1226
01:53:55,360 --> 01:54:00,640
but it turned out that they were given i think the file was called uh effects on the human body

1227
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:06,800
and basically what it showed was that through the psychotronic uh electromagnetic uh i don't want

1228
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:12,160
to unfortunately weapons it showed the human biofield and the different frequencies that

1229
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:18,240
could be applied to it from a distance in which you could um manipulate the body i know for example

1230
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:23,840
someone that worked on a on a device that uh can make someone immediately have to defecate

1231
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:29,760
uncontrollably um wait you know somebody that works on a device that makes people remotely

1232
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:37,680
take a shit yes are you serious yes who's this person they're they're not public but they're

1233
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:41,840
but no it's it's been i mean this is and i'll tell you to the people that know of this stuff

1234
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:46,880
that's old news and that's why i'm so confident in what i'm saying with regards to this oh man

1235
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:52,240
that's freaky yeah and i'm not trying to scare people i believe that those same methodologies

1236
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:56,800
could also be used to heal people so again we have an overlap how do we heal people well this

1237
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:01,680
goes back to our conversation of the uh polarizing the vacuum the linguistic wave genetics the the

1238
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:06,240
russian gentleman for example yeah yeah it goes back to that what we're dealing with is an overlap

1239
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:12,080
of all these fields of and so basically the same things that can hurt people can also help people

1240
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:19,520
well man i hope to god because i think these things are speeding up that uh we evolve in our

1241
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:26,800
consciousness and and uh yep are made capable to handle what i think is ultimately a forcing

1242
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:31,040
function for humanity which is technological progress along these lines i couldn't agree more

1243
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:36,880
i couldn't agree more um yeah so that's it's pretty pretty interesting it's fascinating would

1244
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:42,960
you ever do um another one of these with a theoretical physicist that i could bring in

1245
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:47,360
from like a traditional academic background because i think that would be kind of yeah

1246
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:51,760
sure i i'll tell if i could end end by saying this jesse i want uh what i want you and your

1247
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:55,840
audience to know is i'm not expecting anyone to blindly believe me there are things that i've

1248
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:01,120
seen in private laboratories that are undeniable and verified by people other than myself in those

1249
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:06,960
facilities however i i'm of the view that i know what i know but i don't expect people to blindly

1250
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:11,680
believe me unless unless they've seen it for themselves so for me i don't get um i don't

1251
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:16,800
get discouraged if a theoretical physicist said calls me crazy or says you know i'm open to some

1252
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:22,320
of your stuff but the rest is too crazy to woo for me i'll talk to anybody i love it man well

1253
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:28,080
i appreciate what you're doing and um thank you you have such an amazing cool story i appreciate
