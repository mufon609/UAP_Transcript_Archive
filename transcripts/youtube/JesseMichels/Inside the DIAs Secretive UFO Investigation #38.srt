1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Okay, but the real men in black, are we talking about humans or non-human intelligence?

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,400
What is the real men in black compared to just government agents being, you know, interrogating

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,880
people?

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,840
I think there's enough evidence in the literature to indicate that the phenomenon may be associated

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,440
with some cases of what we call men in black.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,400
But what are they?

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,480
Secrets, cover-ups, and strange phenomena.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,320
UFOs and ideas that challenge reality itself.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,520
All these mysteries, all this time, are we ever going to get to the bottom of these?

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,760
My name is George Knapp.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,320
I dig into news stories that others can't or won't.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,160
I'm Jeremy Korbel, and for some reason, people tell me things they probably shouldn't.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,560
And this is Weaponize.

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,320
Alright you guys, welcome to Weaponize.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,840
We had some technological problems, I'm going to blame that on George Knapp, but we have

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,640
a great episode with Dr. James Lakatsky, Dr. Colm Kelleher, talking about the UFO programs

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,720
and their new book, which is Inside the U.S. Government Cover UFO Program, Initial Revelations.

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,480
So jumping on in with all you all, here we go.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,560
James Lakatsky, it's so great to have you and Colm here to talk about OSAP.

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,240
For the benefit of our audience that does not understand the difference between OSAP

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,400
and ATIP, your new book, Inside the U.S. Government Covert UFO Program, Initial Revelations, really

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,560
draws a distinction.

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,760
And it's not bashing ATIP, it's not going after Lou Elizondo or showing differences,

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,320
but there were distinct differences between those two programs.

25
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,280
Can you outline for our audience, those who are not aware of what each of those acronyms

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,480
mean, what the difference was?

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:02:02,360
Well, the Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Applications Program was basically created

28
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,800
between myself and Senator Reid at the Defense Intelligence Agency.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,240
It was a $22 million program.

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,600
It had the capability of going five years.

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,660
We completed our objectives in two years.

32
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:31,140
You might say it was test of various components of a UFO, UAP, paranormal research program.

33
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:38,020
Right from the beginning, it included all aspects of both UFOs and the paranormal in

34
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,660
relationship to UFOs.

35
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:48,420
It was a contract that was put out on the Internet, it had a quick turnaround because

36
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,240
of the funding mechanism.

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,280
The first year was $10 million, the second year was $12 million.

38
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:07,600
And we gutted out, we had numerous interested parties who wished to bid on the contract,

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,560
but following the regulations, it first had to go to small businesses.

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,480
Well, the only small business, we found small businesses that were capable of bidding on

41
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,200
it, but they chose not to.

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:29,360
Bob Bigelow's Bass created specifically, and that was so important to DIA, specifically

43
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,760
to address our needs in this program.

44
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,740
And when I say needs, we used a new method of putting out this request for proposal.

45
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,900
We did not tell the contractor, the bidder, what to do.

46
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,700
We said, this is what we wanted achieved, how would you do it?

47
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:59,500
And that's how this program was created and had specifically all the right components.

48
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,260
Let me back up a little bit just for our listeners, people that are listening, and also just for

49
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,020
the visual audience here.

50
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:13,140
Dr. Lekatsky, first of all, in December 2017, the world learned that there was a UFO study

51
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,560
program and that it was funded for $22 million.

52
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,940
They heard that that program was called AATIP, but what you've told us is that no, you ran

53
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:29,060
the program, the DIA for studying UFOs, and it was called AWSEP, Advanced Aerospace Weapon

54
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,700
System Applications Program.

55
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:38,340
So you're talking now about a government study, a UFO program, studying all the physics

56
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,460
and the nature of UFOs up to date.

57
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,140
And so you're kind of coming forward with these books, with Dr. Kelleher and George

58
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,500
Knapp, and you're laying it out for people, this is what we did, this is how we did it,

59
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,140
we don't want it to get messed up, we want to tell you what happened.

60
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:03,340
It's a big deal that you're speaking to us right now as someone from the DIA who studied

61
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,900
UFOs.

62
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:11,700
So I guess the question for me, very simple, the audience might want to know, is that when

63
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:18,980
that came out, December 2017, and you didn't see your program named there, what does that

64
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,980
feel like?

65
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,980
Are you doing this because you want to clarify the record to the public?

66
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,980
Exactly.

67
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,900
And we stated that clearly in Skinwalkers at the Pentagon.

68
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,780
We want to clarify the record.

69
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,500
Now we're giving the details of the record.

70
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:43,700
Now, the thing is, ATIP, the name itself, I did not create that name, but it was created

71
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,740
for a specific reason, and I don't think that's ever been printed.

72
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,700
It was done, yes, in Senator Reed's letter asking for a special access program.

73
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,020
That's been out in the press for, what, five years now.

74
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,540
But where did the need for a different name come from?

75
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:10,020
It came from, which took me by surprise when I saw the funding, someone, in other words,

76
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,180
the notification of funding that, yes, DIA was getting this money.

77
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:21,580
It was on a piece of paper that had highly classified programs listed on the rest of

78
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:31,660
the paper, and someone in Congress put secret on the program name and its very abbreviated

79
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,700
contents that were on that document.

80
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,900
I did not want to get us crossways with any security considerations.

81
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,700
I wanted a different name.

82
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:50,540
Now, I believe that who we called Axelrod or perhaps Luella's on or perhaps some of

83
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:57,700
their cohorts, and maybe all of them came up with the name ATIP, that name would have

84
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:05,580
been a great problem for DIA because ASAP routed the money to the Defense Warning Office

85
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,660
of DIA, period.

86
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,140
It had to be that name.

87
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:17,860
So the contract may have been called that, too, because that's what we put at the open

88
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,300
solicitation that can still be found on the Internet.

89
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:31,940
And I've repeated in Skinwalkers at the Pentagon a concise amount of material as to what we

90
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,420
requested. But that's where the name ATIP came from.

91
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,860
ATIP was something that was necessary to be

92
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,300
proceeded with on military cases.

93
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,060
Lue handled that.

94
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,620
I was not privy because it was mainly spun up as I was getting ready to retire.

95
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:03,500
I will say this, though, that when I left, all of our references were electronically,

96
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,460
specifically scanned in electronically at DIA.

97
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,740
Now, I can't say what happened in the years since I retired in 2016.

98
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,940
It could have been that they're purged, but they weren't physical records.

99
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:26,220
So I don't see why there is a problem in people asking for them, except for the fact.

100
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,980
And this is why these books are required.

101
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,940
Most of them were proprietary.

102
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:38,980
Remember, they were monthly reports from the contractor and specialized studies.

103
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:51,220
They had people's names, contractor names, the facilities that were being bought and

104
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,900
constructed. They had security information.

105
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,260
They had all of this.

106
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:05,580
And I have already told I wasn't asked to have these documents cleaned for release.

107
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:13,180
But the proprietary information is so much I said preemptively I wouldn't take on that

108
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,180
job. It's just too much.

109
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,460
We're doing it in this manner.

110
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:26,180
The public knows what went on in that program within the constraints of security.

111
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,740
I hope that answers your question, because ATIP was a specialized small program.

112
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,900
It had access, I'm sure, to funds that I also had access to, but not use on this program of

113
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:46,380
where we can go out and, let's say, review facilities at DIA.

114
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:53,940
I used them to review missile contractors, in other words, so I could learn the nuts and bolts.

115
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:00,740
But money, I'm sure, was available for ATIP, but nowhere near $22 million in two years.

116
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,340
That's really helpful. So, George, we're talking about that, like how ATIP kept its legs,

117
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,700
because it was heroic in an attempt to kind of continue it.

118
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,980
The fact there was money available wasn't out of the $22 million.

119
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,460
And we're making that clear. It was misreported in The New York Times.

120
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,300
However, it is nice to know somehow how they got any funding to do the work they were doing.

121
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:30,780
Yes. And I was aware of some of the programs, the cases that they were looking into.

122
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:39,100
And I can say without going into detail, because it's a classified endeavor, I was

123
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,140
fascinated by one of their cases, because it was a repeat from the 60s.

124
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,620
And if you go through our databases, you're going to see cases where people claim,

125
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,340
wait a minute, I saw the same UFO when I was 20 years younger.

126
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,300
And those cases kind of fascinate me.

127
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,900
How can that be? At least, are we talking about time machines?

128
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,860
Well, what are we talking about?

129
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:13,260
But you will find that another fascinating point of our huge databases,

130
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,660
it would be the equivalent of us going out for a drive in our car.

131
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,860
And every car and truck we meet on the road is of a different design.

132
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:29,380
I mean, to me, that's that's an interesting insight, because when people make up charts

133
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,580
and we have a nice one of all the configurations of UFOs

134
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:41,740
and those are main configurations like triangle, there are very many variants of triangles.

135
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,620
It's like, how can this be?

136
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,940
I mean, it's like, certainly we're doing things exactly the opposite in the auto industry.

137
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,900
Every SUV looks like every other SUV.

138
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:01,180
You have to look at the name badge in order to tell what brand is that.

139
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,940
I like it or I dislike it.

140
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:12,460
But right now, I like them all, mainly because they all look like in the UFOs, totally the opposite.

141
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:19,780
There's one particular UFO design that gets discussed in the book that you reveal.

142
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,740
And if you if you blink, you'll miss it.

143
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:30,100
But it's it's maybe the most controversial and important piece of information that this book conveys.

144
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,940
You say something at the beginning of Chapter nine about a craft of unknown

145
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,140
origin that our government access, finally access the inside.

146
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,380
Can you share with us what's in the book?

147
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,260
And is there anything else you can add to that?

148
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:53,820
Well, what's in the book is an exact statement of of the event that occurred in the.

149
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,020
And let's say in a congressional facility.

150
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:08,740
There was more to it, considerably more to that discussion about what this situation was.

151
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:18,820
We can't go into that because it's it's and what I mean, column and I, yes, we know about it.

152
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,500
People are interested in it, I'm quite sure.

153
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,700
But security has to trump everything else.

154
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,500
A lot of things can be said.

155
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,180
This was this book, as was Skinwalkers at the Pentagon.

156
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:39,220
I keep flashing book, basically was reviewed by the Department of Defense for

157
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,540
released and approved the wording that's in it, the wording.

158
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,780
If we varied that wording, we'd get back.

159
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,180
This was a seven month review.

160
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,340
This was quick.

161
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:57,940
D.O.D. on Skinwalkers at the Pentagon took 14 months to review that book.

162
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:05,060
And there was I agreed with all of the changes on both of these books.

163
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:12,260
I agreed with except for one, I made the fatal mistake of complementing the help from a

164
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,100
non D.O.D. organization.

165
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,540
And it was, whoa, we can't do that.

166
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,780
We've got to align that out.

167
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,420
And so that's that was the only thing that was a straight line out.

168
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,340
D.O.D. helped us reward things by their security regulations.

169
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,220
And so you're getting as much as we can say, Jeremy.

170
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,060
OK, hold on, hold on, hold on.

171
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,460
So for our audience, this list is George has dropped an atom bomb because it was

172
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,580
dropped in the book. So audience is just listening.

173
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,940
I want to read you something.

174
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,260
Beginning of Chapter nine, at the conclusion of a 2011 meeting in the Capitol building

175
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,620
with a U.S. Senator and an agency undersecretary, Lekatsky, the only one of the

176
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,980
book's authors present, posed a question.

177
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,740
But this is where it gets good.

178
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,540
He stated, meaning you, Dr.

179
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:08,380
Lekatsky, that the United States was in possession of a craft of unknown origin and

180
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,900
had successfully gained access to its interior.

181
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:18,980
This craft had a streamlined configuration suitable for aerodynamic flight, but no

182
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,980
intakes, exhaust, wings or control surfaces.

183
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,020
In fact, it appeared not to have an engine, fuel tanks or fuel.

184
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,660
Now, there's a next part which I'll read in a minute.

185
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,260
But what this is, is you're officially allowed to tell us that the United States

186
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,380
government has in its possession a craft of unknown origin and you were able to

187
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,860
access the inside.

188
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,180
Is that correct?

189
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,940
The wording that you read is correct.

190
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,700
Ah, you're going beyond the wording.

191
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,020
No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm asking you, did that happen?

192
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
And is it true? And it's true.

193
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:03,500
OK, you're telling us, you told us because you were allowed to tell us that our

194
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,820
government has a UFO in its possession and has been able to access the inside of it.

195
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,940
Right? Yes.

196
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,300
Well, I was allowed to tell you, let me show the back of the book.

197
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,500
This is what I know.

198
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,580
I know. Hold up.

199
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,220
George, will you translate, George?

200
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,700
All right. Let's try another tack.

201
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,860
How do we know it's a craft and not a doorstop?

202
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
We accessed it. It has no engine.

203
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,740
It has no wings, no, no, no fuel.

204
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,980
It doesn't. We don't know that it travels.

205
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,580
Do we know it's a craft or it's just a rock?

206
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,340
George, you're you're going into the further discussion that occurred that day.

207
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,540
All right. We can't we can't go there.

208
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,580
But let me tell you, we're going to try to cover that in the future.

209
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,980
But it's it's delicate.

210
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,700
It's it's. It makes it.

211
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,900
It makes the technology described in here look primitive.

212
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,660
Why is it delicate?

213
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,060
Why is this topic?

214
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,580
The United States government has a UFO in its possession,

215
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,900
and we've been reverse engineering it.

216
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,300
You've done it. Why is it delicate?

217
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,580
The details you I'm old school.

218
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,940
I'll use the term.

219
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:22,860
I won't use the term adversary competitor as the way we describe.

220
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:30,220
We are surrounded, maybe not surrounded, but hopefully not so.

221
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:37,300
By our enemies and our enemies, you can be sure they're listening to this show right now.

222
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,940
You can be sure that they were monitoring awesome.

223
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,900
You can be sure that perhaps they had employees.

224
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:57,940
Hopefully, not in the contract or part that was we're giving out information for I am.

225
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:06,700
I am. I know that, so the thing is, is we can't say anything more than what we've been approved to say.

226
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:13,740
And there's insight to this, but I want to I want to I want to shift it just slightly.

227
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,460
But it shows my point, Skinwalkers at the Pentagon and Initial Revelations,

228
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,340
if I might use the shorter title on this new book.

229
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,940
But has some interesting doors that have not been even mentioned.

230
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,420
One, why was this program started?

231
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,300
Two, why was this program ended?

232
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,300
And we've raised this partially and Skinwalkers at the Pentagon.

233
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
Did it end?

234
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:49,500
Also, we had an interesting program that ended in the middle of the year.

235
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:58,540
Also, we had a chapter in Skinwalkers at the Pentagon where we met with a high level Brazilian official at a meeting,

236
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,340
started introducing some of our cohorts.

237
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,780
And no one ever asked us, why did you have that meeting?

238
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,460
What was so important about that meeting?

239
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,860
You know, there's a lot of material in there that as Kit Green, Dr.

240
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:24,180
Kit Green, one of our consultants on the OSAT program said, read between the lines.

241
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:29,300
That applies both to Skinwalkers at the Pentagon and Initial Revelations.

242
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,260
Read between the lines.

243
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,700
Now, you may come to the wrong conclusions.

244
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:40,900
And I can tell you on the topics I just read, read, you don't have enough information to come to the correct answers.

245
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,380
OK, so why? Sorry, go ahead, go ahead, Jeremy, go ahead.

246
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,100
So why? You're asking one big question people should ask is why was the UFO program started?

247
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,940
Maybe you can't tell the full story, but give us a hint.

248
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,740
Why was the UFO program started?

249
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,740
You said that's important.

250
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:04,060
I can't do that without documenting more and getting approval.

251
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,780
I mean, can I just do that?

252
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:14,620
I know, Jeremy, you and I have met previously several times and you want the bottom line.

253
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,060
But the bottom line may not.

254
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:23,060
Let me just give you the bottom line may not be what you anticipate.

255
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,700
In other words, there may be no bottom line.

256
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,580
There may be multiple bottom lines.

257
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,780
And we've got a lot of work.

258
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:39,020
You know, if Arrow is going to move forward from this point, they've got a lot more work to do.

259
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:47,460
Why? One of the questions that you posed to us just now was why was the program started?

260
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,860
OK, you can't answer that.

261
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:56,820
But another question you're saying people should ask is why did you do all the defense intelligence reference documents?

262
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,020
So can you answer that?

263
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,660
Why did you do all those defense intelligence reference documents?

264
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:10,820
And the answer is no, I can't answer that, because that would that would be an answer that would just floor people.

265
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,060
Really?

266
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,060
Yes, the real answer.

267
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:26,220
And by the way, I don't know whether there's ever been real criticism, but there kind of has by the nature of some of these topics.

268
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:40,780
We solicited the input for the topics for the 38 papers from from Air Force Intelligence, CIA, Naval Intelligence and Ground Intelligence.

269
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:51,020
That those are the topics they chose to do, but they were completely legitimate at the time.

270
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,420
And by the way, they're pretty close to state of the art right now.

271
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:02,540
OK, so that's one thing I would like to say about the timeliness of our program or the timelessness.

272
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:16,740
If this program ASAP, you know, the physics would have been different back in the in the 50s and 60s, or if this was being done in the 2000 70s and 80s.

273
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:26,540
What is being covered in this book and what Arrow has been mandated to do by Congress is timeless.

274
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:33,060
In other words, you will be doing the same thing, regardless of the time frame.

275
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:42,660
It's just that I'm sure it configurations, if there are any further configurations, there could possibly be of craft will be available in the future.

276
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:50,820
But, you know, triangles have been seen back into the into the 60s, and I'm sure will be seen into the future.

277
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:58,420
Flying saucers, even craft that look like something from the Jetsons have been seen.

278
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:04,100
You know, the the flying saucer with a big bubble on it with with occupants.

279
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:12,500
That's all the same. In other words, if if if you look at ASAP and study what's in ASAP and try to answer some of the

280
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:20,100
questions, you're you're you're not wasting your time.

281
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,220
In other words, there there there there's a timelessness to it.

282
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:34,100
All right. So we hit we hit some technical problems, which is not strange for us.

283
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:40,260
But we got we got George Knapp here on the phone and we're just getting, you know, back down to the point.

284
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,460
So, George, I was asking you, help me this guy, Lakatsky, he's being a little dodgy as a reporter.

285
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:52,820
I can't nail him down. We're talking about why these why our government would or why he can't talk more about this.

286
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,220
So I don't know. Help me out, George.

287
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,980
Well, Jim is the rocket Gibraltar.

288
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:03,260
He's not going to answer that question for you. If he's decided not to answer it, he's not going to.

289
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,100
I was thinking maybe there's another way in. We could go around the corner here.

290
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:13,660
Let's start with Colum. Colum, this book is so much different from Skinwalkers at the Pentagon.

291
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,780
And that was not an idle decision.

292
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:27,900
Jim had used the phrase earlier in this conversation, nuts and bolts, which you will recall you and I were kicking around ideas for a possible title for the for the book.

293
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:35,020
And nuts and bolts came up. But we didn't think that having the word nuts in a UFO book was a good idea.

294
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:41,900
Well, you know, the point is, you know, that first Skinwalkers at the Pentagon had a lot of weird stuff.

295
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:50,340
And people think, well, maybe we made a mistake by including all those stories of strange paranormal type events that were highly criticized.

296
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,980
But in fact, that was part of the focus of OSAP.

297
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:00,980
Why why this different approach this time? What distinction is being made here?

298
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:15,060
Well, the critical part of OSAP that we tried to convey in Skinwalkers at the Pentagon was that there were two fundamental parallel tracks that OSAP ran on.

299
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:20,660
The first one was the the examination of UFO performance.

300
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:36,180
And, you know, the UFO performance part was getting all of the data from eyewitnesses plus deploying sensors into the field in order to gather data on the performance of UFOs.

301
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:44,260
That was track number one. And track number two was what effects do UFOs have on humans?

302
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:53,460
That was a parallel track that from the get go, OSAP decided unambiguously to run both tracks in parallel.

303
00:25:53,460 --> 00:26:03,700
Skinwalkers at the Pentagon focused a lot of its reporting on the second part, which is the effects of UFOs on humans.

304
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:13,580
So that, you know, to summarize that book, we looked at a variety of effects on humans that included medical effects.

305
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:20,020
We documented several medical effects, pathological effects, physiological effects.

306
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:28,260
You know, the people people having weird metallic taste in their mouth, sometimes hair loss and a whole bunch of other things.

307
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,540
We documented psychological effects and then we also documented paranormal effects.

308
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:43,300
So all of these under the rubric of, you know, effects on humans were reported in Skinwalkers at the Pentagon.

309
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:53,860
A lot of the pushback that we got from that book was that these guys were using taxpayers money to camp out on Skinwalker Ranch and,

310
00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:01,180
you know, basically document Dogman, dino beavers and a whole bunch of other weird stuff.

311
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:07,700
Whereas, in fact, that was only a very minor part of the entire OSAP program.

312
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,420
So the purpose of the second book is to balance that whole thing out.

313
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:21,220
And so we unambiguously focused the reporting on the initial, you know, initial revelations.

314
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:29,900
The second book on the nuts and bolts aspects of the UFO phenomenon, which was half of what OSAP was doing.

315
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:40,700
So the purpose of the second book is really to look at the UFO performance angle strictly from the from only the performance angle.

316
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:51,060
You know, things things like, you know, lift, propulsion, power generation, spatial temporal translation, configuration,

317
00:27:51,060 --> 00:28:03,340
a whole bunch of other aspects of UFO performance that is translatable into theoretical physics, eventually into engineering.

318
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:16,420
In the only other interview you've given about the OSAP, you had said that the DIRTS essentially established a baseline for analysis.

319
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,380
It's a baseline of here's what humans are known to be able to do.

320
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,980
Here's what we think humans will be able to do in 50 years.

321
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:33,300
And when we look at UFO cases that you do in great detail in this book, it is clear that this is technology that we certainly didn't have 50 years ago.

322
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,780
That we don't have now.

323
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,580
And it's not even clear we will have 50 years hence.

324
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:44,220
This is a nuts and bolts UFO book, and it was a nuts and bolts UFO program.

325
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,060
Correct. Yes, absolutely correct.

326
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:58,380
Now, the thing is, is there have been again on the Internet, because anything can be said on the Internet, it seems factual or not.

327
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:12,820
Well, one thing that is not factual is DIA knew what it was getting into in regard to both aspects that Callum just described to you.

328
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,820
And let me end my statement right here.

329
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,620
We had no choice but to pursue both aspects.

330
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,380
Why?

331
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,380
I said I ended it.

332
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:35,660
Again, hey, let me tell you, Jeremy, you cannot compete with some of the offers that have been made to me.

333
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,620
I'm joking now, but this is factual.

334
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:52,940
Airplane tickets, speaker presentations, car rentals, hotel rooms pay for you just can't compete with all that.

335
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,580
I can throw in a steak dinner.

336
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,660
Oh, they've already done that, but you know what they always want.

337
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:05,620
Listen, listen, I am way more handsome and way more charming than any of those other people asking you to spill.

338
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,060
You know, the thing the thing is at the bottom line is what they all want.

339
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:18,940
And then when I hear the phone being clunked on me is when I say I cannot go beyond what is stated in the book.

340
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,660
Now, of course, now there are two books.

341
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,860
I can't go beyond that because it needs to.

342
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,980
Oh, that's OK. You gave us a great one.

343
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:34,660
You told us U.S. government is interested in UFOs, is studying UFOs, has been studying UFOs, is reverse engineering UFOs, has one and got inside of one.

344
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,620
Thank you. Thank you.

345
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,820
OK, so let me ask you about some current events here.

346
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,780
I really want to get your opinion on this.

347
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:48,460
So as we know, we're out in Congress and you saw like everybody else.

348
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,180
In fact, I mean, I'll spill the beans a little bit myself.

349
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,100
We were hoping you were going to testify in front of Congress.

350
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,740
You didn't. But David Grush did.

351
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,620
So I want to ask you your opinion.

352
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:07,780
Here's a guy who says that he was looking at reverse engineering programs, black budget programs, and has provided a whistleblower statement through the Presidential

353
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:15,900
Protection Act, came forward and told us all these things that he believes them to be true from his investigations into 40 witnesses.

354
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:24,700
And that has been corroborated by being labeled urgent and credible by our inspector general of intelligence, what David Grush said.

355
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,140
So what are your thoughts on David Grush and what he said at that hearing?

356
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,100
I don't know, Mr. Grush, never met him.

357
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:44,340
I was asked almost verbatim the same question by a congressional office to me, a telephone conversation.

358
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,020
And I said, I don't have a comment.

359
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,900
What he's saying is credible.

360
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,580
Now, let me do say one thing that I never witnessed.

361
00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:02,460
And I don't know if Collin ever witnessed this, but I never saw any what I would consider illegal activities.

362
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:08,180
I saw security procedures that are paramount, but not illegal activities.

363
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,700
So I don't concur with that.

364
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,420
But it's reasonable what he's saying.

365
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,020
And that's what I told.

366
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,900
Okay, it's reasonable.

367
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:27,420
It's reasonable that we have UFOs, reverse engineering, that there are biologicals associated with those biologicals because I can't say anything about that.

368
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,380
Why can't you say you don't know or?

369
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,940
I can't say anything about that, Jeremy.

370
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,940
Okay, no, that's great.

371
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,180
So just another question about that.

372
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:48,020
Well, let me tell you, these books are loaded with questions because someone criticized me, gave me a three rating on skinwalkers at the Pentagon.

373
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,740
Why do they read this one?

374
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,020
They said it's textbook like.

375
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,740
Well, in a sense, they are.

376
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,100
They're a learning instrument.

377
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:06,740
And one thing, and I don't know if I discussed this with you, Collin, but I was going to put like a textbook questions in the back of each chapter.

378
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,860
What do you know?

379
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,780
What do you think?

380
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,500
And what do you just further for now?

381
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,460
I wasn't going to give an answer sheet to them.

382
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:21,620
But basically, I think that people really need to delve deeper into the books they have.

383
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:29,180
And, you know, I personally love hard copies, but at some point it's going to be hard to flip back and forth.

384
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,340
You obviously are well doing it well, Jeremy.

385
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,700
I always had trouble on an electronic copy of flipping back and forth.

386
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,420
I like hard copies.

387
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,740
Well, yeah, for sure.

388
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,460
Well, listen, however you get the information out, it's great.

389
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,580
So let me ask you this, though.

390
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,300
The big the big question with David Grash was they're like, well, he didn't see a UFO.

391
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,700
Now you're in a meeting in the Capitol Hill and you're telling them we have a UFO.

392
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,740
We've gotten inside of it.

393
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,540
Did you see it yourself and answer that?

394
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,220
OK, but if the answer was no, you could answer that, right?

395
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:06,380
No, that comes goes back to something that occurred.

396
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,220
A similar question, very similar to your question.

397
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,740
It wasn't asked by you, but it was asked to call him.

398
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,300
And he said, we found no smoking gun.

399
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:24,900
That is the standard answer we're to give is so I could say no, and it's still not be the truth.

400
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,620
So the thing is, is security is paramount.

401
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:35,340
We follow the rules and there's a good reason, a good reason to follow them.

402
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,980
Yeah, you can't tell me that good reason.

403
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,220
We've talked about that.

404
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,220
You can't give me a reason.

405
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,300
You can't give me that good reason.

406
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:51,060
But you're alluding to a really good reason why you can't tell me more about biologics, UFOs, exploitation.

407
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,020
You can only say what you said.

408
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:57,660
I get that. I wish you could give me a good reason because it makes me very suspicious.

409
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,780
It makes people like me very suspicious.

410
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,500
Like, what is it? Is the reason so dark?

411
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,100
Is it so disturbing?

412
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:10,460
I see. If you want my opinion on that, I see no darkness at all here.

413
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:24,940
Basically, OK, there was some considerable write ups on the skin walker at the Pentagon that our program was stopped due to religious concerns from the far right.

414
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,540
Well, if there were, I knew nothing about that.

415
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,700
I saw no evidence of that being true.

416
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,820
But people can say whatever they want on the Internet, apparently.

417
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:44,540
And that was not that was not I did not witness any of that.

418
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,860
And I think that that's come up in some of these congressional hearings.

419
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,220
George Sansevier in skin walkers at the Pentagon.

420
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,140
And and column has backed us up in public statements.

421
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:05,900
Both of you indicated that you were on the trail of reverse engineering, crash saucer, meta materials, weird stuff.

422
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,660
You went knocking at different places and the door was slammed in your face.

423
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,340
That sounds like you were looking for exactly what we're talking about right here.

424
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,100
Is that wrong? Of course not.

425
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,660
That was part of the program.

426
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:32,580
But I'm saying the door being slammed in our face wasn't because of of suspected demonic activities within this at all.

427
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:42,020
In fact, I would say there's evidence that this is something of a nature that.

428
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,740
Well, I better not say much more.

429
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:55,580
It's if if full human capabilities were known to us right now, it is not something that we need to fear.

430
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,620
And I do not I just don't believe it.

431
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,260
Maybe I'm influenced by my Catholic faith.

432
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,260
I don't know, but I'm optimistic.

433
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,780
I think everything heads toward good.

434
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:13,300
What do you mean by if full human capabilities were understood, it would be nothing to fear any, any.

435
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,620
We'll get into that later at some later point.

436
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:30,580
But our capabilities, as Colmwell knows, he's probably an expert in all of these areas, more so than me, is our capabilities are, are, are, are.

437
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:36,180
Have never been fully revealed, and we're we're still learning.

438
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,380
We've got a long way to evolve still.

439
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,380
George, what were you saying?

440
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,020
Well, there are two questions I've asked, and neither one of them were answered.

441
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,980
But the first one was, were the DURDS established as a baseline?

442
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,540
Because that's what has been said before they were a baseline by which we can measure that's that's correct.

443
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,660
Yes, they're a baseline.

444
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:14,780
Well, they're a baseline, but also the purpose of them was to project 40 to 50 years out in the future in terms of the best known projections by the sort of the best people at hand.

445
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:20,100
So they were a baseline, but they were also projecting into the future.

446
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:35,740
So they were a baseline, but they were also projecting into the future so that would be an attempt to look at UFO performance and then marry those to the projections, the baseline projections.

447
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:50,060
All right. Well, the second part of the question was, do we not in fact report in Skinwalkers at the Pentagon that you guys went knocking on doors asking about these materials, that the materials and I'm assuming we're talking about

448
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:56,620
crash saucer type stuff that was part of what the bass plant was modified to receive.

449
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:04,140
That was part of the contract that you were you were asked to prepare to receive certain materials that you never got and you went looking for them.

450
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,860
And that's when the door was slammed in your face column.

451
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,860
Am I characterizing that incorrectly?

452
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:22,780
Well, slightly, because the people who were moving forward on that were not they were working with the OSAP program, but they weren't part of the OSAP program.

453
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:29,900
Am I incorrect that you guys were looking for stuff?

454
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,500
Remember, George, there's always multiple doors.

455
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,780
There are always multiple ways of doing things.

456
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:47,180
So just because a door was slammed in our face, is that a common expression that we're using?

457
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,900
Is that all we can say?

458
00:39:49,900 --> 00:40:04,020
Remember, I and Colin became this are experts at taking higher classification material and describing it at lower classifications.

459
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,660
There is no contradiction between the two.

460
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,020
It's just that the lower classification isn't complete.

461
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,860
And I can tell you there is a lot of material here in both books.

462
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,180
It's not complete.

463
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,260
And it can't be at this point.

464
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,500
OK, well, we've dodged the question again.

465
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,300
Is you pursuing this material?

466
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,220
Were you trying to find this?

467
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:39,860
You know, part of your question is there's material and there's material.

468
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:44,180
Are you talking about material to be investigated?

469
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:52,100
In other words, pieces falling off flying saucers, or are you talking about full blown craft?

470
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,900
You know, there's a big difference.

471
00:40:53,900 --> 00:41:07,300
And I'm not so sure that I would ever characterize it that we were constructing facilities in order to look at full blown craft.

472
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:12,380
I mean, again, we're talking about a commitment of money.

473
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:19,100
Bob Bigelow went over well over and well and beyond commitment to the contract.

474
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:25,340
I mean, we stopped tracking a DIA, his losses at one point five million dollars.

475
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:29,060
Now, is he going to be constructing large facilities?

476
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:41,900
There's a lot of statements that have been made on the Internet that partially ring true, but ultimately aren't really true.

477
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,060
I mean, that's a large commitment of money on his part.

478
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:53,780
And as a contractor, he's responsible for having his supplying the facilities, not the government.

479
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,700
Right. But didn't he revert or didn't he retrofit Bigelow Aerospace?

480
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:07,500
I mean, Dr. Kelleher, maybe you could talk about this, but didn't he retrofit Bigelow Aerospace in hopes to gain either some materials or a full craft?

481
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,180
You've already told us that we have a full craft that we got inside it, that we've been reverse engineering within our government.

482
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,420
Didn't he want to be part of that and get some of that material?

483
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:33,500
Part of the contract was that, you know, DIA wanted a facility security clearance bestowed on some of the buildings associated with Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies.

484
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:43,540
And so in order to be accredited to achieve that facility security clearance, a lot of retrofitting was necessary.

485
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:50,420
So, you know, the National Security Agency got involved and all of these audits happened on a very regular basis.

486
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,940
So you had to dock the I's and cross the T's.

487
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:03,140
That was a part of the requirements of the contract that we had to perform.

488
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:12,980
That's a very different thing from, you know, building a hangar outside Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in order to receive a craft.

489
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:22,100
I mean, we were mandated by the contract in order to adhere to facility security clearance requirements.

490
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,060
OK, so let me let me just go one last time.

491
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:30,820
So basically, David Grush, what he told us, you both feel that that information is credible, right?

492
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,620
Is that what you implied?

493
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:45,780
It's credible, but I'm simply saying he worked with someone that I know and trust as the UAP Task Force leader.

494
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:56,460
And I think you should take his statements now, whether whether whether or not if we could just take a moment here.

495
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:06,940
I've observed to call him something that is I'm looking at it particularly in regard to UFOs and the paranormal.

496
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:23,060
There are people who have have written, have talked about things they are absolutely wrong about, but they totally believe it.

497
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,060
I mean, you can't call them liars.

498
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,860
They totally believe it.

499
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:35,260
Now, how many of those people that David Grush came across are fit in that category?

500
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,980
I could name a list of them right now, but I won't.

501
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:47,500
I mean, obviously, I, I, I, I respect their opinions, but I know what they're saying is false.

502
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,660
So it's a phenomenon now.

503
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:56,900
I certainly hope that does not spread across all topics on the Internet because we're in big trouble if that's the case,

504
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:03,300
because that means people are delusional, the correct word.

505
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,620
I'm not a psychiatrist or a psychologist.

506
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,580
I don't know what it is.

507
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:14,300
Yeah, but hold on, because we don't have Grush here to talk about, but he talks about program names.

508
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,980
He talked about program names.

509
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:21,700
He talked about holding locations of UFOs, which you've already admitted that we've got them and we've been exploiting them.

510
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,300
So he's talking about things that are very tangible and physical.

511
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:34,780
People that worked on UFOs, those programs, part of the 40 witnesses that came forward to him are people that actually work on these legacy UFO programs, which he says exist.

512
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,020
We've talked about it.

513
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,700
All the four of us have talked about it.

514
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:42,460
We know UFO legacy programs have existed, whether or not you can talk about it or not.

515
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,060
We know that they existed.

516
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:53,580
So just to give, you know, kind of looking at what he said, he's saying that there are individuals with direct first hand experience, not opinions they could be wrong or right about.

517
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,380
It's whether or not these programs existed and we have these crafts we've been working on.

518
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:06,660
OK, and I have seen in multiple cases what I would call can only call forged documents.

519
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,380
OK, so there's another thing we should talk about.

520
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,180
So what do you mean by that?

521
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:24,700
Forged. There are documents talking about programs that are not legitimate documents.

522
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:33,660
Within intelligence servers, within your industry, there are forged documents inside of our government's, you know.

523
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,180
Or what are you talking about, just on the Internet?

524
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,140
I'm talking about both.

525
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,460
Really? How could that happen?

526
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,820
Forged documents with inside our intelligence agencies?

527
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,660
They even covered this on an X-Files episode.

528
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:56,660
Every special access program has a counterintelligence officer.

529
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:59,740
That's their job.

530
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,300
You know, it's their job.

531
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:07,140
So, you know, you might say, well, wait a minute, Jim and then call them our counterintelligence officer.

532
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,620
No, we're not.

533
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,060
You know, there's no reason to be.

534
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:19,620
But if you're in a program, you have you have that person either assigned to you or you bring them in.

535
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:25,100
And there's a source of forged documents right there.

536
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:36,100
Have your listeners and readers go back through the UFO history and you'll see fingers pointing to others that

537
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:42,580
again, I won't name them that, hey, this is all fabricated and.

538
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,180
Yeah, like Rick Doty, that's who you're talking about, maybe.

539
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,900
Can't say.

540
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,580
Oh, hold on. Here's George. Here's George.

541
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,860
He's going to say something. Go ahead, George.

542
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:56,260
Which counterintelligence officer wrote this in Skin Markers at the Pentagon on page 152?

543
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,820
OK, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

544
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,380
He'll read it. 152.

545
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:08,460
Yeah. Sasha Mover and Jim Bell began knocking on doors beyond DHS to connect with, quote,

546
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:16,580
the keepers of the secrets in at least two other agencies in these meetings, which took place June, July 2011.

547
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:20,620
Sasha, Jim and colleagues were treated rudely and harshly.

548
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:24,740
Bell and Mover were repeatedly told no and hell no.

549
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:34,020
This left them convinced that advanced technology was sequestered under government supervision at aerospace contractor facilities.

550
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:42,780
As a result, the DHS facilities to Harvard Department of Homeland Security officials became very hesitant and even fearful of moving forward.

551
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:52,860
Perhaps these two only belatedly realized the unique game changing and earth shattering nature of the biggest secret ever kept by the United States.

552
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:56,980
Is that counterintelligence stuff or did you two guys write that?

553
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,820
Well, we wrote that and it was approved by the Pentagon and by DHS.

554
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,780
But the thing is, is that that's not what I'm talking about.

555
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:11,700
I'm talking about playing out and outforged documents that are shown as proof of something.

556
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:18,500
And it's it's it's been applied to us to that their documents.

557
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:24,460
I want to emphasize something I said on my first and only interview.

558
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,860
It was a closed program.

559
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,220
It operated very similar to a SAP.

560
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:41,580
The director, the director of analysis and my office chief and, of course, division chief knew about this program.

561
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,300
No one else did.

562
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:48,260
Now, I was also protected by the stovepipe nature of that.

563
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:53,020
I did not have to address political type questions.

564
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,820
I I was insulated, but they were, too.

565
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,340
They there was no one else.

566
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:06,180
People in the surrounding cubicles didn't know nothing was purposely being hid.

567
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:10,380
It was a closed stovepipe system.

568
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:15,060
And it needed to be it needed to be operated that way.

569
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:27,500
What I'm talking about here is documents that have that have risen up in the meantime that are out and out forgeries.

570
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,340
Again, I'm not saying why this was done.

571
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:38,140
I'm saying officially if this was a counterintelligence effort, it probably wasn't a very good one.

572
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:43,060
But the thing is, is there there's phony material out there.

573
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,900
And I we have no reason to do that.

574
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:53,380
And that's why, you know, we were questioned in the review of skinwalkers at the Pentagon.

575
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,260
Why did we list all the references?

576
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,580
Why? Because we have real references.

577
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:10,980
Whether or not people can see that because of all the material that's the proprietary information in those references is is another situation.

578
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:18,340
But the thing is, is we we we have our references and they're not fabrications.

579
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:26,340
They exist and they exist both in and outside of D.I.A.

580
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:33,860
So what I was trying to get to is that mass during that period, you confronted the keepers of the secrets.

581
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:36,700
You were on the trail of what the keepers of the secrets have.

582
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,860
The biggest secret in the history of the U.S.

583
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,580
government is how we described it in that book.

584
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,220
What do we talk about bits and pieces of metal here?

585
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:51,780
Are we your your crew, your team was on the trail of that stuff, right?

586
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,340
I mean, and are we wrong about that?

587
00:51:54,340 --> 00:52:00,780
Is that counterintelligence or did you come to believe that we really do have this stuff?

588
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:13,580
Well, I can tell you, George, that, as you know, those events in 2011 occurred after the OSAP program was shut down.

589
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:24,700
So OSAP was officially sort of stopped in terms of funding being received in September of 2010.

590
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:29,420
By December of 2010, we had a 90 day no cost extension.

591
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,900
And at that stage, the program was over.

592
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:41,140
There was a lot of interaction between different departments and different agencies subsequent to that regarding additional funding.

593
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:50,940
What you are referencing in the skinwalkers at the Pentagon occurred after the OSAP program officially was terminated.

594
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:57,820
And it involved a lot of negotiation and back and forth between different organizations.

595
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:04,380
One of those organizations that we worked with was DHS, as it says in that book.

596
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:10,460
And those those elements within DHS did their own version of due diligence.

597
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,100
And that's what's being referenced in that book.

598
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:20,460
I think what George is getting at is that you guys have already explained that you have gone off,

599
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:26,900
you know, after the people that are guarding these secrets that you did find that they're storing this stuff somewhere else.

600
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:39,620
I mean, is that, George, is that your point is that they've already said I think that they believe that those goods exist somewhere hidden in the bowels of defense contractors by the elements of the US government.

601
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,980
They think they're real.

602
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:48,860
The period that column is describing is when Jim and column and some of their colleagues were trying to find a new home for a version of OSAP.

603
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,540
Is that correct?

604
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,860
That is correct.

605
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:59,620
So on one hand, you're telling me there's disinfo even within intelligence servers and systems where you can cover up your programs.

606
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:05,180
But you're also telling me UFOs, our government knows that's why you did all those dirts and that we have them.

607
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,980
We've been inside of one of them.

608
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,060
You've admitted it now.

609
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:20,780
I don't know that anybody from the DIA, from your level of the intelligence agency running a UFO program has ever admitted publicly before that we have a UFO and have been inside of it, have been able to get inside of it.

610
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:23,460
That's a big deal, you guys.

611
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,540
Well, that still doesn't address George's question.

612
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,940
You know, you're not addressing any.

613
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:35,540
We're not.

614
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:38,900
I know you're dodgy.

615
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:46,020
Maybe we take a different tack and try to talk about the book in a general term and try to circle back.

616
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,180
We've mentioned about Arrow a couple of times.

617
00:54:49,180 --> 00:55:06,700
Jim, you and Colm have both said in a limited number of interviews that you believe that the data warehouse that was established by OSAP, the biggest UFO data warehouse in existence that we know of, that it was subsequently being put into use by U.S.

618
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,100
government agencies.

619
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,300
Is Arrow one of those agencies?

620
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:16,180
And if it is, have they reached out to you and Colm or can you say?

621
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:25,260
Because Arrow using the database that you guys created from OSAP, the largest UFO database in history, Jacques Vallée worked a lot with you guys on that.

622
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,860
Is Arrow using that?

623
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:30,540
Have they reached out to you about that?

624
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:35,380
On that particular issue, no, they have not.

625
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:50,620
But I know that the originator of, you know, the lead of the UAP task force from when Arrow evolved did have it.

626
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:58,580
So as for using it, it's it's more of a tool to get broad trends.

627
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:08,180
I mean, obviously, my broad trend observation is every car on the road is different if you look at the UFO database.

628
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:18,180
In other words, models don't that if there's if multiple craft are seen at the same time, yes, they can be duplicates.

629
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,380
But in general, everything is different.

630
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,260
That's something you use the database for.

631
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,100
Also, what do you make of that?

632
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,140
What do you make of that in general?

633
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:28,620
I'm sorry.

634
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,020
But what do you make of that?

635
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:36,500
I mean, there's some indications of what I could say, but I won't say yet.

636
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,100
I don't I think that that's odd.

637
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:43,980
And why is everything dissimilar?

638
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:49,460
You know, you have to that's you have there are a lot of things that you have to question here.

639
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:58,020
Why did why that mean in on regard to Skinwalker Ranch?

640
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,620
You've seen nothing yet, nothing.

641
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:06,020
I mean, you'd be flabbergasted at some of the occurrences there.

642
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:09,620
And yes, there is documentation for these.

643
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:14,940
Why? For what purpose?

644
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:24,180
And and I think it's very dangerous to commit to an answer that someone knows the solution or what's occurring.

645
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:36,900
I think it's why I can also going back to George's question, I can answer that also from my perspective.

646
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:49,100
You know, as you know, George, the the transition that occurred between the UAPTF and the various iterations of the UAPTF,

647
00:57:49,100 --> 00:58:00,780
that the transition to AOI MSG and then ultimately to AARO occurred under completely different leadership

648
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:06,060
and completely different circumstances than the original UAPTF.

649
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:18,340
So I was I was interacting with members of the UAPTF on a sort of a consultant, informal consultant basis.

650
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:28,260
And I know for a fact that they had access to the the electronic version of the database.

651
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:36,420
However, the transition that that occurred in the leadership of the UAPTF was very abrupt, as we know.

652
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:45,860
And the, you know, the transition that ultimately led to the formation of the AOI MSG was very abrupt.

653
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:51,380
And the leadership transferred into the USDA.

654
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:59,700
So once the leadership transferred into the USDA, AOI MSG ultimately became AARO.

655
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:16,540
And under those two leaderships of the USDA, I have no personal knowledge that the full OSAP database was used by AOI MSG or by AARO.

656
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:22,460
But I do know it was used by UAPTF.

657
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,740
I think we're dodging another bullet here.

658
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,500
I was trying to figure out if AARO had reached out to you guys.

659
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:35,380
Jim indicated that AARO has not reached out about the database, but they didn't say he doesn't say whether AARO has reached out at all.

660
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:40,980
I would think there are a few people in the world that have more expertise on this issue than Colm and Jim.

661
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:45,100
And I was just curious if I were running AARO, I would want to talk to you guys.

662
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:51,540
Have they reached out and tried to just establish a line of communications or are you able to say?

663
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:55,340
The reach out was on an unclassified network.

664
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,420
I would give you the answer.

665
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:02,660
Yes, for me.

666
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,300
Was it Dr.

667
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,860
Kirkpatrick, you guys, or was it somebody from his office?

668
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:13,700
Now, Jeremy's getting back to it was it was a person from his office.

669
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:24,700
In a position to reach out, I can say that, that as based on his background and his position, it was a proper contact.

670
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,100
Yes.

671
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:36,300
So you guys, the OSAP program is the largest acknowledged UFO program to the public, to the American public.

672
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,660
But we know there were other and are other UFO programs.

673
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:45,260
We'll get into the are other because on camera, you guys talked with me about that this study continues.

674
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:50,540
We'll get into that. But as far as legacy UFO programs, like what is your understanding of that?

675
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:54,420
Like David Grush talked about it. It's now public that there were these things.

676
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,380
Have you ever had experience with that, Jim?

677
01:00:56,380 --> 01:01:00,820
Have you been part of a of a UFO program, a legacy UFO program?

678
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:03,820
I couldn't say yes or no on that.

679
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:11,340
What I can say is that I am describing that which I was involved with, and that was OSAP.

680
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:16,100
And I have always said you must do what OSAP did.

681
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:22,340
You've got you have no choice but to do all aspects of what OSAP did.

682
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:27,060
Now, you might call it, well, was that fortunate that we did the right things?

683
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:30,180
Well, actually, looking back, yes, it was.

684
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:33,300
I'm kind of surprised we did what you need to do.

685
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:44,300
But any program that is truly looking into UAP paranormal has to do what we did and what we did.

686
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:50,980
And now put in another thing or may still be going on.

687
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:58,540
OK, so so as far as future looks at the UFO topic, the OSAP, it ended in the form that we know it.

688
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:03,020
But you have said to me directly and George on camera, we just haven't put that footage out yet.

689
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:07,180
Both of you that the program continues just under a different guise, a different name.

690
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,300
So that's what you're saying.

691
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:11,020
You're saying the two arrow.

692
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,340
Look, I know.

693
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,300
No, don't play with me with the arrow thing.

694
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,780
There's got to be something on that.

695
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,340
What was it? What is it?

696
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:22,460
Chapter, chapter two, the comparison between the two.

697
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:31,940
The only difference between OSAP and what has been mandated by Congress for Arrow is the high cost sensors.

698
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,460
We couldn't afford that.

699
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:36,620
Now, we describe in the book.

700
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:40,020
In chapter and chapter, what is it?

701
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:43,140
Eighteen, the integrated sensor package.

702
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:50,860
Yes, we had our own design for a sensor package and there are other.

703
01:02:50,860 --> 01:03:02,900
Other individuals, entities that were interested in placing their own sensor packages with us.

704
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:06,340
Like NASA, like another agency, like who?

705
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:08,740
No, I can't say.

706
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:15,300
You'd say, I mean, would have been the same equipment while they may have had resources that we didn't.

707
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:22,100
Ours was kind of something we could place at multiple locations.

708
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,980
OK, so let me just ask you, both of you can answer this.

709
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,460
This is just your opinion.

710
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:30,900
So we know that Project Blue Book ended in 1969 and they said nothing to see here.

711
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:35,660
Move on. We do not believe that the UFOs pose a national security threat.

712
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,860
We now know that that was a lie just because of OSAP.

713
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:44,020
Even if you don't admit another legacy program, we know that we were studying UFOs and funding it.

714
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:45,540
Let me ask you this.

715
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:52,700
That excuse that was given back in 1969 with the closing of Project Blue Book that they don't believe there's any national security threat.

716
01:03:52,700 --> 01:04:02,140
I can't imagine a world where the DIA would be funded for the Defense Warning Office for something like OSAP if they didn't believe that there was a national security threat.

717
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,700
So my question is to you.

718
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:11,140
Do you believe UFOs represent a national security threat?

719
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:19,540
Well, lack of knowledge always can.

720
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:23,380
I mean, directly a direct threat.

721
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:33,900
Well, is it something that you can do something about or not do something about or there's so many qualifiers to this question and to the answer.

722
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:40,900
It's almost like we're getting into an endless.

723
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:48,660
Well, I can I can step in here because that question has been posed to me multiple times.

724
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:52,340
And, you know, threat has two components.

725
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:56,420
One is capability and the second is intent.

726
01:04:56,420 --> 01:05:04,100
And we had the OSAP program generated gobs of data on UFO capability.

727
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:08,540
We generated almost nothing on UFO intent.

728
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:25,660
And unless you have both, and I was lectured pretty strongly by one of the one of the consultants to OSAP, you cannot make the case that without without data on intent,

729
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:32,780
you cannot make the case that these objects are a threat to national security.

730
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:37,660
What you can say is that they are a threat to human health.

731
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:42,980
And we made that statement in at the end of the OSAP program.

732
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:51,260
We we generated a fairly large summary of all of the data that pointed in that direction,

733
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:57,980
including medical injury cases, including a lot of pathological cases and physiological cases.

734
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:02,380
And, yes, we did say that UFOs are a threat to human health.

735
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,620
Are they a threat to national security?

736
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:06,580
We do not know.

737
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:13,740
We did not accumulate any data regarding UFO intent.

738
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,740
I'm going to pull George here, George.

739
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:21,140
So read in their book over the last few days, they talk a lot in the book.

740
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:30,780
You guys talk a lot about Calaris in Brazil and how for decades that human beings were being physically harmed to the point of death.

741
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:35,700
So from UFOs and that their military studied it, is this like a case?

742
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:42,020
And that also OSAP, you're going to reveal in a future book, did actually do an in-depth investigation about Calaris.

743
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:48,060
So my question is, OK, maybe not national security, but in this case, the UFOs were fucking people up.

744
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:51,540
They were hurting them to the point, sometimes to death.

745
01:06:51,540 --> 01:07:01,540
So are you telling me with your book and all this information that UFOs do pose a physical threat a lot of times to people like in Brazil?

746
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,900
Yes, absolutely.

747
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:10,500
And that's one of the reasons that we were trying to complete the database in regard to Brazil.

748
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:23,780
And it's simply that that if that was occurring here in the US, let me tell you, every day you'd see a front page article that did not occur.

749
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:29,620
But, you know, there's there's I don't want to go into something I'm unfamiliar with that is an OSAP in nature.

750
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:43,380
But there's there's current problems now in in in South America, you know, and you probably know more about that, Jeremy, about what appear to be, again, threats.

751
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:51,060
Yeah, you hear that. But, you know, it's not as studied as what you guys were able to.

752
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:55,420
Calaris and the surrounding areas, correct. But that.

753
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:07,660
So anybody. Yeah, anybody that reads your guys book, just so our audience knows, basically, there's a bunch of dedication of pages into these bizarre events in Brazil.

754
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:16,900
They were studied by the Brazilian military where these UFOs for decades were harming, murdering, burning, messing up human beings.

755
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,700
This is not just like, oh, these great space brothers.

756
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:23,900
This is something that was really devastating to these communities and left them in terror.

757
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,940
So I suggest people check that out.

758
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:32,980
I would agree with you, Jeremy, and I think even beyond the Brazilian cases,

759
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:43,260
I think we accumulated enough cases within the United States to say that, you know, if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time,

760
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:51,580
in terms of proximity to UFOs, in terms of proximity to blue orbs that you can come off the worst,

761
01:08:51,580 --> 01:09:02,020
you'll have a lot of symptoms that mimic radiation sickness, for example, you know, metallic taste in the mouth, sunburn.

762
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:06,340
Your hair starts falling out. We documented these cases.

763
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:17,180
And if you add that to the events in Calaris, you can make the statement that UFOs are really bad for your health.

764
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:23,860
I would also ask, you know, I think the strength of this new book is the is the examples that you guys use,

765
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:29,620
that we use to to document and demonstrate certain principles.

766
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:36,620
Why engineering principles, physics principles of how strange this technology is, how advanced it is.

767
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:39,540
One of the cases that comes up is a military case.

768
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:45,020
And I'd remind our listeners that, you know, the Tic Tac case was an OSAP, a bass investigation.

769
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:50,780
It started with OSAP. Later on, iterations of other UFO programs looked into it.

770
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:58,540
But OSAP started that investigation off and you had another investigation into a military encounter at Lake and Heath.

771
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:07,700
Colin, can you share with our listeners what some of the details about that Lake and Heath case and what stood out that made it interesting to you?

772
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:20,780
Well, I think it was mostly because it was a again, it was a military situation with the RAF, Lake and Heath,

773
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:31,020
got a bunch of unknown signals regarding something that needed to be checked out.

774
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:40,580
There were two fighter jets that came very, very close and personal with an object that had no aerodynamic surfaces,

775
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:47,100
that looked like basically, you know, the raw ingredients of a meteor.

776
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:52,500
It was tracked both on the ground and by the fighters.

777
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:59,700
And they made several passes with this and they had communication, constant communication with ground control.

778
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:04,900
And, you know, the upshot of this thing was that an object was flying.

779
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:09,900
It did not seem to react to their presence. They came up close and personal.

780
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:19,700
They had visual confirmation. They had radar confirmation, you know, in other words, instrumented and sensor confirmation of this object.

781
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:25,020
And it was nowhere near as spectacular as the Tic-Tac,

782
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:33,300
but it was certainly an unknown flying object in the vicinity of RAF, Lake and Heath.

783
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,020
And very similar to.

784
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:49,340
You know, one of the things that we sort of focused on in the book was correlating some of the aspects of UFO performance,

785
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:55,740
like lift and propulsion, power generation, spatial temporal translation.

786
01:11:55,740 --> 01:12:03,300
And we generated a bunch of different cases from the historical literature.

787
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,020
And you'll notice a lot of those cases are old cases.

788
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:15,580
So one of the things that, you know, a lot of modern cases are thrown up against is, you know, these could be drones.

789
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:25,620
These could be, you know, these could be sort of, you name it, either commercial drones or Chinese spy drones or whatever.

790
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:33,340
But, you know, back in the 1950s or 1960s, a lot of these cases are pretty pristine.

791
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:38,980
And, you know, I'm thinking, for example, of the RB-47 case that we cite in this book,

792
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:45,780
which is an absolute classic case that Brad Sparks investigated.

793
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:50,100
And a lot of write ups, AIAA actually did a write up on it.

794
01:12:50,100 --> 01:13:02,580
And this was a classic case of RB-47 aircraft down in Texas, Louisiana area that was flying electronic countermeasures equipment

795
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:14,420
and had this visual sighting, instrumented sighting, radar sightings of this UFO that essentially outgunned them, outmaneuvered them.

796
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:17,620
And this was all the way back in July of 1957.

797
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:22,380
So you cannot say this was a Chinese high speed drone.

798
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:28,620
And the level of documentation on that case really is illustrative of, you know,

799
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:34,860
the properties that we cite in the OSSOP study regarding Lyft.

800
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:37,180
Jim, same sort of question.

801
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:42,140
I know we're sort of hair splitting here on the terms of national security threat.

802
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:51,780
But when you have these unknown objects dancing around over our base at Lakenheath or interacting with in the area of the Nimitz and the Princeton,

803
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:59,940
flying around with impunity, it's not attacking U.S. cities, it's not using laser beams to wipe out New York or Washington, D.C.

804
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:07,580
So maybe it's not considered a strategic threat, but it certainly has to be considered of interest to our national security interests

805
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:15,100
when it shows such an ongoing fascination with military facilities, personnel and equipment.

806
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:28,100
Oh, yes. But the thing is, we're investigating them probably properly now.

807
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:39,620
It's true that the Lakenheath incident did not involve near collision.

808
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:49,580
The ones since 2014-15 perhaps involved more of that, but again, probably not deliberate.

809
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:56,420
So, yes, you should be investigating that. It's more or less interference in flight.

810
01:14:56,420 --> 01:15:05,820
You certainly wouldn't want an airliner to have one of these be sucked into an engine intake.

811
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:10,620
They're rather large, relatively speaking.

812
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:14,740
So, yes, it should be investigated.

813
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:22,460
And that's why I believe Arrow exists right now, is that's a starting point.

814
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:31,340
As for investigating many of these civilian cases, it needs to be done.

815
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,740
There's a need to be done by the government.

816
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:45,260
I believe the contractors are fully capable, but there needs to be certainly a database that needs to be up kept and also constructed properly.

817
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:52,300
I think Colum hasn't mentioned this yet, but we do mention in this book, more than mentioned,

818
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:57,100
it's a couple of chapters, the Vali Davis system of categorizing.

819
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:01,820
You know, you can have a database and it's just a bunch of data.

820
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:11,420
Unless it's categorized properly and be able to be searched on, then you can see trends.

821
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:20,700
And that's what we did with the Capella database, the Capella Bass database.

822
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:26,660
So, yes, it's huge, but it is searchable.

823
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,260
I want to read something from your book.

824
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:37,900
So when you talk about future work in your book, you make eight suggestions, a couple of which are establish a data facility liaison for operations,

825
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:44,860
collect and analyze uncorrelated target data, which would be from like NORAD.

826
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:51,820
This is something that a friend of mine in Georgia is a journalist named Chris Sharp has really dug into, which is he's getting information from them.

827
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,900
Well, we don't keep any UFO data.

828
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,180
We do keep uncorrelated target data, though.

829
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:58,380
Where do they put that?

830
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:03,500
So you would like to see all that come in, be able to analyze what they call uncorrelated data,

831
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:10,620
which is things that do propel through the sky with intention, but we can't correlate it to our own craft.

832
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:13,620
So you'd like to see that data come in in future studies.

833
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:20,820
But one thing you said, when you guys gave the eight different suggestions for future work,

834
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:25,380
you talk about collection of oral and written histories.

835
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:28,740
Now, let me just read you what you wrote two sentences.

836
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:45,660
It says collect under appropriate security caveats, oral and written histories from individuals with firsthand exposure to apparent exotic technologies and or circumstances surrounding the same.

837
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:58,300
This would include seeking out and contacting military and civilian personnel, scientists and engineers and companies that may already have had access to firsthand data concerning novel technologies.

838
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:07,700
So in writing that, you got to know that there are corporations, companies, military individuals who have direct firsthand experience in this exploitation program or programs.

839
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:19,300
But you're reading something exactly that was in the both proposal and which I don't think will ever be released.

840
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:26,380
The proposal from Bass and also the program planning documents for the startup of ASAP.

841
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:28,580
That's direct wording from that.

842
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:31,660
That was a hope that we could do that.

843
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:35,980
So I wouldn't I wouldn't say in other words, I wouldn't put too much.

844
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:43,300
Well, that's a that's a statement based upon knowledge, but a statement based upon desire.

845
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:48,300
In other words, that those those are exact words from the doctor.

846
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:52,940
I should say, you know, since S.A.T.P.

847
01:18:52,940 --> 01:19:00,900
Skinwalkers, the Pentagon was a compilation document, it was written on our new book.

848
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:07,580
We tried to keep with editing, of course, we needed to edit or edit the grammar and the spelling.

849
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:17,660
We tried to keep as close to the original language that was in our documentation that DIA received.

850
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:30,780
And the reason for that is I want your listeners and the readers of this document to understand they're in the same management shoes or position that we were.

851
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:34,780
This is the document that really came in.

852
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:43,420
So I wouldn't put too much into the statement you you read because it was used as a plan.

853
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:54,140
And as I said, these plans never came to fruition mainly because one, the core items were completed in the two years.

854
01:19:54,140 --> 01:20:00,500
And two, it would have required more money and more personnel.

855
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:06,020
To do them. OK, fine, fine, fine.

856
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:12,580
But Jim, like, do you think the American public deserves to know about the ultimate reality,

857
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:18,740
the fact that there are appear to be nonhuman intelligence flying spacecraft or something that looks like them?

858
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:22,380
That's why we're doing we're doing these books.

859
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:29,420
We're trying. So you believe the American public has a right to know within the security limits.

860
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:32,940
Within security limits, security comes first.

861
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:37,100
But the thing is, is national security comes first.

862
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:49,380
But that's why we're assembling these books and we're trying to accurately assemble them based on real references that may or may not be available to the public.

863
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:56,780
But you're getting direct extracts from these these references.

864
01:20:56,780 --> 01:21:01,340
No, it's great. I just wanted to see where you stand on that UAP transparency or not.

865
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:04,660
I mean, we've got to crack the egg. Am I a disclosure advocate?

866
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:08,700
The answer is no. What's the difference in your mind?

867
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:12,700
The difference is security. You know, there's certain things.

868
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:19,740
Oh, and now if this involves security plus.

869
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:25,060
Because having come from the contractor world in the first half of my career,

870
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:30,540
I can say if there's heavy investment of contractor capital,

871
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:38,380
their overhead money into technologies and they've been given these technologies,

872
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:42,500
they're going to hang on to them. It's just like, hey, wait a minute.

873
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:50,060
We've invested a lot of our personal resources into research and that can apply to every topic.

874
01:21:50,060 --> 01:22:00,460
It's going to be difficult to pry loose technology when something's been given over and a private company has invested their money,

875
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:03,980
their stockholders money into research.

876
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:07,780
So that's an entirely different aspect. But ours is security.

877
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:12,100
We're trying to release it for you. But doesn't it doesn't it drive you crazy?

878
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:17,620
I mean, I get it. There's security. I get it that private companies were given something, have invested a lot of money.

879
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:25,060
But isn't this topic kind of bigger than these issues, those two issues, the fact that we might not be alone?

880
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:31,580
Well, yes, but I think that we can convey that through the proper method.

881
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:35,140
And that's what we're trying to do.

882
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:40,020
OK, so you are trying to convey that in the proper way.

883
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:52,820
I'm not going out there and interviewing with everybody to say what I really feel.

884
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:57,980
No, it was hard to get you to do this. I mean, I can testify you're not doing it in an improper way.

885
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:07,380
People hang up on me when I say you can offer me all of this, but I'm not going to say anything more than what's been approved.

886
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:10,500
So let me get back to George here. So, George, what do you think?

887
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,260
Are we cracking the egg here with Jim and Colin?

888
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:18,980
Oh, not even coming. Not coming close. Here's another tack we could take.

889
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:26,860
Jim, Dr. Kasky, I believe that you have made it clear that you were in contact with Congress.

890
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:30,580
I know that you were asked about testifying and you declined.

891
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:39,300
Do you feel that telling Congress all of what you know would constitute a possible threat that, you know,

892
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:47,420
a mutual friend of ours of mine and yours and columns has said it many times, you can't tell your friends without telling your enemies.

893
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:56,340
Well, do you think that telling Congress the lowdown on things that you really know but can't say here would represent a likely threat

894
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:01,940
that that would be that information would be linked to our adversaries and enemies?

895
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:11,580
That's my personal belief. I mean, there's two things I said, and that's in response to your mention of Congress contacting me.

896
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:22,140
One, and I repeated this to multiple folks, I don't want to get involved in what would appear to be a three ring circus right now.

897
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:30,380
It's just it's too much for me. That's why I'm devoting and I don't want I don't get involved in answering things in Twitter,

898
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:34,660
which I easily could or read it, which I easily could.

899
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:43,580
I want it to be documented in these DOD approved books. That's my method of saying what I have to say.

900
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:51,900
Do I have a lot more that I could say and that will be seen perhaps if it's approved?

901
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:56,460
Yes. I mean, I can tell you with skin walkers at the Pentagon,

902
01:24:56,460 --> 01:25:06,940
they had a number of comments that I felt were really legitimate security observations that it needed to be changed.

903
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:11,580
But did the story still come through? Absolutely, yes.

904
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:17,340
You mean, what's the old saying? There's there's more than one way to skin a cat, whatever that means.

905
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:23,140
But there's there's just there are multiple ways of doing it.

906
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:28,740
And we're trying to calm and I and George are trying to now George is good at pushing.

907
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:32,900
And so are you, you know, push the limits, push the limits.

908
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:42,540
Well, we can write whatever we want, but if it doesn't get by by Dobson, DOD review, then, you know, we're kind of wasting our time.

909
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:55,140
I think we know what are our red lines not to cross and going to Congress would be a red line to me personally because I I talk too much.

910
01:25:55,140 --> 01:26:00,140
I say too much, but I purposely cut it off right here.

911
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:03,860
I just. Well, what if you what if you were subpoenaed, though?

912
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:06,460
I mean, you know, they're trying to do that in Congress.

913
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:10,860
They're trying to subpoena people and say, hey, Dr.

914
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:17,380
Dr. Lucas, you know, you've heard rumors about Dr. Lucas.

915
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:23,340
OK, but hold on. If you're subpoenaed and asked and asked to tell the truth, you're under oath.

916
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:26,620
First of all, right. Would you tell the truth phrase?

917
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:30,500
Let's cross that bridge when we come to it.

918
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:34,180
OK, George, I'm laughing so hard right now, George.

919
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:40,820
I wish you were on video. So, George, I was thinking, do you have I want to bring column into something that was written in the book.

920
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:43,940
It sounds like something column has tried to answer for me before.

921
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:46,140
It's about the nature of the phenomenon itself.

922
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:50,340
So let me read that, George, from the book. Cool.

923
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:55,660
OK, guys. So when we're talking about what we know about UFOs, George and I have talked about this a bunch.

924
01:26:55,660 --> 01:27:01,220
What do we know? OK, we know that UFOs represent a huge amount of energy in a small amount of space.

925
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:04,740
That's that's been proven. However, what do we really know?

926
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:09,580
And you guys have something in your book that is just it's just a couple of sentences or one sentence.

927
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:13,580
It was so profound to me. And I want to hear you guys elaborate on it.

928
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:25,020
It says everything works as if UAP were the product of a technology that integrates physical and psychic phenomenon

929
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:38,020
and primarily affects cultural variables in our society through the manipulation of psychological and physiological parameters in the witness, in the witnesses.

930
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:44,700
Can you guys expand? That's a huge statement. Can you expand on that?

931
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:59,420
Well, I know that a lot of that that statement comes at least from my personal experience with spending hundreds of days on Skinwalker Ranch.

932
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:11,620
And as we've gone over before, you know, Skinwalker Ranch had both nuts and bolts, objects, shiny metallic objects.

933
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:20,340
It also had a plethora of very unusual phenomena. There was a lot of evidence that was gathered

934
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:26,820
and some that I saw personally involving the manipulation of perception.

935
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:39,580
And so there is a lot of really good work and really good documentation regarding the manipulation of perception by people like Jacques Vallee.

936
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:47,660
You know, even Whitley Strieber has written in his latest book, there is a lot to do with manipulation of perception.

937
01:28:47,660 --> 01:29:05,180
So a technology that is both influential in terms of, you know, leaving an imprint on the ground that you can extrapolate that this thing weighed two and a half tons to altering people's psychic makeup.

938
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:14,700
There's really no contradiction there. I mean, you've got to be able to harness and work with ambiguity if you're working with the UFO topic at all,

939
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:22,460
because putting them into one box, you know, the nuts and bolts box or only the psychic box just doesn't work.

940
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:33,660
You've got to balance the idea that a technology can manipulate human perception and even from a long term perspective,

941
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:41,380
manipulate human cultural phenomena as well as, you know, operate as a machine.

942
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:50,700
So you've got to you've got to hold those two balls in the air. And if you're not capable of doing that, you should not be looking at UFOs.

943
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:59,940
Yeah. It's you know, a lot of people have filed FOIA requests, you know, based on skinwalkers at the Pentagon.

944
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:08,020
We listed all those reports that were produced by OSAP and BAS. And, you know, there's some great stuff, as we know.

945
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:15,300
But, you know, people write to the DIA and the responses they get is we don't have it.

946
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:27,620
There is no such report. For example, there's an analysis that is referenced in skinwalkers at the Pentagon about an analysis of Tic Tac, for example, that case and a few others.

947
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:36,620
DIA's answer is we don't have it. It doesn't exist. Do you suspect that those documents will ever be made public?

948
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:51,340
That particular one, as you probably already know, was a complete document analyzing a Tic Tac object and a spherical object.

949
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:58,220
And it was done based on BAS capabilities at the time.

950
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:11,460
It actually is. Well, the way it was written was it had that plus background material on the Tic Tac.

951
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:21,220
And I would say that there was information in there that was personal information, not proprietary information.

952
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:29,340
We were using commercial software. Will that document ever be released? I don't know.

953
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:38,220
We can do pieces of it in a future book, but the analysis tool that was being used was state of the art at the time.

954
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:46,660
And you need the color aspect of it. Well, as probably your listeners and readers know, color is kind of expensive in any book,

955
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:55,420
especially books that are reaching the size that we're doing. So will it reach?

956
01:31:55,420 --> 01:32:03,500
They have the document, whether they've destroyed it. How do you destroy an electronic document?

957
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:14,460
That's unclear. Whether they would be willing to go through removing the personal information?

958
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:22,820
I don't know. I can't speak to that. The wording is probably wrong that the document doesn't exist.

959
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:33,580
Yes, it does. I mean, you had it in your hand. But the thing is, as for the public ever seeing the full document,

960
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:37,420
again, there's the color problem.

961
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:40,980
Hold on, hold on. So George, he just said, oh, does the document exist?

962
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:52,980
Meaning 140 plus page analysis of the tic-tac-toe that the world has never seen generated by the atmospheric object generated by the DIA.

963
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:58,620
You know, famously, George would have loved to have given that, you know, as a submission to Congress famously.

964
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:03,220
But the thing is, is Jim Murkowski just said, George, you had that in your hands.

965
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:09,820
So if the DIA is telling us some document doesn't exist, but you had it in your hands, George,

966
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:13,500
what does that mean for the fate of the document? Couldn't that just go out to the public then?

967
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,500
If they don't admit it exists.

968
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:24,700
There's the problem of having that personal information in there. Someone has to scrub it.

969
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,940
It is DIA's job to scrub it.

970
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,140
George would be willing to scrub it.

971
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:31,340
Oh, no, that's not...

972
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:34,260
George, okay, that was a rhetorical question, Jim.

973
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:37,860
So, George, just tell us what your thoughts are here.

974
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:48,180
Well, I could not. It's not my document to release and I wouldn't release it without permission from the people that allowed me to see it.

975
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:56,380
So I just couldn't do that because if I were to do that, I would never get access to documents again of that nature.

976
01:33:56,380 --> 01:34:01,460
So I can't do it, but I'd be happy to do it if somebody gave me the green light.

977
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:03,260
Yeah, if people weren't going to have problems.

978
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:12,260
Well, so, Colin, back to this basic thing, you've tried to talk with me before about the physical and the psychic nature of UFOs.

979
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:15,780
And you're saying, look, you got to be prepared for both if you're going to investigate this.

980
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:20,820
But that statement that you guys wrote in your book, it really is something I think people really need to pay attention to.

981
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:28,620
You're saying that everything works if UAP were the product of a technology that integrates physical and psychic phenomena.

982
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:37,300
But then you say, and primarily affects cultural variables in our society through manipulation of psychological and physiological parameters.

983
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:40,180
What do you mean manipulate cultural variables?

984
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:43,740
I'm sorry, I'm obsessed with this quote.

985
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:47,700
Well, do you want to take that, Jim, because I've already answered it?

986
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:53,580
Well, we see cultural variables.

987
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:58,100
Don't we see that occurring right now?

988
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:01,380
What do you mean? No, you're asking me that.

989
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:07,940
Basically, there's a well, I got it.

990
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:14,940
I got something to really reference and it'll be another little bombshell of mine.

991
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:18,340
But you're going to answer my question.

992
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:21,740
What is the purpose of the men in black?

993
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:32,420
We that is a question we have encountered the men in black, the legitimate ones, legitimate ones.

994
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:39,780
You have I didn't say me, but the answer the answer is yes.

995
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:47,940
What do you mean the legitimate people who are gaming gaming knowledge of the men in black?

996
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:50,260
But what is the purpose of the men in black?

997
01:35:50,260 --> 01:36:03,220
Is it to draw attention away from the UFO phenomenon or using reverse psychology, draw attention to it and the paranormal, of course?

998
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:05,700
What is the purpose?

999
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:08,060
It could be their polar opposites.

1000
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:13,060
The answers that's always been the men in black.

1001
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:20,220
Dissuade, do they knowing human psychology, do they or do they do exactly the opposite?

1002
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:23,420
They draw attention to the phenomenon.

1003
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:26,620
And that's what I mean in my answer to you.

1004
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:34,220
I wanted to use an example of manipulating cultural variables that they're drawing attention.

1005
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:36,380
Hey, this really exists.

1006
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:42,780
Now, you can also go off on the side a little bit is say, are we in the realm?

1007
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:46,180
Because I've been I've talked to multiple people about this.

1008
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:53,420
Are we in the realm of what we would consider demonic influence?

1009
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:54,820
Have we crossed into that?

1010
01:36:54,820 --> 01:37:01,220
That's a cultural variable to operating at the same level.

1011
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:03,020
We've got to consider all this.

1012
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:10,780
That's why I think this is such a wonderful topic, because you've got all these things you still have to consider.

1013
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:16,700
And now I'm going to be long gone and Colin probably will be long gone and you'll be long gone.

1014
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:20,380
And they'll still be exploring all this and not have all the answers.

1015
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:28,380
But that's that's the manipulation from my point of view of, hey, get interested in this stuff.

1016
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:35,460
It's real. And don't just jokingly, you know, like the term dino beavers, you know,

1017
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:43,740
that Juliet and Colin saw a dino beaver.

1018
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:49,460
No one said that's just created to make a joke about about our efforts.

1019
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:58,020
But this is a real phenomenon, except it is such and you'll see that that was part of what DIA did.

1020
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:02,820
Collect data, collect data, collect that the Intel communities are great at doing that.

1021
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,900
But that's an answer to your question.

1022
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:09,820
And there's so many aspects of cultural manipulation.

1023
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:15,340
And I think it's positive manipulation.

1024
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:19,180
Using an I again, an old expression, the train has left the station.

1025
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:24,660
No, it hasn't. These books are proof that people can still get on the train.

1026
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:30,140
But those who laugh and joke don't bother getting on the train because, you know,

1027
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:35,300
you just you're not learning anything from the experience.

1028
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:40,020
So, George, Dr.

1029
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:44,380
Katsi just gave us a good answer, but I did notice when he was telling us that he said

1030
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:47,780
something about the real men in black and that he's actually met him or something.

1031
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:51,420
Can you can you just we can't let that go after you said to let it go?

1032
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:54,060
You have to let it go.

1033
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:56,540
But now the false men in black.

1034
01:38:56,540 --> 01:39:04,900
Now, there was an incident, and I'm not going to go into the incident, but column is aware of this.

1035
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:09,700
There was an incident of a false men in black.

1036
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:14,340
And let's assume they were working for some government agency.

1037
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:20,980
What they've never known and never has been revealed is a person they were interview obtained a gun.

1038
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:24,980
He was so afraid of them, he was ready to shoot out.

1039
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:28,220
If they made the wrong move, it would have been a disaster.

1040
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:36,020
It would have come back on us in some way, I'm sure, because I was asked in an interview once.

1041
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:38,060
What was your greatest fear during ASAP?

1042
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:43,860
And it was like it's tomorrow and the next day because there was always something that was happening

1043
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:47,140
that would come back and we had to fix.

1044
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:54,140
But we've never revealed that that this person was so afraid of the false men in black

1045
01:39:54,140 --> 01:40:01,420
that he had a gun tucked into his waistband under his sweatshirt.

1046
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:07,460
Were you guys the false men in black just going into another government agency?

1047
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:10,220
No, no, no, we were. We followed all the rules.

1048
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:16,980
We don't know. You don't know who you can trace back so far.

1049
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:24,540
But you can't if it was a counter intel operation by some organization, then it would have could have.

1050
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:28,100
I mean, that was a bad decision on their part.

1051
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:35,940
Bad. They shouldn't have pushed this fellow to that point where he was ready to resort to violence in defense.

1052
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:40,100
And he was in his own home being potentially threatened.

1053
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:46,740
Well, you know, I think there's a long history also of especially back in the 60s and 70s.

1054
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:58,060
I think everybody is aware of this, of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations having people out there

1055
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:04,820
trying to dissuade witnesses from talking to the media, threatening them.

1056
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:10,780
I think in the 50s and 60s, threats were much more overt than they would be now.

1057
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:17,820
But I think there's this this multiple arenas of men in black,

1058
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:29,540
all of which are sort of mutually supportive in driving paranoia in witnesses and in the field in general.

1059
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:33,580
And a lot of these are multiple agendas for different reasons.

1060
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:37,460
And some of them are mimicking the real men in black.

1061
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:39,500
Some of them are the real men in black.

1062
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:48,740
It's a I think it's one of these I would class it as another example of what I call bi-directional mimicry.

1063
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:53,380
OK, but the real men in black are we talking about humans or non-human intelligence?

1064
01:41:53,380 --> 01:42:00,780
What is the real men in black compared to just government agents being interrogating people?

1065
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:07,300
I think there's enough evidence in the literature to indicate that the phenomenon

1066
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:12,900
may be associated with some cases of what we call men in black.

1067
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:15,700
But what are they?

1068
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:17,940
Well, they're parts of the phenomenon.

1069
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:21,300
OK, so not just government agents walking around.

1070
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:29,340
Well, there's government agents that are also at the same time in parallel working on,

1071
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:32,060
you know, on intimidating witnesses.

1072
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:33,820
I know, but I'm not talking about the government.

1073
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:36,060
I'm talking about what you're calling the real men in black.

1074
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:39,140
I'm saying that they're part of the phenomenon.

1075
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:43,420
OK, I think there's enough I think there's enough data in the literature,

1076
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:51,300
especially if you go back all the way to the 1950s, to corroborate that statement.

1077
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:54,260
Even in the 1800s, there was a phenomenon like that.

1078
01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:58,500
If you read John Keel's Trojan Horse, Operation Trojan Horse,

1079
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:01,820
there's in the 1800s, there's a version of the men in black.

1080
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:04,340
Well, George, I am highly frustrated, as always,

1081
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:06,980
when I talk with Dr. Kelleher and Dr. Wachatsky.

1082
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:08,700
So what do you think, George?

1083
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:10,940
Where does this go from here?

1084
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:12,900
Well, there's a lot of great stuff in this book.

1085
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:16,660
I mean, you know, part of the a lot of criticism that came at us from

1086
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:18,860
skinwalkers at the Pentagon is too much woo.

1087
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:20,580
It's just too weird.

1088
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:24,060
And I always thought, you know, I was proud of what we did with that.

1089
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:30,700
And because it followed the evidence where it led and the people who were involved

1090
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:34,500
with OSAP, with BAST and some of their allies,

1091
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:38,020
looked at this without self-censorship.

1092
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:41,500
They didn't decide, hey, this is an interesting UFO case,

1093
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:45,500
but it's got this weird poltergeist angle, so we're going to toss that out.

1094
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:50,780
They had the courage to include it because it was necessary to look at the big picture.

1095
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:54,540
And that was where we started with the skinwalkers at the Pentagon.

1096
01:43:54,540 --> 01:43:56,780
This book narrows down the focus.

1097
01:43:56,780 --> 01:44:00,700
People have complained and griped and bitched and moaned that they want data.

1098
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:01,820
Here's some data.

1099
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:06,420
Here's the principles that are laid out in those dirts that started off the OSAP

1100
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:11,700
program, that the baseline projections of what we know now and what we hope will

1101
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:14,300
happen 50 years down the road.

1102
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:19,780
And then it has examples, real life examples, solid UFO cases from government

1103
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:24,140
files that were investigated and that remain really perplexing.

1104
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:31,060
And each of those cases, Jim and Colm have really deftly used to demonstrate a

1105
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:35,420
particular engineering principle, a physics principle, indicating that these

1106
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:38,380
things are real, that they are beyond our capabilities.

1107
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:42,020
They were certainly way beyond our capabilities when they happened and that

1108
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:43,420
there's a genuine mystery here.

1109
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:48,980
And it is, again, I think in very great detail demonstrates why this is a

1110
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:54,100
legitimate topic for investigation, that there's real things to consider.

1111
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:59,340
That there's physics and engineering, nuts and bolts, and case after case that

1112
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:02,740
demonstrates that this is a legitimate inquiry.

1113
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:03,780
That's my take on it.

1114
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:04,500
Very good.

1115
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:09,700
Totally agree, George.

1116
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:11,580
I guess we're on the right track, George.

1117
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:13,180
We're getting a double thumbs up here.

1118
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:16,620
Look, guys, I really appreciate it.

1119
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:20,140
I think if I take I have to kind of think about the people watching or listening to

1120
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:23,500
this, if I could take one thing away other than reading your book, which I

1121
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:28,580
suggest people do, but if I could take one thing away that really struck me, it

1122
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:34,100
is the first time in history, I think, that we have somebody of your, Dr.

1123
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:37,940
Lukatsky, of your kind of depth within the intelligence agency, the defense

1124
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:42,420
intelligence agency, and within the UFO program that you ran for the defense

1125
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:48,140
intelligence agency that stated, and I quote, the United States was in

1126
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:53,260
possession of a craft of unknown origin and had successfully gained access to

1127
01:45:53,260 --> 01:46:00,660
its interior, so you personally know about a UFO that we got access inside of.

1128
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:02,380
I have to assume, Dr.

1129
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:04,660
Lukatsky, that you've seen this bad boy.

1130
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:06,860
You don't got to answer me, but I'm going to make that assumption

1131
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:07,980
unless you tell me otherwise.

1132
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:13,980
You also say that this craft had a streamlined configuration suitable for

1133
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:19,060
aerodynamic flight, but no intakes, exhaust wings or control surfaces.

1134
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:23,020
So if I had to take something away from all of this, you just made the

1135
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:25,540
admission that our government is reverse engineering.

1136
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:27,980
If we got inside of it, we're reverse engineering UFOs.

1137
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:33,380
You see, I'm not speaking at all.

1138
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:37,220
I mean, I'm not going beyond what it was, what you read from the book.

1139
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:41,380
Okay.

1140
01:46:41,380 --> 01:46:42,540
Well, thank you very much.

1141
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:46,660
I do appreciate that you did put that in the book.

1142
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:47,660
Look, we have Dr.

1143
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:52,580
Eric Davis in the New York Times said craft, you know, not made here on earth.

1144
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:56,100
There are individuals like you have come out and pushed the envelope a little bit.

1145
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:57,020
And I thank you for that.

1146
01:46:57,020 --> 01:47:01,420
Even if you can't speak further from the book, that is a huge admission.

1147
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:03,700
I mean, that'll be the title of the YouTube video.

1148
01:47:03,740 --> 01:47:05,180
I mean, that's a huge admission.

1149
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:06,740
What do you think, George?

1150
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:11,340
I'd also say this is that I know that people in UFO world will be

1151
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:14,860
listening to this, pulling their hair out because Jim is very careful.

1152
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:19,340
And what he says, the fact is that that is why that is a big reason why he's

1153
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:23,020
been trusted with this information to start with, that he doesn't go blabbing

1154
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:26,460
and talk and reveal things that he's not supposed to talk about.

1155
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:32,260
And that's why I suspect he will continue to be trusted by our government.

1156
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:36,380
And hopefully there's going to be a future investigation or maybe one

1157
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:38,980
underway right now that he would be allowed to know about.

1158
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:44,580
I know it does get frustrating that we have the hair split and dance around

1159
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:48,580
certain of these cases and incidents and information, but.

1160
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:52,540
You know, that's part of, of who he is and why he got that job.

1161
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:57,460
You know, so it's, it's great always to talk with Jim on or off the record.

1162
01:47:57,500 --> 01:48:02,220
And with column, of course, they've helped me understand this big white world so much.

1163
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:06,460
And even though they've shared things with me that I can't say publicly, it

1164
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:11,140
has helped me so much in understanding who else is completely full of crap out there.

1165
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:12,860
Yeah.

1166
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:14,100
Yeah, for sure.

1167
01:48:14,260 --> 01:48:15,620
Well, thank you guys so much.

1168
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:19,260
I mean, you know, I think that with the limited things you can say, people

1169
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:22,540
should read your book and start to understand a little bit more about what

1170
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:26,300
OSAP did and how it did it, what the thought process was.

1171
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:27,500
I do appreciate that.

1172
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:32,100
And for, for, you know, just coming on the show and for help guiding, as George said,

1173
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:36,940
you know, what, what he knows is sometimes BS just from kind of getting to understand

1174
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:37,740
where you guys are coming from.

1175
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:38,660
So thank you for all this.

1176
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:59,380
Never have so few, have so much to tell, but could say so little.
