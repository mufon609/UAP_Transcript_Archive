1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Mysterious drones over New Jersey?

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,560
The nationwide sighting's a mysterious drone.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,800
Weeks of mysterious drone sightings.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,360
You're telling me we don't know what the hell these drones are in New Jersey are?

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:11,960
That's right.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,720
They're saying no threat, but how the hell do they know?

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,560
They don't know anything.

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,520
They don't know what it is.

9
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,680
They don't know where it come from.

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,120
Tip of the iceberg would be a gross understatement for that headline.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,120
More like tip of a sunken continent.

12
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,280
No, that ain't no plane, yo.

13
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,400
What the fuck is that, bro?

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,640
People in New York and New Jersey see drones the size of an SUV over their house every night

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,280
and think that that doesn't make any sense.

16
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,440
Certainly I understand why people would be looking at this and being concerned about it.

17
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
We're concerned about it, too.

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,560
The U.S. Air Force says they're drones.

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,720
Don't you fucking believe it?

20
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,400
The U.S. Air Force lies.

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,960
There was a drone just hanging out.

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,000
I put my drone up in the air and went towards it.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,640
Not three minutes into the flight, drones started going down dead.

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,480
These are fully charged batteries.

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,040
What's going on here isn't new, and these aren't all drones.

26
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,640
You see it? You see how it goes?

27
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,120
And they're not just over New Jersey.

28
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,680
They're all over the world.

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,080
There were several mystery drone flights over our nuclear testing range.

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,680
Just take a look at all of the military sites all over the world that these drones have visited.

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,960
This is the continuation of a story that's been unraveling since the dawn of the atomic age.

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,760
Based off of the information that you've been privy to,

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,560
is there any indication that these UAPs are interested in our nuclear technology and capabilities?

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,400
Yes.

35
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,720
By external observation, sure, that could be a fair assessment, yeah.

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,320
Yes.

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,280
After the detonation of the atomic bombs in Japan, that's when the UFO sightings ramped up.

38
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,040
When Oppenheimer detonated the world's first atom bomb at Trinity Test Site in 1945,

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,720
and later as Edward Teller's hydrogen bomb shook the South Pacific in 1952,

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,800
since then, UFOs have been systematically surveying and even tampering with our nuclear weapons,

41
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
stockpiles, and power plants.

42
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,680
All 10 missiles were off alert. All 10.

43
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,800
Whole flight was off alert. All red.

44
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,360
And I said, it looks like we got a UFO.

45
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,480
UFOs consistently appear at nuclear weapons facilities and energy grids around the world.

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,480
From Los Alamos, to Hanford, to Oak Ridge, to Malmstrom, to Minot, to F.E. Warren,

47
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:32,480
to Savannah Rivers site, to Royal Air Force bases in the UK, and nuclear sites in the former Soviet Union,

48
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:40,480
UFOs are seen hovering over silos, tampering with comms lengths, and even disabling nuclear missiles themselves.

49
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,480
They were not launchable. They were in a no-go condition.

50
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,480
And if you want to learn all about it, you're in luck,

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,480
because today's amazing American alchemist is Robert Hastings,

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,480
the man who has dedicated his life to documenting this unquestionable connection.

53
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,480
Jesse Michaels and his crew are here today and they're doing an interview with me,

54
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,480
so we're in the middle of that, so let me call you later today and we'll discuss this further.

55
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:13,480
His nearly 600-page book, UFOs and Nukes, is literally the world's best database on this phenomenon.

56
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,480
I view your book, UFOs and Nukes, as sort of the best possible database

57
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,480
when it comes to credible witnesses viewing UFOs.

58
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Hastings has personally interviewed 167 employees of nuclear bases across the United States,

59
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,480
many of whom are clear to the most sensitive American national security secrets.

60
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Holy mackerel, there's this white pulsating object.

61
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,480
That can't be one of ours.

62
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,480
These are missile technicians, ICBM security personnel, missileers, radar operators, and more,

63
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:55,480
who have all seen orbs, saucers, disks, and tic-tacs in and around the most sensitive nuclear airspace.

64
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,480
By nature of who they are, these witnesses are inherently some of the most reliable in the world.

65
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Some literally have their finger on the nuclear button.

66
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,480
You know, they're on what they call PRP.

67
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,480
They have to like report if they're like, you know, taking ibuprofen for God's sakes.

68
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,480
And these witnesses couldn't care less about fame or attention.

69
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,480
In fact, most of them want to avoid these things at all costs.

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,480
In fact, many of them have suffered intensely in their careers for speaking out about their experiences.

71
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,480
A flag was being put in their folders, citing them as a security risk,

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,480
so that if they sought employment with like an aerospace company or something,

73
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,480
the Air Force would have designated them to be security risks.

74
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,480
We will interview two of these witnesses with mind-blowing stories directly in this episode,

75
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
and you can be the judge.

76
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,480
One was threatened repeatedly, and his records were deleted from Vandenberg Air Force Base.

77
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
They threatened my wife.

78
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,480
You're going down, motherfucker, means to me we're going to kill you.

79
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,480
They denied there was ever a Robert Jacobs in the Air Force.

80
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,480
He gets a phone call one night. He and his wife come home from a movie.

81
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
The phone rings.

82
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,480
The voice says, your mailbox, a light, what a beautiful sight.

83
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
You're going down, motherfucker.

84
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,480
While the other boarded a craft at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota.

85
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,480
They were just multi-levels with all these small grays everywhere.

86
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Hastings has risked his life in telling stories like these.

87
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Do you feel like your communications are being tracked?

88
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
No question.

89
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,480
After each one of those calls, I would talk to them, hang up the phone.

90
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Within a minute or five or ten, the phone would ring.

91
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,480
I would pick it up, and there would be nothing but heavy breathing in the phone.

92
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:51,480
I originally met Robert because I had been going around making constant public references to his great book, UFOs and Nukes.

93
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Robert Hastings.

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
Robert Hastings.

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Robert Hastings.

96
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
She wrote UFOs and nukes.

97
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:04,480
So Robert emailed me because he wanted to let me know that while he had documented 100-plus UFO witnesses at nuclear sites across the U.S.,

98
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,480
I was personally overstating the amount of radar operators who he had spoken to.

99
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,480
If that doesn't say something about Robert's character and attention to detail, I don't know what does.

100
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,480
He comes from a bygone era of meticulousness and passion that journalists used to display,

101
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,480
and one that's easily palpable in this interview.

102
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Robert Hastings was 100% spot on before anybody else, and this is a man who deserves the recognition.

103
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:36,480
He is the giant that a lot of us have stood on his shoulders.

104
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:43,480
It does not contain any pattern of purpose or of consistency.

105
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,480
This documentary will answer the two biggest critiques thrown at UFOs by skeptics.

106
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Number one, UFOs are ephemeral.

107
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
They show up randomly and sporadically.

108
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,480
There's nothing repeatable or predictable about them.

109
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,480
The nuclear thing is a repeatable pattern.

110
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:06,480
Legacy UFO programs have used nuclear material or sometimes even phony nuclear material to bait UFOs to show up.

111
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,480
And number two, UFOs are some American deep state scion.

112
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Why do they only seem to show up at American military bases?

113
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,480
A huge disc shaped object was seen hovering over this missile base in Soviet Ukraine.

114
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:29,480
The Bentwaters case in 1980 in England, that was the largest group of tactical nuclear weapons being stored in Western Europe.

115
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:36,480
And it went back out into the field and then it exploded silently into objects, white objects, and disappeared.

116
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,480
UFOs are repeatably and scientifically attracted to nuclear sites.

117
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,480
You can kind of guess if there is a UFO sighting, there might be a nuclear connection there.

118
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Take the most famous archetypal sighting in American history, the crashed flying disc at Roswell in New Mexico in 1947.

119
00:07:53,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Well, Roswell was actually the site of the first atomic bomber squadron in America, the squadron responsible for dropping bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

120
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:15,480
In 1994, 62 elementary school kids at the aerial school in Zimbabwe said that they saw a silver craft descend from the sky and land on a field near the school.

121
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Well, guess where the aerial school was?

122
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,480
And you know an aerial school that was near a uranium mining site?

123
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
That is right, as far as I understand.

124
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:32,480
And what about that story that Vice ran in 2022 about a little town in Japan that's obsessed with UFOs?

125
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,480
It's a place called Eno, and it's actually right next to Fukushima's nuclear grid.

126
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:45,480
And after an earthquake famously triggered a nuclear power meltdown there in 2011, the chief monk of a local temple said,

127
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,480
The UFOs came after the explosion. There were so many of them. I was shocked.

128
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:58,480
Similarly, Harvard PhD Jensine Andreessen writes about UFO activity at the height of the Chernobyl disaster.

129
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:06,480
When many people in the area observed a UFO come, stay for three minutes, shine a light at the reactor, and depart.

130
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I could go on all day.

131
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,480
By the end of this documentary, the only question you'll be left with is why.

132
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Why are UFOs so interested in our nuclear technology?

133
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,480
It's no different than we go to the Serengeti and we watch the cheetahs preying upon the antelope, you know.

134
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,480
It's interesting to watch. What are their hunting techniques? What are their capabilities?

135
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,480
It might be as simple as like it's an attractant, like a fly or a mosquito to a blue light, right?

136
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,480
It's kind of like taking matches out of the hands of a baby.

137
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Whoa. Yeah, whoa, right?

138
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:46,480
So without further ado, meet the man who has risked his life documenting this unquestionable but infinitely bizarre connection,

139
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,480
a mysterious link that lies at the heart of the modern UFO question.

140
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,480
This week's American Alchemist, the legendary Robert Hastings.

141
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Did you know your personal information is being bought and sold online right now?

142
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Data brokers collect and sell your private details like your phone number, address, and even information about your relatives.

143
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,480
This makes it easier than ever for scammers, stalkers, and even strangers to access your data.

144
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,480
With the rise in online threats, protecting your privacy is no longer optional.

145
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,480
I use Delete Me to take control of my online privacy.

146
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,480
It's a hands-free subscription service that removes my personal information from hundreds of data broker sites.

147
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:35,480
I recently got my privacy report and seeing how many sites had my info and then watching that data disappear was absolutely incredible.

148
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,480
Delete Me's experts do all the work for you, monitoring and removing your data all year round.

149
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,480
It's not just about protecting yourself. When data brokers sell your information, they also expose details about your family.

150
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,480
That's why Delete Me offers a family plan to help you safeguard your loved ones too.

151
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,480

154
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:27,480
Declassified U.S. government documents and witness testimony from former or retired U.S. military personnel confirm beyond any doubt the reality of ongoing UFO incursions at nuclear weapons sites.

155
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:35,480
How does anybody get into the topic of UFOs showing up around nuclear sites?

156
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:44,480
My father was career Air Force and in 1967 he was stationed at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana.

157
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:54,480
I was a junior in high school at the time. He got me a job at the air traffic control tower on the base as a janitor.

158
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,480
At one point I made the acquaintance of an FAA supervisor named Bob Grasser.

159
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:09,480
One night, and as best as I can tell it was the second half of March of 67, was emptying trash cans and pushing a broom.

160
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,480
And he motioned me over to his scope.

161
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:23,480
And he pointed, he said, we're tracking, and he probably said unknowns. That's the formal term for unidentified objects.

162
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:31,480
I saw five blips in the sort of northeast quadrant of his radar scope.

163
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,480
As I recall it after all these years, I got kind of excited by this and started peppering him with questions.

164
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,480
And his whole demeanor kind of went, uh oh, you know, I've said too much.

165
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Nevertheless, I went home and told my dad, you know, you're not going to believe what happened tonight at the tower.

166
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,480
He said the guys that I'm talking to down there think they're probably Soviet surveillance planes.

167
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:01,480
And even though I was 16, I went five surveillance planes, you know, and the controller told me they were basically stationary.

168
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,480
You know, are the Soviets flying helicopters over Montana? I don't think so.

169
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:16,480
When his stint as a janitor at Malmstrom was over, Robert went to college, got married, and began working as a photographer.

170
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,480
But that gnawing urge to understand what he had witnessed never left him.

171
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:32,480
In 1973, while brushing up on UFOs, he stumbled upon an article that famed astronomer J. Alan Hynek had written in 1966 while running Project Blue Book,

172
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,480
the official government UFO investigations program out of the Air Force.

173
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,480
The article said that UFOs had flown around nuclear missiles at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota.

174
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,480
And I went, holy crap, you know, that had to be what was happening at Malmstrom.

175
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,480
So I was off and running at that point and slowly but surely during the early 70s onward,

176
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,480
I just began seeking out military veterans who might have information they could share.

177
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,480
When we got down there, they told us that this bogey was out there right over the campus ordinance works

178
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,480
and directed Lieutenant Commander Brown to take off and challenge him.

179
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Thanks to Robert's efforts, we now know that UFO overflights of nuclear bases were happening as early as 1945 in the United States.

180
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,480
Months before the Trinity test in New Mexico, months before the atomic bombings in Japan,

181
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,480
Bud Clem was describing luminous balls of light hovering over the Hanford plutonium protection site,

182
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,480
being chased away unsuccessfully by jet fighters on three occasions.

183
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,480
He said, all I can see is a bright red or reddish orange fireball right up in front of me.

184
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:57,480
When the Roswell object crashed, which Lou Elizondo in his new book has said was indeed a bona fide UFO crash in July of 47,

185
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,480
that base was the only, the only nuclear bomber base in the world at the time.

186
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,480
In 1948, a renowned expert in meteorites at the University of New Mexico named Lincoln La Paz

187
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,480
began studying green fireballs, often in correlation with nuclear facilities and detonations.

188
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,480
He concluded that given the fireballs' flight patterns,

189
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,480
that they were artificially controlled by a nuclear bomb.

190
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Dan Wilson spent, I don't know how many hours tracking down green fireball sightings

191
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,480
that were coinciding with radiation drifting across the American landscape.

192
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,480
Dozens and dozens of instances where within hours of a certain time,

193
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
a fireball would have hit the ground,

194
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
and then the fireball would have hit the ground,

195
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
and then the fireball would have hit the ground,

196
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
and then the fireball would have hit the ground,

197
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Dozens and dozens of instances where within hours of a certain test occurring

198
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,480
and the subsequent radiation drifting across this part of America or that part of America,

199
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,480
those geographic locations had green fireball sightings.

200
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,480
When they exploded, unlike a normal meteor, there was no noise, there was no debris found.

201
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,480
It didn't continue after 1948, so the question is still open.

202
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,480
And what about the famous DC flyover in 1952?

203
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,480
In Washington, ghost-like objects dart across the radar screen

204
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,480
at the CAA Traffic Control Center at National Airport for several hours,

205
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
traveling more than 100 miles an hour.

206
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,480
This was a very famous incident where saucers were seen everywhere

207
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,480
in and around Washington, D.C., causing headlines like

208
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Saucers on the White House Lawn

209
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,480
and an emergency phone call between President Truman

210
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,480
and Blue Book Chief Investigator Edward J. Ruppelt.

211
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,480
But what did any of this have to do with nuclear?

212
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
What happened in 1952?

213
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,480
The DC UFO sightings in July.

214
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Yeah, I was going to say the...

215
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
Well, what else?

216
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,480
The first H-bomb.

217
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,480
The H-bomb. Teller, yeah.

218
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,480
The concern that I have is that in 1952,

219
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,480
what if there was someone there to hear what we said in the Pacific?

220
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,480
We sent off a signal, just the way when North Korea detonates a nuclear device,

221
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,480
it sends seismic waves through the Earth.

222
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Can't stop sending information outside of the country.

223
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,480
I think in 1952, we sent a signal to the cosmos,

224
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,480
which is that we're very, very close to being in possession

225
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,480
of root-level knowledge to take a software metaphor.

226
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,480
If there was something or someone there to hear us,

227
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,480
they probably heard us as saying we're on the verge of being able to come visit.

228
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
That's terrifying.

229
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,480
But the DC flyover occurred in July of 1952,

230
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,480
and the first hydrogen bombs were tested later that year, in November.

231
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,480
So the timing is a bit off if Weinstein is attempting to draw an exact correlation.

232
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,480
But what's not as well known is that at the time,

233
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,480
a state-of-the-art plutonium and tritium production facility

234
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,480
was being built at Savannah River site in South Carolina.

235
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,480
In July of 1952, it had just become operational,

236
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,480
and it was the most secretive atomic site in the United States.

237
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,480
In fact, a young nuclear engineer stationed there named John Anderson

238
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,480
was required to attend a group event with a hundred other engineers on site

239
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,480
to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of DuPont Company in 1802.

240
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,480
Kind of weird, but hey, I guess that's what you celebrate while working on a nuclear site.

241
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Anderson and his colleagues were quickly overtaken by a green glowing object,

242
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,480
angular in size, darting back and forth erratically at high speeds and altitudes

243
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
with phenomenal maneuverability.

244
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,480
We now know that the date of this event was likely July 19, 1952,

245
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,480
the peak day of sightings for the 1952 DC flyover.

246
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,480
Were the UFOs perhaps trying to send a message to our federal government?

247
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,480
And what was being detected by the best American telescopes at the time?

248
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Well, I've spoken to an amazing Swedish astronomer named Beatrice Villarreal about just that.

249
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,480
So we were comparing these images from the early 50s to images as it looks today,

250
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,480
and I was hoping to see this perfect sparkling star

251
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,480
that you can find in multiple images that one day vanishes.

252
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,480
And I had this image where you could see multiple stars

253
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,480
appearing and vanishing, which is completely crazy.

254
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,480
I got an idea of that one of the ways how one can also search for more such examples

255
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,480
by looking for those that are lying along a line or in a narrow band.

256
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,480
And we had two such examples that were statistically significant.

257
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,480
One is five objects on a narrow band, and it's from the 27th of July, 1952.

258
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,480
And then my colleague Enrique found these three stars, the triple transients.

259
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,480
This one is from the 19th of July, 1952.

260
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
That's absolutely amazing.

261
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,480
I mean, because in UFO lore, this Washington invasion or DC flyover

262
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,480
where there were saucers all over DC at the time, and it was specifically July of 1952,

263
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
but it was specifically two weekends.

264
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,480
It was the 19th and 20th, and it was the 26th and 27th.

265
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,480
So I find that absolutely remarkable.

266
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,480
But Eric Weinstein may have still been right in another sense.

267
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,480
There is actually a direct link between the hydrogen bomb blasts at the Marshall Islands and UFOs.

268
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,480
The famous tests codenamed Operation Ivy and Operation Castle.

269
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:18,480
There was another major one called Project Castle or Operation Castle in the spring of 54.

270
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,480
And I found sailors who were aboard various vessels who were describing very brief,

271
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,480
but clearly sightings of disk-shaped objects or spherical-shaped objects hovering over their ships.

272
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,480
In fact, the entry from the deck log of the USS Curtis,

273
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,480
the ship that detonated the hydrogen bomb at Bikini Atoll, reads,

274
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,480
At 23.05, an unidentified luminous object passed over ship from bow to stern,

275
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,480
yellowish-orange in color, traveling at a high rate of speed in a low altitude.

276
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,480
I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita.

277
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,480
Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.

278
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:15,480
The connection between UFOs and nuclear was known since the beginning of American government atomic programs.

279
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,480
We now know, due to verified declassified documents, that on May 5, 1949,

280
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,480
after multiple sightings at Killian Base at Camp Hood, Texas,

281
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,480
which stored America's largest nuclear stockpile to date, that an emergency meeting was held.

282
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,480
The meeting included the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations,

283
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,480
the Office of Naval Intelligence, Army Counterintelligence, and the FBI.

284
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,480
They were called in to discuss the sudden ubiquitous appearance of UFOs across nuclear bases in the U.S.

285
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,480
Also that year, a now-public FBI memo was sent to Director J. Edgar Hoover,

286
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,480
reporting flying disks, flying saucers, and balls of fire,

287
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,480
quote-unquote, considered top secret by intelligence officers of both the Army and Air Force.

288
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,480
The memo goes on to discuss frequent sightings at Los Alamos, the headquarters of the Manhattan Project.

289
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,480
There's some people I'm colleagues with that, like, their grandparents were actually, you know,

290
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,480
the UFO report people on the Manhattan Project, and I remember being told that.

291
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
I was like, really? Holy crap, that's crazy.

292
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
There's like a whole other side of the Manhattan Project.

293
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,480
The connection between UFOs and nuclear was known since the beginning of American government atomic programs,

294
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,480
and UFOs are classified with the same protocols governing American atomic secrets.

295
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,480
If something is not a nuke, but it has radiological energy coming off it, you know, alpha, beta decay, whatever.

296
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Same secrecy.

297
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Same secrecy.

298
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,480
In a 1952 Look magazine article titled The Hunt for the Flying Saucer,

299
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,480
chief UFO investigator for the Air Force, Captain Edward J. Ruppelt has quoted saying,

300
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:16,480
many of the sightings reported had originated at one atomic weapons-related site or another all around the country.

301
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:26,480
And Ruppelt is on record in the article saying that we are aware of 63 separate incidents of UFOs being sighted at nuclear weapons facilities.

302
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,480
In fact, the rumors of UFOs at Los Alamos and other nuclear sites were so widespread

303
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,480
that Eleanor Roosevelt wrote to Oppenheimer inquiring about them.

304
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Responding with a letter that's been fully verified and archived in the Library of Congress,

305
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Oppenheimer wrote back reassuring the former First Lady that these were just rumors.

306
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,480
But from a 1971 Australian intelligence document written by the head of their nuclear division, Harry Turner,

307
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,480
Oppenheimer was deeply involved in exotic anti-gravity research.

308
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
So was Oppenheimer playing dumb?

309
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Would Oppenheimer have been told?

310
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,480
The Manhattan Project would have custody of it, and then it would go into the Atomic Energy Commission,

311
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,480
and then it would go into the Department of Energy, which has its own line of clearances.

312
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,480
And that's why I can't find among the people I know who have clearances above top secret.

313
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,480
They've never heard of this.

314
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,480
They've never heard of this because you can be in the Pentagon with the top secret clearance.

315
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,480
But if you're not briefed on the atomic secrets, you wouldn't get the clearance.

316
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:44,480
If you're not briefed on the atomic secrets, you wouldn't get the clearances that you needed to do to open up that thing.

317
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,480
Fast forward to 1964. We're on Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

318
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:06,480
A classified program is taking place called Atlas, testing dummy nuclear warheads being launched from intercontinental ballistic missiles.

319
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:16,480
A photo instrumentation specialist, Lt. Bob Jacobs, was tasked with capturing the launch of two missiles from 100 miles north of Vandenberg at Big Sur.

320
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:29,480
A giant 18-wheel truck came tracking up this Forest Service Road and brought this enormous Canada object telescope with a focal length of about 2,000 inches.

321
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:37,480
The normal length on a 35-millimeter camera is 2 inches, so you can imagine how big the image would be in a 2,000-inch lens.

322
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
So I said, wow, this is neat.

323
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,480
The guy who had built this thing was named Dr. Walt Manning at Boston University.

324
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Anyway, we got the telescope all set up and we were ready to go.

325
00:26:50,480 --> 00:27:01,480
Major management called and he said, tomorrow morning at 0600, get ready because we're launching an Atlas missile and we want you to photograph that with the big BU telescope.

326
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:10,480
I went, OK. So at 0600, we were up and ready to go and an Atlas missile popped up through the ground fog that was covering the whole coastline all the way down there. It was beautiful.

327
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:25,480
We took the film back to Vandenberg, where it was processed, and a day later I got a call from Major Mansman, who said, come up to my office.

328
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:38,480
So I went to his office and he said there was a movie screen set up and a 16-millimeter projector, and there was Major Mansman and, as I recall, two guys in gray suits.

329
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
On the screen was the film we had shot.

330
00:27:46,480 --> 00:28:00,480
We could see clearly on film, the nose cones separate, and then we saw the dummy warhead, and suddenly into that frame, an object flew in chasing the warhead and so on at the same speed.

331
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:08,480
It's going between six and eight thousand miles an hour at that point, and it fired a beam of light at the dummy warhead.

332
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:28,480
The object flew up like this, shot another beam of light at the dummy warhead, went around like this, shot another beam of light at it, went down like this, shot a beam of light like this, and then flew out the same way to come in, at which time the dummy warhead did this and fell out of the frame.

333
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Florence Mansman analyzed the film frame by frame with a magnifier, what's called a loop magnifier, and he's on record by the mid-80s.

334
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:57,480
He was writing to Jacobs in private letters saying, what I saw with the magnifier was a disc-shaped object with a dome, and before each of the four flashes of light were observed, the whole disc pivoted, flashed the light, pivoted back, and then pivoted again for the next flash.

335
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:06,480
The lights came on, and Major Mansman said to me, were you guys screwing around up there?

336
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,480
And I said, no sir, and he said, what was that?

337
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:21,480
And I said, it looks like we got a UFO, and he said, Lieutenant Jacobs, you are never to speak of this again, it never happened.

338
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,480
The two guys in the gray suits stood behind him looking at me, and he said, do I make myself clear?

339
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,480
I said, yes sir, what else are you going to say to the Major in charge here?

340
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,480
So who were these mysterious men in suits?

341
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Mansman said they were CIA, and they confiscated the film, not a higher Air Force office, CIA confiscated the film.

342
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Didn't they delete your records from the government as well?

343
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,480
People denied that you worked at Vandenberg, is that right?

344
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,480
They denied there was ever a Robert Jacobs in the Air Force.

345
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,480
In another inquiry, they denied there was ever a Robert Jacobs at Vandenberg Air Force base.

346
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:13,480
They denied there was ever anybody named Robert Jacobs in charge of the 1369th Photographic Union Division that I ran.

347
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,480
And you managed over 100 people, so it's pretty easy for you to corroborate.

348
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:28,480
Yeah, I had 134 guys working for me, and I had two friends from college who were my commanding people, and I also have something called a DD-14.

349
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:37,480
I have records here, my officer efficiency reports are in there, I can't get rid of stuff.

350
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,480
My wife keeps saying, clear that shit out of your bottle of vodka over there, Bob.

351
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,480
I go, no, I might use it, and sure enough, it's turned out to be valuable in defending myself against the infamy of the CIA.

352
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,480
But we didn't have a launch on that date, there was no Atlas launch that day.

353
00:30:52,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Well, it got damn well there was, because Robert found the files from Vandenberg using that particular launch in detail.

354
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,480
So they also scrubbed the launch itself from the records?

355
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Correct, never happened.

356
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,480
And your mailbox was blown up as well, right?

357
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:19,480
My wife and I had been out to a movie, we came back from the movie about 10 o'clock at night, and there was a message on my answering machine.

358
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:31,480
And it said, fireworks in your mailbox at night, oh what a beautiful sight, you're going down motherfucker, and my mailbox blew up.

359
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,480
I lived on a farm, I had a rural mailbox, and suddenly there was an explosion in my mailbox block.

360
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,480
I took that quite seriously, I bought an ammunition for my gun.

361
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Well, we now basically know that in 1952, the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence took the real UFO investigations underground.

362
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:06,480
They did this while performing a psychological operation on the American population in the form of Air Force's Project Blue Book, which was explicitly meant to downplay and explain away UFOs.

363
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:14,480
Project Blue Book was the best they could do at the time, because they felt they had a real project going on that was secret.

364
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Is that true?

365
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,480
And the Air Force did.

366
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Oh, I didn't know that.

367
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,480
So really, it was the CIA and the Atomic Energy Commission responsible for the real, deeper research on UFOs.

368
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,480
The FBI and the Air Force's Project Blue Book were kept in the dark.

369
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,480
This clip from the great James Fox movie, Out of the Blue, is perhaps telling.

370
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Edgar Hoover wrote several letters stating that the investigation of unidentified flying objects is not and never has been within the jurisdiction of the FBI.

371
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Here's just another example of joint CIA atomic energy research going on around UFOs at the time.

372
00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:02,480
At the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis, on the 25th of October in 1962, a nuclear test called Bluegill Triple Prime was executed.

373
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:10,480
It involved a sub-megaton X-1 nuclear warhead launched minutes before midnight at Johnston Atoll in the South Pacific.

374
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,480
According to many on the ship witnessing the test, a bright, fiery object tumbled out from the plume of the blast.

375
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,480
There is apparently video evidence of this.

376
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:31,480
In fact, an Australian intelligence officer who's dealt with sensitive nuclear assets named Jeff Kershane says that this video was later sanitized and censored to cover up the UFO.

377
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:38,480
He says that a white triangle was later superimposed on the video where the object tumbles out of the plume.

378
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,480
Only a few milliseconds after the detonation, the fireball is approximately a kilometre wide.

379
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:52,480
A bright, fiery object tumbles out from within the nuclear fireball and it's plain as day.

380
00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:01,480
You can slow it down and see this very bright object that must be at least 50 to 100 metres long tumble out from within the nuclear fireball.

381
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:06,480
You believe that that is some kind of craft?

382
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Just like the one that was following the Atlas 8F test, but this time it was a real warhead.

383
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Kershane also maintains that the recovery effort was documented in the original ship's deck logs and that a spherical debris with some very interesting properties was found.

384
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:35,480
These tests were overseen by the Albuquerque Operations Office, whose Atomic Energy Commission Director was none other than Lawrence Guise, who happens to be Jeff Bezos' maternal grandfather.

385
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,480
But Jeff Kershane is just one source and he's in Australia.

386
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:51,480
Harold Malmgren, a direct advisor to four American presidents, including JFK, is a man whose credentials are beyond reproach.

387
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,480
And just look at what he tweeted.

388
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:13,480
So it sounds like JFK might have gotten into UFOs in November of 1962.

389
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:20,480
All of this might explain this letter of admittedly controversial provenance that was supposedly foiled in 2005.

390
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:27,480
It's from JFK, but it's dated November 12th, 1963, just 10 days before his death.

391
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:38,480
In the letter, the president is asking the CIA director, John McCone, for all data on unknowns so the Americans could coordinate better with the Soviets on detente.

392
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,480
And so the Soviets wouldn't mistake UFOs for acts of American aggression.

393
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:51,480
All of this would also explain some very interesting recent statements made by Trump's FBI appointee, Cash Patel, about the JFK file.

394
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,480
You're talking to a guy that's read the entire JFK file.

395
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,480
The things that we can't release have nothing to do with the questions you guys are asking.

396
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,480
The answers you guys want pretty much have them.

397
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:15,480
There is very minimal stuff that can't be seen from things that you wouldn't even think are related to.

398
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:22,480
I want to be clear. We don't have enough clarity on the origins of this letter to know that it's conclusively real.

399
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,480
It was supposedly foiled by a guy in 2005.

400
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:32,480
So I don't know if it's real, but it fully comports with Malmgren's story that JFK visited Los Alamos in 62.

401
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,480
It also makes sense in the context of JFK's detente efforts with Russia.

402
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:43,480
John Greenwald has done some good work investigating this document and has found some anomalies in it.

403
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:51,480
If any other researchers can either prove it to be a forgery or real, that would be extremely helpful and revelatory.

404
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
So have at it. But I digress.

405
00:36:53,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Let's move away from speculation and get back to the abundance of overwhelming hard facts around the widespread UFO nuclear link.

406
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:16,480
Do you have conviction that the video that you watched was not altered in any way?

407
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,480
And what is the source of that conviction if you do?

408
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480
Do you know Luis Elizondo?

409
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,480
I do. Yeah.

410
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:29,480
He verified. When he was in charge of ATIP, he saw my film, my account.

411
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,480
It's been transferred to DVD at that point, but he saw it and he said that's exactly what I saw.

412
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,480
We saw the video at ATIP.

413
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,480
That's crazy because that's what I was going to ask you.

414
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,480
He said he was like, I think Lou has seen the video.

415
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,480
So you've seen the video. Yeah.

416
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
So you know this is a real thing. Yeah.

417
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,480
Oh, my God. It is the video.

418
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Do you still have the video or I don't have it was in Pentagon with all my other files when when the Pentagon said they deleted everything.

419
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,480
Of course, we know they really didn't because really after they.

420
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,480
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.

421
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,480
Where everything is. And then and then when I talked to a buddy of mine, apparently somebody went in and they they cleaned everything out.

422
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,480
But what they don't realize is that there's backups in a whole lot of places at that.

423
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Oh, OK.

424
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,480
The problem is, if I say it right now, they'll go into mysteriously a bunch of people's computers will wind up disappearing tomorrow.

425
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,480
So I'm just going to wait until the right time.

426
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,480
And, you know, that stuff is alive and well.

427
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:33,480
I just wanted to put enough out there, touch on all the most sensitive parts, but I don't want to overly disclose because it's not my job.

428
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,480
Someone told me that Dave Grush was aware of the film.

429
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:46,480
And when he was on the task force, he had a colleague check a military archive to see if they could find any confirmation of the Big Sur incident.

430
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:54,480
According to Dave, this person did indeed find radar data confirming that an anomalous aerial object paced the warhead.

431
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,480
I think that's about all I can say publicly at this point.

432
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,480
There is evidence that someone or more accurately, something has tampered with our nuclear capability.

433
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:10,480
Bob Jacobs incident at Big Sur was just one example of a UFO directly interfering with military technology.

434
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:18,480
Just a few years later, hundreds of miles away at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, another unsettling event would take place.

435
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,480
This time affecting an entire row of intercontinental ballistic missiles.

436
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,480
Good afternoon. My name is Robert Salas.

437
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:36,480
In 1967, I was a First Lieutenant stationed at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana.

438
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Good afternoon. My name is Robert Salas.

439
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:45,480
In 1967, I was a First Lieutenant stationed at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana.

440
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:57,480
Sometime in the evening hours on March 24th, I received a call from one of my top side guards, the flight security controller,

441
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,480
stating that they had been observing strange lights in the sky making odd maneuvers.

442
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,480
He called back about five minutes later.

443
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:19,480
This time he was screaming into the phone saying they're looking at an object, a red glowing object, hovering just above our front gate.

444
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:30,480
I went to wake my commander, Fred Mywold, who was taking a rest break, started to tell him about the phone call.

445
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:38,480
And just as I told him, our missiles began going into what's called a no-go condition or unlaunchable.

446
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Essentially, they were disabled.

447
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,480
The missiles started shutting down or going off alert.

448
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,480
The only thing I could think was, oh my God.

449
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,480
Bob Jamison, you were there too, right?

450
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
Yes, sir.

451
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,480
And you were in the Air Force?

452
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Yes, I was in the Air Force.

453
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
What happened to you when this was happening?

454
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,480
I was a targeting officer, a missile targeting officer.

455
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,480
I was at home relaxing and I got a call from Job Control to tell them to come in.

456
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,480
And sure enough, on Job Control, they have a wall and they have green lights where all the missiles are on alert.

457
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,480
Except for one corner, all ten missiles were off alert, all ten.

458
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,480
The whole flight was off alert, all red.

459
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Is it possible they just malfunctioned?

460
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
That doesn't happen.

461
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:33,480
Very rarely does a missile malfunction, and I don't think any much more rare would be two at the same time, but never ten.

462
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:40,480
And they told me, yes, it was a sheriff in Roy, Montana, reported a UFO at the same time all the missiles went off alert.

463
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:51,480
The same person that told me all ten missiles went off alert also told me that there was a UFO that went down into a canyon near a little town not far from Obstrom called Belle, Montana.

464
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,480
There was a canyon there and there was a UFO trapped in the canyon.

465
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,480
The canyon is too steep to send men down in the night.

466
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,480
This is at night time.

467
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,480
The walls are too steep to send men down at night or even a helicopter down through there.

468
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:11,480
So they're going to take, as soon as daylight comes, they're going to take some helicopters and go down in there.

469
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:20,480
And I found out later, yeah, as soon as daylight came, they sent the helicopters and this UFO just went right through the helicopters and out, between the helicopters and out.

470
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:32,480
Skeptics have said that what you experienced and what Bob Salus have reported really amounted to some sort of Air Force drill, readiness drill.

471
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
How would you respond to that?

472
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,480
OK, I've heard of that, but I'll tell you right now.

473
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:47,480
The Pentagon, the military will not shut down ten strategic missiles just to hold a frigid test.

474
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480
It's not worth it.

475
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,480
If we hold down, we only have, we had a thousand missiles at the time.

476
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:04,480
If you take Ken down, you destroy a little bit of our national security and the Pentagon, the Air Force, SAC would not do that.

477
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,480
And they never have done that.

478
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,480
I've already mentioned my awareness of a radar tracking at Malmstrom in the spring of 67.

479
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:22,480
Based on my knowledge of the time frame when I was at the tower and the events that I witnessed on the radar screen where I was shown these five objects,

480
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:31,480
the time of day that occurred in the evening, it's conceivable that I witnessed what Bob was dealing with out at the missile site.

481
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:38,480
Who makes the encryption for these sort of systems? Is that the NSA?

482
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,480
It's an Air Force system, so I'm assuming that all the coding and all the technical aspects are controlled by the Air Force.

483
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,480
Boeing is the main missile contractor.

484
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:56,480
I know, in fact, there's a guy named Arnie Arneson, who is a former Air Force officer.

485
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:07,480
And he, in the course of giving this testimony publicly, has said one of his jobs was to take the encrypted missile launch codes to the various missile sites.

486
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,480
So it's an Air Force operation.

487
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:19,480
Malmstrom, like many of the sites mentioned here, have experienced repeated UFO encounters.

488
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:29,480
In fact, in January of 1993, combat targeting team member John Mills recalls driving with a six-person crew back to Malmstrom base where he was stationed

489
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,480
and seeing a bright object zigzagging around the sky.

490
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:42,480
When the crew got back to command, everybody at the vehicle equipment control branch was saying that there had been anomalies all over the base that day.

491
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,480
It was an open secret that the site was covered in UFOs.

492
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,480
We now go to Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota in 1966.

493
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:02,480
Historically, these UFOs seemed to toy with American nuclear sites, turning them off at will.

494
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,480
But in this specific case, and especially jarring one, nuclear missiles were actually activated.

495
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:18,480
Retired U.S. Air Force Captain David Schindel remembers starting his shift and hearing reports about a bright red glowing object hovering over the base.

496
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:27,480
When I came through the door, I was met by the site manager, a tech sergeant, and he put his hands out like this and he says,

497
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:35,480
that object out there had flashing lights. He sort of indicated how big that object was by putting his hands out like that.

498
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:43,480
I estimated maybe it was 80, 100 feet wide, I don't know, and probably about 100 feet away from the facility.

499
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:50,480
The object flew over Alpha Flight to Oscar Flight, giving erratic indications to the launch sites as it went.

500
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:57,480
Robert Hastings did a phone interview with Captain David Schirr, who actually received a launch indicator at his command post.

501
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,480
And as soon as you get that, of course, you've got to hit what you call a hivot switch that stops it.

502
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,480
Now, what does that mean that actually a launch sequence has been triggered?

503
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:15,480
That means that the missile has received a launch signal.

504
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,480
David Schirr flipped his inhibit switch, which only paused the launch countdown.

505
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,480
He still had to wait for a second inhibit switch to completely stop the sequence.

506
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:34,480
If just the one comes in, it sits there for a certain amount of time, and then it'll launch automatically at the end of that expired time.

507
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,480
So if that second one didn't come in, then that one missile would launch?

508
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,480
Theoretically.

509
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,480
Theoretically. Had that ever happened before or after, during your experience?

510
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,480
No.

511
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,480
Never.

512
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:56,480
You know, he's horrified, of course. He and the other officer down in the capsule, they're freaking out.

513
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,480
You know, this could be World War III if these missiles get off the ground.

514
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,480
Had to very quickly shut down, flipping this inhibit switch.

515
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,480
Are these entities in the UFOs, are they trying to start World War III?

516
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,480
And my response is no.

517
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,480
In my opinion, what they're attempting to do is to scare the hell out of the missile forces,

518
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,480
to show that they have the ability to interfere with the systems that they can activate the missiles.

519
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,480
We as a crew were never to speak about this again.

520
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,480
And we were told that it's actually, it never happened.

521
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,480
Those were the words that were used.

522
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,480
During the same time period, similar incidents were occurring at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota.

523
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,480
Ellsworth, like many missile sites, has an outer zone and an inner zone.

524
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,480
An outer zone alert can happen frequently, a cow rubbing against a fence, a flock of birds.

525
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:04,480
But an inner zone alert, or an IZ alert, is very serious because it means something is directly above the missile capsule.

526
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,480
I was on duty at Echo, which is our squadron command post, and we had an OZN and an IZN call it.

527
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:19,480
The strike crew was upstairs, three to five miles away, and they jumped in their trucks and went roaring out there.

528
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:25,480
And called me back and said, sir, for lack of a better description, there's a flying saucer hovering over that missile,

529
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,480
and there's a beam of reddish light going down to it.

530
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:43,480
Over the next few weeks, suddenly we had an influx of black, Huey helicopters, completely unmarked.

531
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:49,480
I walked up to one of them, there was one, and they had to have a file somewhere written on there, but you couldn't find a tail number.

532
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:57,480
And these crews in dark clothes, young, sharp men, obviously ex-military, I would guess NSA, I don't know, I never knew.

533
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,480
But then they left, and when everything slowed down, they disappeared, and we never got any feedback from the results.

534
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,480
To this day, I'd love to know what they captured during that time.

535
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:14,480
Because they were constant. This went on constantly at this time for about three months.

536
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,480
These sightings weren't limited to nuclear bases in the United States.

537
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,480
Take the Bentwaters Rendlesham Forest incident in England.

538
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,480
That was the largest group of tactical nuclear weapons being stored in Western Europe.

539
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,480
And they were really cagey about that for a long time after the case.

540
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:42,480
The official policy to this day, is my understanding, is that the Air Force will neither confirm or deny the exact location of stored nuclear weapons.

541
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,480
Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt detailed the entire incident in a memo to the UK Ministry of Defense.

542
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,480
He said that a security patrol saw strange lights descending into the nearby Rendlesham Forest.

543
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,480
A group of servicemen entered the forest to investigate.

544
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,480
One of the witnesses was a US Air Force sergeant named Jim Penniston.

545
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:23,480
Not only do you have multiple witnesses, but you also have one of the witnesses claiming to have been taken on board a craft and speaking to these alien beings.

546
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:30,480
You're talking about Burroughs and Penniston, these two security policemen who saw this triangular-shaped craft in the woods.

547
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:42,480
Penniston says he approached a triangular black metallic craft that was approximately the size of a pickup truck and was emitting bright lights and a strange energy.

548
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:52,480
He stated that he touched the surface of the craft, noting smooth, glass-like material and unusual symbols etched on its side that resembled hieroglyphs.

549
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:59,480
According to Penniston, he experienced a profound telepathic download of binary code after touching the craft.

550
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:07,480
He then transcribed this binary code into a notebook, which was reportedly decoded years later to reveal cryptic messages.

551
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,480
I have not focused on that. Everyone knows the case. They've given multiple interviews and so on.

552
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:30,480
But what I did from the outset was I knew that what's called a WSA, a weapon storage area, was at the Bentwaters, RAF Bentwaters base,

553
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:40,480
and that there were reports that surfaced of one of the aerial objects hovering above the WSA and sending beams of light down into it.

554
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:48,480
Now, Colonel Halt, when I interviewed him back in 2005, said he was out in the woods with his team.

555
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,480
Everybody, probably a lot of people, have seen these accounts where he's in the woods. He's got his tape recorder.

556
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:04,480
They see this object that looks like an eyeball moving through the woods, and then they see objects in the sky, one of which hovers over he and his team of security policemen,

557
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:13,480
and then it fires down a beam of light at their feet, and they jump back and they go, you know, are we being attacked? Is this a warning? What's going on here?

558
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:23,480
Well, he was several miles, he said a couple of miles from the weapon storage area, but he heard on the radio that he had that security policeman back at the weapon storage area

559
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,480
reporting an object hovering above the weapon storage area, sending down beams of light.

560
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:41,480
I tried to find and interview one of the security policemen who actually saw the beams coming down. I was unsuccessful in that regard.

561
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:52,480
What I did succeed in getting were a couple of guys on the record saying that there was an object that was a multicolored disk quite near them, quite large,

562
00:52:53,480 --> 00:53:06,480
and one of them said that when it was brought to his attention he turned around, he saw something that looked like a rod or an antenna from the bottom of the craft retracting into the craft,

563
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:21,480
and what I surmise is that antenna or rod probably released the beam when his back was turned, and by the time he had returned the beam was gone and the rod was retracting into the craft.

564
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:30,480
What I did independently succeed in doing was interviewing a retired colonel who was involved with NATO weapons security.

565
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:41,480
He has not given me permission to use his name, but I know his background, his credentials, and what he said was when he was with NATO weapons security,

566
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:58,480
he was aware that shortly after this incident two tactical nuclear bombs were removed from a bunker at Bentwaters, flown aboard a C-5A aircraft to Kirtland Air Force Base where there's a weapons lab, Air Force weapons lab,

567
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:09,480
and that those weapons were analyzed presumably to see whether any of the beams had impacted them in any manner, compromised their functionality or whatever, I'm presuming.

568
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:21,480
I never had a feeling of it being extraterrestrial. It's always been that they were simply us in the future.

569
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,480
And Jim Pennison's career took sort of a hit after this too, is that right?

570
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:36,480
Jim Pennison and I believe Burroughs too, but certainly Jim Pennison said that he was subjected to like sodium pentothal, some kind of drug was administered to him.

571
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,480
He was questioned.

572
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,480
Sodium pentothal, that's like an MKL truth thing.

573
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,480
It's commonly known as truth serum, yeah.

574
00:54:45,480 --> 00:55:03,480
And if I'm not mistaken, Pennison is on record as saying he was administered something that was clearly designed to affect his mental state while he was being interrogated so he couldn't fabricate or potentially not tell the truth,

575
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,480
is the inference of what I've read of him saying publicly.

576
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:14,480
But he said that there were British intelligence and Air Force intelligence in the room when this was being conducted on him.

577
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:22,480
One of the other witnesses, John Burroughs, a U.S. Air Force Airman, also experienced physical and psychological effects.

578
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:32,480
And Burroughs had some lingering effects around his brain, possibly the dorsal strait and the caudate and pertainment of his brain, is that right?

579
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,480
There was some scarring there?

580
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:40,480
And his heart, I mean he's had heart issues so I don't know the details, but yeah, he had physical effects, certainly.

581
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,480
Basically that would be a result of high electromagnetic radiation.

582
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,480
Conceivably, yes.

583
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:56,480
Then there's a very alarming account in 1982 in the Soviet Ukraine.

584
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:07,480
George Knapp, a well-known journalist who has broken many UFO-related stories over the years.

585
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:17,480
I believe in 1994 he went to Russia, which would have been about three years after the Soviet Union collapsed, which was December of 1991.

586
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:25,480
And he interviewed scores of former Soviet military personnel about UFO activity during the Soviet era.

587
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:40,480
One of the people that he interviewed was a retired Soviet Army Colonel named Vladimir Plantinov, who actually provided, unbelievably provided Knapp with a series of still classified Soviet documents about UFO activity.

588
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:51,480
And actually allowed George to take him with him in a suitcase, in essence smuggling him back to the United States, still classified documents.

589
00:56:51,480 --> 00:57:03,480
And one of them described an incident in Soviet Ukraine where a huge disc-shaped object, a very large object, was seen hovering over this missile base in Soviet Ukraine.

590
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:09,480
And down in one of the launch capsules, suddenly the missiles went into countdown mode.

591
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:25,480
And apparently, according to this document that George Knapp brought to the West, for 15 seconds these missiles were preparing to launch, which had they indeed been launched at what could have been World War III.

592
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:32,480
You'll recall in the Minot case, the missiles had to be deactivated manually by their human operators.

593
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,480
But here they were mysteriously deactivated without any human intervention.

594
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:46,480
So was this just a display of technological superiority, or was it an experiment to observe how humans respond to such scenarios?

595
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,480
Okay, but these are all historical cases. Is any of this going on today?

596
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,480
I'm aware of cases that have occurred at missile sites as recently as 2015.

597
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:09,480
Less than an hour, about an hour on Saturday, the base lost primary communication with about 50 intercontinental ballistic missiles.

598
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:20,480
In 2010, at F.E. Warren Base in Wyoming, key personnel reported multiple independent UFO sightings that coincided with a power failure.

599
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,480
These five missile alert facilities could not communicate with the base and vice versa.

600
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:31,480
If war had been declared, they would have not gotten their orders to launch their missiles. Big deal.

601
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:43,480
John Mills, a retired missile targeting technician who still had many contacts at the base, provided Robert Hastings with multiple sources who all described the craft as gray in cigar shape.

602
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:49,480
The description I got was the thing was as large as, you know, maybe an aircraft carrier.

603
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:57,480
It was cigar shaped. It was tic-tac shaped, but it was not one of these small objects. It was like, quote, a mothership or something.

604
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:10,480
That's massive. Yeah, you talk about that in the book as perhaps, and this is you theorizing, there's a mothership that's kind of can be large and cigar shaped and then saucers coming out of the mothership and coming back into the mothership.

605
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:24,480
That's been described all over the world. And I cite a handful of cases in my book where people are seeing this huge cigar shaped object and out of one end or the other small disc shaped craft come out and fly in all directions.

606
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:35,480
The Air Force tried to downplay the incident, blaming it on a faulty circuit card. In fact, they claimed they only lost communication for a mere 59 minutes.

607
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:44,480
But Robert Hastings, being Robert Hastings, did some back channeling. According to John Mills, the blackout actually persisted for over 26 hours.

608
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:50,480
And in October of 2010, the Atlantic wrote a pretty telling article. It says, and I quote,

609
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:16,480
But here's where things get interesting. As of the making of this video, power and power failure is crossed out and replaced by the word engineering.

610
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:23,480
I think the Atlantic may have made a mistake here in showing the live tracking of this edit. You can see it in the screenshot right here.

611
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:31,480
OK, so at the very least, we know that these missiles were rendered inoperable and it represented a large enough national security issue to brief the president.

612
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:37,480
And you told me some of these witnesses had trouble in their careers. After this, they experienced some reprisals.

613
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:45,480
Presumably someone was monitoring communications between me and John and or he and the two technicians.

614
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:52,480
Anyway, someone was aware that they had been talking about these missile disruptions and a UFO presence.

615
01:00:52,480 --> 01:01:00,480
And when they each these two individuals, they coincidentally retired around the same time in the spring of 2011.

616
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:09,480
They were told on each occasion during their exit interview from the Air Force that a flag was being put in their folders,

617
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:18,480
citing them as a security risk so that if they sought employment with like an aerospace company or something in the future,

618
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:25,480
they would, you know, if someone checked their Air Force file, they would be the Air Force would have designated them to be security risks.

619
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:35,480
Another incident occurred at the Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, Area 2 weapons storage area.

620
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:44,480
More recently, civilians citing reports in Orange County, California, at the Naval Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station,

621
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,480
a series of bunkers, again, containing nuclear weapons.

622
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:55,480
There were local media reports of multiple sightings in March of 2009 near this weapons storage facility.

623
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:02,480
This is ongoing. This is the tip of the iceberg. We can only catch has catch can.

624
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:10,480
I am of the opinion that for every incident that I'm aware of and for witnesses that we've we've got in hand, there could be 10.

625
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:17,480
There could be 100. There could be many, many more incidents that I'll never know about because the people won't come forward.

626
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,480
They'll wait years or decades to talk about what they know.

627
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,480
Brother, this reports right now online. Anybody can see him.

628
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:32,480
The government released a bunch of UFO related documents not too long ago, a few years ago, thinking nobody would pay attention to like 10,000 reports.

629
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:43,480
And when you look in there, you see actual verbatim UFO incidents back in the 50s and 60s over the Savannah River facility over what Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

630
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:48,480
And by the way, it's still happening today. What the fuck is that, bro?

631
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:57,480
See how it goes. You're telling me we don't know what the hell these drones are in New Jersey are. Is that correct?

632
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,480
That's right. It's crazy.

633
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:05,480
Recently, there have been a flurry of new sightings that confirm the UFO nuclear connection is ongoing.

634
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:11,480
Strange objects have been hovering near bases in the UK and sensitive military sites in New Jersey.

635
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:20,480
Just a couple of months earlier, there were several mystery drone flights over our nuclear testing range in Nevada, just north of Las Vegas.

636
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,480
And again, nothing was done.

637
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,480
And where else are UFOs showing up right now?

638
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:38,480
I've just received information in the last few minutes about the PSEG nuclear site at Salem, which is the Hope Creek generating station on a 740 acre site in Salem County, New Jersey.

639
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:53,480
And a person who is privileged enough to have access to the internal messaging about that nuclear station has told me that they tried to deploy an anti drone technology over multiple drones that were seen over the nuclear site.

640
01:03:53,480 --> 01:04:00,480
And that anti drone technology, which normally works on all drones, completely failed.

641
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,480
Outside of New Jersey, where else have these UFOs shown up?

642
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:12,480
None other than the epicenter of all UFO reverse engineering rumors since Roswell, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

643
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:20,480
Med Flight 8 Patterson tower, use extreme caution for heavy UAS movement on the base. Security forces is handling the situation.

644
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,480
What else, when it comes to today's sightings, rhymes with the past?

645
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:34,480
Chris Mellon, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence under both Clinton and Bush, discusses a fascinating case on his blog.

646
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:47,480
UFO researcher Brad Sparks thoroughly documented a UFO heading towards Eisenhower's summer home in 1957 that was noted and documented secretly, both by NORAD and Project Blue Book at the time.

647
01:04:51,480 --> 01:05:01,480
This prompted an immediate presidential brief, including both Eisenhower and all of the directors of the U.S. intelligence community, that Monday morning, September 23rd.

648
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:09,480
As officially documented by NORAD, the UFOs were tracked on multiple radars simultaneously.

649
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:18,480
They varied in speed from 800 miles per hour to 12,000 miles per hour, with peak velocity occurring at 19,000 miles per hour.

650
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:27,480
They varied in altitude from 50,000 to 135,000 feet, which remains unattainable by aerospace vehicles even now.

651
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:32,480
And yes, they were headed directly at President Eisenhower's summer White House.

652
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:44,480
And now we find out that Donald J. Trump, the next American president, had to skip his trip to his Bedminster, New Jersey summer home because of these New Jersey drones.

653
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:52,480
They happen to be over Bedminster. I think maybe I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster. I've decided to cancel my trip.

654
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:57,480
And what else does Trump say when he's asked about these exotic drones and their origins?

655
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:06,480
Our military knows where they took off from. If it's a garage, they can go right into that garage. They know where it came from and where it went.

656
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:13,480
I can't imagine it's the enemy because it was the enemy that blasted out, even if they were late, that blasted.

657
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:18,480
Something strange is going on. For some reason, they don't want to tell the people, and they should.

658
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,480
So they're strange, they're likely not the enemy, and we know where they're coming from.

659
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:30,480
I would love to know the location of this garage.

660
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,480
And check out this video filmed in November of 2024.

661
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:41,480
Bro, what is that? Oh, my God. Here's the thing. These are not flashing lights like there are no runway lights.

662
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:50,480
Where exactly was this film? Right near Duke Energy's Brunswick nuclear plant in South Port, North Carolina.

663
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,480
I mean, look, the American people aren't stupid. You know, they're not.

664
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,480
Sometimes we might be a little bit slow to realize what's going on.

665
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:04,480
But, you know, in the words of Bob Marley, you can fool some people sometimes, but you can't fool all the people all the time.

666
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,480
And that's precisely, I think, what's happening here. This administration has been caught lying about a lot of things.

667
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:16,480
And look, this is not an anti-liberal or Democrat thing. This is just a dysfunctional administration.

668
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,480
What's going on in New Jersey right now with the so-called drones?

669
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,480
Let me tell you one thing. They're not drones. They aren't drones.

670
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,480
The U.S. Air Force obfuscates everything. The U.S. Air Force says they're drones. Don't you fucking believe it?

671
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:40,480
The U.S. Air Force also said that that thing that I saw did not happen. The U.S. Air Force lies. They obfuscate.

672
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:49,480
The Biden administration, for crying out loud, came out and said they're hallucinations. They're not hallucinations.

673
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:58,480
Look, those things are not just in New Jersey. They're in Great Britain. They're in Australia. They're in the Middle East. They're all over this country.

674
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:11,480
Lakenheath, Mildenhall, Feltwell, Fairford, Ramstein Air Force Base, Wright-Patterson, Nevada National Security Site, Hill Air Force Base, Lawrence Livermore Lab, Edwards Air Force Base, and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.

675
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:17,480
I don't want to sound like I'm an all-knowing guru about UFOs, but those are UFOs.

676
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:26,480
We are this close to nuclear annihilation right now. The danger has never been worse, never been more harsh, never been more believable.

677
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,480
So what are we seeing with these quote-unquote Jersey drones?

678
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:38,480
Well, there's a great general model for critical thinking proposed by Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century British statistician and philosopher.

679
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:44,480
It says that when you're looking at new data, you should use prior data to analyze it.

680
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:55,480
If somebody lies to you about important information four times and you catch them in those lies, the fifth time they say something to you, you should maybe doubt the veracity of what they're saying.

681
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:05,480
So if you don't have the data from Robert Hastings' work, your analysis of what's happening today in New Jersey and all around the world is going to be wildly off.

682
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:20,480
You're going to be subject to psychological manipulation by the media, Pentagon, and pretty much anyone trying to explain these sightings away as mass hysteria, hobbyist drones, or covert gamma ray detectors looking for nuclear material on the eastern seaboard.

683
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:28,480
All of these lies seem more likely as possibilities for truth if you don't have any prior data.

684
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:46,480
If you do know that DC was overrun by UFOs in 1952, if you know about Lincoln LaPauze's work, if you know about Bob Jacobs' sighting at Vandenberg in 1964, if you know about what Robert Sallis experienced in 1967, if you know about the F.E. Warren case as late as 2010,

685
01:09:46,480 --> 01:10:06,480
then all of this might seem more likely to be a simple UFO flap, the likes of which we've been seeing for the last 75 years with the exact same characteristics as what we're seeing today.

686
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:32,480
In 1994, 62 elementary school kids at the Ariel School in Zimbabwe said that they saw a silver craft descend from the sky and land on a field near the school.

687
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:41,480
Well, guess where the Ariel School was?

688
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:48,480
And what about that story that Vice ran in 2022 about a little town in Japan that's obsessed with UFOs?

689
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:56,480
It's a place called Eno, and it's actually right next to Fukushima's nuclear grid, which has been up and running since the 70s.

690
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:03,480
Because the town has been such a UFO hotspot, they even built a museum dedicated to UFOs in the 90s.

691
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:11,480
And after an earthquake famously triggered a nuclear power meltdown there in 2011, the chief monk of a local temple said,

692
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:19,480
The UFOs came after the explosion. There were so many of them. I was shocked. Radioactive energy was leaking everywhere.

693
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:26,480
I believe the UFOs came to readjust the flood of radioactive energy in order to save us.

694
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:34,480
Similarly, Harvard PhD Jensine Andreessen writes about UFO activity at the height of the Chernobyl disaster.

695
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:42,480
When many people in the area observed a UFO come, stay for three minutes, shine a light at the reactor and depart.

696
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:53,480
I could go on all day. In 1973, Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claimed that they were abducted and examined before being released by aliens while fishing near Pascagoula, Mississippi.

697
01:11:53,480 --> 01:12:00,480
Once inside the craft, Hickson remembers being examined by an oblong shaped instrument that hovered around him.

698
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,480
He was completely paralyzed. Only his eyes could move.

699
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,480
This came to be known as the famous Pascagoula abduction.

700
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:12,480
Well, people rarely point out that Pascagoula is a strategic nuclear site.

701
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,480
In fact, it's where most of the American nuclear subs were built at the time.

702
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:23,480
Even take the famous 2004 Nimitz sighting where a tic tac was detected by the USS Princeton.

703
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:31,480
Aircraft carriers like the USS Princeton are notoriously nuclear powered, and they might have some relevant precious cargo on board.

704
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:40,480
Even the Nimitz sighting of 2004, Lou Elizondo, I think he's sort of bound by his obligations and clearance and stuff.

705
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,480
And so he has to say, you know, I think Nimitz might be nuclear powered.

706
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:50,480
And then he's now gone as far as saying, and it might carry some tactical nukes on board, nukes on board or whatever.

707
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,480
OK, you get it. UFOs show up at nuclear sites.

708
01:12:53,480 --> 01:13:00,480
But beyond sporadic interference with our signals, how do we know they're occupied by any sort of sentient beings?

709
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,480
How do we even know these things are real physical aircrafts that land?

710
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:09,480
There were just multilevels with with all these small grays everywhere.

711
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:19,480
And I was following one and even the floor and the boards around the bottom of the floor had energy was everything emanated power.

712
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:24,480
I sat down with Mario Woods, a former U.S. Air Force security responder.

713
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:30,480
In 1977, he was stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota.

714
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:36,480
Then age 23, he experienced an incident that would change him forever,

715
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:44,480
literally leaving him with missing time marks on his body and a colleague locked in catatonic shock for hours.

716
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:49,480
OK, so you're in Ellsworth Air Force Base. It's 1977.

717
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,480
You have a partner that you're working with? Yeah, his name. Yeah, Michael Johnson.

718
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:59,480
He's a real light skinned black guy. He told me he was from Chicago, Illinois, and we only worked together that one day.

719
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:03,480
He was working vacation relief for my partner. His name was Steve Welchel.

720
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:08,480
I guess it was about nine o'clock, nine fifteen or so.

721
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:14,480
And I just walked outside and, you know, you're talking prairie land as far as you can see north and east and west.

722
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,480
And you don't see south because the buildings behind you.

723
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:24,480
And I see this light off to my east. It looks like like a mini moon.

724
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:35,480
I honestly thought it was the landing lights or some type of landing lights for B-52 bombers because the main base supported aircraft of B-52s.

725
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:47,480
Long story short, an hour later, he and his partner, two man security alert team partner,

726
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:53,480
are called. Suddenly there is an alert because some kind of intrusion at one of the missile sites is going on.

727
01:14:53,480 --> 01:15:00,480
And they didn't know what that was all about. Well, he and his partner drove to that site.

728
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:11,480
And as we turned left, there sat this object on top of November five that was about 10 feet in the air,

729
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:16,480
directly on top of that blast door that was the size of a Walmart building.

730
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:21,480
They're freaking out. They didn't even get to radio to base to tell them what they saw.

731
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:29,480
And all of a sudden, according to Mario, he and his partner suddenly,

732
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:33,480
it was like all the air in the crew cab was sucked out and they were suffocating.

733
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:39,480
They both suddenly started gasping for air, literally could not get a breath of air.

734
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,480
And I don't know if that was from my excitement.

735
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:47,480
I don't know. It's from adrenaline. I'm 23 years old. I was in excellent shape.

736
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:57,480
I feel something on my right side and I turn my head and I see these four, I'm going to call them beings.

737
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:03,480
And they are not walking as you and I walk. They are just gliding across the ground.

738
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:07,480
Maybe I don't know how high off the ground. I couldn't really see that.

739
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:12,480
But they have these little uniforms on and the one on the far right,

740
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:16,480
he had some type of a small one in his waist belt.

741
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:22,480
I've got a drawing of it that had a yellow tip on it, some type of a yellow tip.

742
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:28,480
But the one behind them was a chest and a head taller than the little guys.

743
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:34,480
And he had this thing on his chest right here that pulsated the same color as his chest.

744
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:39,480
That pulsated the same color as what was on that little one.

745
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:45,480
And when I saw him, then I was afraid. Then I felt fear.

746
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:55,480
And then I went black. That's the last thing that I saw in my mind.

747
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:59,480
And then the next thing he knew, and it seemed like the next minute,

748
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,480
he was somewhere that he didn't really recognize.

749
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,480
And somebody from base was calling on the radio saying,

750
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,480
Where are you? Where are you?

751
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,480
What turned out to be the case was he, his partner,

752
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:17,480
and the truck had been transported roughly five miles to a reservoir

753
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,480
near a little town of Newell, South Dakota.

754
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,480
Maybe 20 minutes passed.

755
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:31,480
So this backup alert team came, and I said, I don't know where I am.

756
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,480
I don't know where we are.

757
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,480
So I kept trying to communicate with Michael Johnson.

758
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,480
He wouldn't answer me in any way.

759
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,480
He was just frozen in this position looking straight ahead.

760
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:45,480
I even tried pulling his hand off that steering wheel, and he was just,

761
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:50,480
I don't know how a person can stay that tense for so long that they don't cramp up.

762
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,480
I would cramp up doing that, but he did.

763
01:17:55,480 --> 01:18:00,480
Even though it was terribly cold at night, I mean just ice cold, frigid,

764
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,480
he stepped out on the ground and sunk in wet mud.

765
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,480
So somehow the mud had been heated up right around the truck,

766
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:14,480
and he was standing, you know, like ankle deep, deep in wet mud on a sub-zero winter night.

767
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:20,480
Did Michael Johnson ever make it out of his catatonic state, your partner?

768
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,480
No, not while we were there.

769
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:28,480
When Sergeant Garza pulled up, he pulled up within, say, 60 feet.

770
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,480
I said, hey, Sergeant Garza, how's it going?

771
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,480
I said, what's going on?

772
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:34,480
He said, Mario, I can't talk to you about this.

773
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:38,480
He said, I'm just here to escort you back to November Control.

774
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,480
So they lead him back to base.

775
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:44,480
He's debriefed basically by, I think, the squadron commander

776
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:48,480
and someone who turned out to be an OSI agent.

777
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:51,480
He's taken to the base hospital and examined.

778
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:56,480
He finds, I think it was on his forehead and his ankle.

779
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,480
There was a circular wound or depression of some kind

780
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,480
with a little dimple in the center.

781
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:03,480
Do you still have the marks at all?

782
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,480
Yeah.

783
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,480
Can I see them?

784
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,480
Sure.

785
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,480
I had these socks on.

786
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,480
Wow, wow, wow.

787
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,480
If you can see it.

788
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,480
Wow.

789
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:16,480
Yeah, those look, I mean, just like perfectly vertically aligned,

790
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:20,480
but like so clearly not like a spider, but like way too big for that.

791
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,480
Yeah.

792
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,480
Like, you know.

793
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,480
Yeah.

794
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,480
They just kept asking questions.

795
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,480
And I got to the point where everything was just at one time

796
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:33,480
coming from every space in my mind, questions about the whole deal.

797
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:36,480
And I said, hey, I got to go to the restroom.

798
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,480
And I just went and sat on the toilet.

799
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:43,480
And all of a sudden, Jesse, I get this ringing in my ears

800
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,480
that was as if somebody struck a Liberty Bell right next to my head.

801
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,480
I mean, really, I have to emphasize that

802
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,480
it was like it got my attention.

803
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:58,480
But when it happened, everything turned like lime green to me, like pea green.

804
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,480
I closed my eyes.

805
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:04,480
And when I did, I had this feeling I was leaving my body.

806
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:08,480
Literally, I was, you know, I thought I was dying.

807
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,480
I said, I guess this is how you die.

808
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,480
So they left or were leaving.

809
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:16,480
And I opened up the stall door and I just went to the sink.

810
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:21,480
And mind you, I still have on my long johns and my fatigue pants and shirt

811
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,480
and just drowning myself in water.

812
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:25,480
I was just soaking wet.

813
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,480
Because Master Sergeant Gray said something to me as I came out there.

814
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,480
He said, what did you do, climb in the sink or something like that?

815
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,480
And I don't even know if I answered.

816
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:37,480
I just said, yes, sir.

817
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:40,480
So I grabbed my stuff and immediately I said, well, what about Michael Johnson?

818
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,480
He said, don't worry about him.

819
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,480
He'll be going with Sergeant Hawkins.

820
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,480
I said, OK.

821
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,480
And I really wanted to talk to him.

822
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:50,480
But immediately upon arrival at that site, we were separated right then and there.

823
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,480
And I don't know what good it would have done because he wasn't coherent

824
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,480
or wasn't answering or anything anyway.

825
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:56,480
So he hadn't said a word to you?

826
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,480
Nothing.

827
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:58,480
Not one word that I knew of.

828
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,480
Not one word.

829
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,480
He hadn't said anything to me or to anybody else that was there.

830
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,480
Every time I asked about Michael Johnson, they kept telling me,

831
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,480
don't worry about Michael Johnson.

832
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,480
He's fine.

833
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:09,480
He's fine.

834
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,480
Really bothered me.

835
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,480
Yeah.

836
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,480
It almost sounds like they're covering for something.

837
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,480
Yeah.

838
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,480
Don't worry about Michael Johnson.

839
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,480
He is fine.

840
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:18,480
Off we went to Ellsworth.

841
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,480
And it was about an hour, 10 minute ride back to Ellsworth.

842
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,480
Went to Ralph Eastbreaker's office under escort.

843
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:30,480
And I remember him saying, sounds as if you've had an interesting evening

844
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,480
or night or something like that.

845
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,480
And I said, yes, sir.

846
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:37,480
And I looked to my left, and there's a total of five people in that room.

847
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:41,480
There's the deputy base commander, who I don't remember his name.

848
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:46,480
But next to him was a man in a gray tweed suit with a hat.

849
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,480
And the hat was under his arm.

850
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:54,480
Then there was a captain, Jack Reed, OSI.

851
01:21:54,480 --> 01:22:00,480
Next to him was this new OSI guy named Rick Doty.

852
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,480
Interesting.

853
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,480
Yeah.

854
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:06,480
Because the first time I saw him was on Ancient Aliens.

855
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,480
And I said, I know that guy.

856
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:08,480
He was at my debrief.

857
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:12,480
I was a counterintelligence officer for the Air Force Office of Special Investigation.

858
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:18,480
I was personally fascinated by the fact that Richard Doty had been involved in the aftermath of Mario's case.

859
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:23,480
I knew about Doty because of a great book called Project Beta by Greg Bishop.

860
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:29,480
Doty was an Air Force counterintelligence agent basically tasked with performing a psychological operation

861
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:35,480
on an innocent researcher named Paul Benowitz who had seen an exotic craft at Kirtland Air Force Base.

862
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:40,480
Doty convinced Benowitz that he was in touch with aliens, even receiving signals on his computer.

863
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,480
This eventually drove Benowitz into psychiatric hospitalization.

864
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:52,480
So the fact that Doty was part of Mario's debrief is fascinating, seems very important, and requires follow up by some brave souls.

865
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,480
And up to that point, I had nobody.

866
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,480
Yeah.

867
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:59,480
I had nobody that could say, yeah, they were there or what have you.

868
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:05,480
I tried running down my old flight chief and assistant flight chief, but with no success or anybody else.

869
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,480
And especially Michael Johnson.

870
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:10,480
Some money has been spent trying to locate Michael Johnson.

871
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,480
We've looked in hospitals.

872
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,480
We've looked in...

873
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,480
Can't find him anywhere.

874
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,480
No, sir.

875
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:19,480
And I reported that to Arrow in March of 23, I think, when I spoke with them.

876
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,480
Did Arrow follow up at all?

877
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,480
I don't know. They never got back with me.

878
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:26,480
Four hours and 19 minutes, I spoke with them.

879
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,480
That's crazy.

880
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:31,480
And they said I would get a copy of everything which had been talked about.

881
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,480
Can you contact Michael Johnson's family?

882
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,480
I don't have any numbers or anything.

883
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,480
He said he was from Chicago, Illinois.

884
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:45,480
Believe me, every resource, including other law enforcement officers that I know, today's technology, have not located him yet.

885
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,480
Neither has Arrow.

886
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,480
So what was your interaction with Doty?

887
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,480
You mean in the email?

888
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:52,480
Initially.

889
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:55,480
No, when you first meet him, he's in this room full of five people.

890
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,480
Nothing.

891
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,480
He wasn't that...

892
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:59,480
We never spoke or anything like that.

893
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:03,480
He was directly reporting to Captain Jack Reed next to him.

894
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:04,480
So that's fascinating, right?

895
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:10,480
That this guy who's clearly this disinfo agent, at least in the context of Benoist, and you don't know why...

896
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,480
He was brand new.

897
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,480
He was brand new then.

898
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:28,480
So as a person that's very high in this whole thing said, those were the days when he was probably, honestly, not changed in any way, perhaps.

899
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,480
I just want to say that the right way.

900
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:39,480
Because I email him once in a while, and he'll answer me back, whereas it took me about five years to get him to even do that.

901
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:43,480
And then we got to be on a cast together.

902
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,480
So real quick, just context.

903
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:52,480
He now has come out saying he's reformed and he apologizes for his malpractice in the past.

904
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,480
A lot of people are suspicious of that reform.

905
01:24:55,480 --> 01:25:03,480
It does feel a little bit sometimes to me like he's flooding the zone with disinfo, like he'll talk about six alien races.

906
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:07,480
This crystal rectangle came from an actual alien craft.

907
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:11,480
And it just seems extremely speculative and not based on any sort of evidence.

908
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,480
Correct.

909
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,480
Very weird.

910
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,480
Yeah, it's more than I know how to swallow.

911
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:19,480
I only know that what I witnessed is my incident.

912
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,480
So how many were there?

913
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:33,480
A gentleman named Jared Tarbell, who is my benefactor, he supported my research.

914
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:37,480
He paid to have Mario regressed, a regression hypnosis session.

915
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:46,480
In the video of the session where Mario is being regressed back to that night, he becomes utterly terrified.

916
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:50,480
I've never seen anybody reliving an abduction experience.

917
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,480
He had a very long head.

918
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,480
They look like grays.

919
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:08,480
They look like the small grays, but the one behind them, I guess you would classify him as a tall gray.

920
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:17,480
On Whitley Strieber's book, Communion, of course, the first time I saw that picture, I froze in my stride.

921
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,480
And I had to have that book.

922
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:23,480
And Barnes and Noble or wherever it was at the time when it came out.

923
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:34,480
And I literally, before I opened to the first page, I literally just sat and stared at that picture for many hours before I ever even read his book.

924
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,480
What was the craft like?

925
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:37,480
So you're in the inside of this thing.

926
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,480
What did it look like?

927
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,480
A beehive.

928
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,480
A beehive?

929
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,480
Yeah.

930
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:44,480
How so?

931
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:51,480
From my looking around, as I did in that playground, like I always try to take a mental picture of something.

932
01:26:55,480 --> 01:27:02,480
They were just multilevels with all these small grays everywhere, going to and fro and doing whatever they were doing.

933
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:09,480
I just got to look for a moment and I was following one and even the floor and the boards around the bottom of the floor.

934
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,480
Had energy.

935
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:17,480
Everything emanated power in some way.

936
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,480
The walls.

937
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:21,480
Was there a humming associated?

938
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,480
Not that I can remember.

939
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:27,480
And it almost felt like the tall gray was maybe in charge of these smaller grays?

940
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,480
Absolutely.

941
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:29,480
In that room.

942
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:33,480
Another thing too, I was not on a table.

943
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:51,480
I was from my memory, I was on some type of a, I was like wrapped in a triangular kind of beam or something that was body length, about four foot in the air.

944
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:59,480
And as like a strange light would not a strange light.

945
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:12,480
It's even hard to describe, but it was as if I was inserted in something that was some type of a force field or some kind of a, a holding field that they could move you around in.

946
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:19,480
Like a gurney without wheels, a table without a back or wheels or legs attached to it.

947
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:29,480
And I felt as if, you know, they, when they reached in or when he lifted my arm up, lifted me up right here on my wrist.

948
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:36,480
You know, it exited that, that pyramidal field or whatever it was above me.

949
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:39,480
And it was in his atmosphere at that time.

950
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:45,480
If you had kind of a best guest, do you think they had positive intentions or negative or?

951
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:46,480
I think they had positive.

952
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,480
What do you think?

953
01:28:47,480 --> 01:29:00,480
But they fulfill their mission, whatever that mission is, whether it's to obtain DNA material or what have you, or some kind of a programming or I don't know any, whatever they want to do, they're going to do.

954
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:07,480
Outside of like the obvious, which is you experienced this kind of crazy paranormal disruption in your life.

955
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:12,480
Did this kind of, was this an inflection point or did it change your life in a dramatic way afterwards?

956
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,480
Oh, it did.

957
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,480
How so?

958
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,480
I had to find out everything about archaeology and pyramids.

959
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:25,480
And so that was just something that it almost felt like it was installed inside of you or downloaded.

960
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,480
Yes.

961
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,480
And why?

962
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:28,480
Still today.

963
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,480
Why do you think you became so interested in that?

964
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,480
I have no idea.

965
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:43,480
If I was a betting man, some of this NHI, they're similarly as advanced as us, but they've just made, they've, what is it, asymmetric evolution or whatever.

966
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:47,480
They want a different path where we made nuclear weapons and stuff.

967
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:59,480
They ended up making this like civil propulsion kind of equivalent discovery where they're able to do this now, but they're actually not that much more advanced than you and I.

968
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:12,480
It just makes you wonder how much technology that has been buried somehow or another has been removed from our everyday conscious thought.

969
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:21,480
I do think that this technology that we're speaking of, even though we don't know it truly exists, it points to its existence in some way.

970
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,480
And one day I think we will find a magic key.

971
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:37,480
Somewhere there's a craft, if it hasn't already been discovered, that's sitting in a cave somewhere or under the ocean somewhere, under a ledge somewhere, or maybe even circling the planet invisible that we can't see we're going to run into one day.

972
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,480
I don't know.

973
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:52,480
So there's clearly, obviously, at this point in the interview, a well-demonstrated pattern between UFOs and nuclear weapons.

974
01:30:52,480 --> 01:31:10,480
And this brings up a really interesting kind of weird analog to all of this, which is that Gary Nolan, Stanford microbiologist, has said that historically, legacy UFO programs have used nuclear material or sometimes even phony nuclear material to bait UFOs to show up.

975
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:16,480
And I believe we even have documentation that the Russians did this in the 90s as well.

976
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,480
Do you have anything to say about that?

977
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:41,480
I'm aware that a former or retired Soviet Army colonel has said, I can't remember the gentleman's name, but he's on video on the Internet saying that at some point during the Soviet era, he was part of a military exercise that was intentionally designed to try to attract UFOs.

978
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:51,480
And what they began doing was doing military exercises like maneuvers with no nuclear components, just conventional armaments and so on.

979
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:55,480
And then they waited to see what would happen, and there were no UFO sightings.

980
01:31:55,480 --> 01:32:05,480
As soon as they brought nuclear battlefield nukes to the equation and they were out in the field with the other armaments, suddenly UFO sightings began.

981
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:17,480
And so in this colonel's estimate, they succeeded in attracting whoever was flying the UFOs by merely introducing the presence of nuclear weapons to the situation.

982
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:21,480
Are you familiar with the Chinese science fiction novel, The Three-Body Problem?

983
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:22,480
No.

984
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:34,480
Well, in it, basically the non-human intelligence or aliens or whatever have a special interest in scientists working on the most frontier technology.

985
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:38,480
And they view that technology as most deadly or likely to end the world.

986
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:51,480
And so in some cases, they actually intentionally kind of stagnate the physics or send scientists in the wrong direction or sort of use confusion tactics to actually get them to stall their progress.

987
01:32:51,480 --> 01:33:02,480
And I've actually heard in a couple of instances that the aliens might be interested in other sort of frontier tech, like proximity fuses, other sorts of things like that.

988
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:11,480
Do you think that maybe we are being prompted on the one hand scientifically for certain past creations?

989
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:17,480
And then maybe there needs to be kind of in-step progress made with our consciousness.

990
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:21,480
And if that's not made, the NHI actually have to step in and kind of stop things.

991
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:28,480
And the nuclear thing is this big juncture where you have this big asymmetric leap on the tech front.

992
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:31,480
You don't have the asymmetric consciousness leap.

993
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:37,480
And so that's why it's so consistent with nukes in particular.

994
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:46,480
My personal opinion is that we have had probably ongoing contact with whoever these entities are for thousands of years.

995
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:52,480
I think it's conceivable they've interjected themselves into our culture and maybe even our biology.

996
01:33:52,480 --> 01:34:03,480
I'm not aware of any definitive evidence, but I wouldn't be surprised if they had periodically interjected themselves into our evolution to upgrade the species, so to speak.

997
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:09,480
I can't prove that, of course. I don't think anyone can, but I think it's an interesting hypothesis.

998
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:17,480
The link between an increase in sightings and the advent of the nuclear age is thoroughly documented.

999
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:23,480
The people on the inside, like Lou, who are now coming forward and talking, Lou Elizondo,

1000
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:34,480
confirmed that what my witnesses have told me over the years is a central part of the equation, the nuclear link with UFO activity.

1001
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:47,480
So in answer to your question, I don't know. I don't have any way of evaluating what specifically has been done, whether they've prompted us in some ways and held us back in other ways. I don't know.

1002
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:51,480
We are not here to evangelize any single theory. That's up for you to decide.

1003
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:54,480
We're just going to lay some of these theories out for you.

1004
01:34:54,480 --> 01:35:01,480
Number one, the benevolent protector theory. These UFOs are here because they don't want us to destroy ourselves.

1005
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:05,480
By tampering with our nukes, they want to show us that we're playing with fire.

1006
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:11,480
Join us and live in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration.

1007
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:15,480
It's kind of like taking matches out of the hands of a baby.

1008
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:18,480
Whoa. Yeah. Whoa. Right.

1009
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:22,480
If they are out there and they are disabling our nukes, they're not doing it because they're a threat to us.

1010
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:29,480
They're doing it because we're a threat to ourselves and maybe we're a threat to some aspects of the universe.

1011
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:36,480
Number two, parasitic host theory. Maybe UFOs are, in fact, deterring us from nuclear war.

1012
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:43,480
But because they're just protecting their resources, they're mining us for something and don't care about us at all.

1013
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:52,480
By the way, this is not mutually exclusive with benevolent protector theory, especially if there are factions of non-human intelligence.

1014
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:56,480
If they have projects here, if they have bases here, they have bases here.

1015
01:35:56,480 --> 01:36:07,480
A worldwide nuclear catastrophe is going to drastically impact what they've got going on in addition to what we as humans and our civilization have at risk.

1016
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:14,480
And therefore it doesn't have to necessarily be just altruistic. It could be a self-serving motivation as well.

1017
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:23,480
Number three, UFOs are somehow affected by the electromagnetic fallout from nuclear tests.

1018
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:32,480
Gamma radiation following atomic blasts messes with the flight path of UFOs and pops them into our reality.

1019
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:35,480
This is a very interesting theory and still very possible.

1020
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:45,480
But it wouldn't fully explain why UFOs show up around atomic assets when there are no nuclear blasts.

1021
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:50,480
Again, this theory is not mutually exclusive with option one or two.

1022
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:58,480
Number four, simulation theory. Humans are in a low-level time-bound dimension that these UFOs have transcended.

1023
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:03,480
The UFOs want to monitor our ability to break out of our simulation.

1024
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:08,480
One of the ways to break out would be through high-energy nuclear physics.

1025
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:17,480
Right now, our biggest nukes emit 80 to 100 megatons of TNT.

1026
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:25,480
If we get upwards of one times 10 to the ninth tons of TNT, we might be able to start ripping little holes in spacetime.

1027
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:34,480
So aliens might be monitoring the axis of human progress and energy output as we inch out of our 3D time-bound cave.

1028
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:40,480
I think the Tsar Bomb is something like 10 to the sixth tons of TNT or something.

1029
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,480
The largest nuclear detonation, yeah.

1030
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:49,480
And I think once you get to 10 to the ninth and up, you know, you start to rip little holes in spacetime or something like that.

1031
01:37:50,480 --> 01:38:02,480
And so is there something around nuclear that somehow speaks to the fabric of spacetime itself and allows us to see other worlds that might exist all the time,

1032
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:08,480
but we just somehow don't have the aperture for it without this sort of nuclear leakage?

1033
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:17,480
What I've said, and when I hear that, you know, you have to consider that every star in the universe is nothing but nonstop nuclear detonations,

1034
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:22,480
you know, on a vastly larger scale than what we humans do here on Earth.

1035
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:31,480
You know, so one would think if somehow our detonations are ripping holes in spacetime, why wouldn't every star in the universe rip holes in spacetime?

1036
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:33,480
But, you know, so that's my point.

1037
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:41,480
Number five, UFOs are just secret American anti-gravity exotic propulsion co-located on nuclear basis.

1038
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:46,480
As somebody who's gone decently deep on gravity research mid-century, I would actually entertain this.

1039
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:51,480
But it just doesn't account for what happened to Mario Woods and Jim Peniston at Rendlesham.

1040
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:57,480
This also wouldn't explain UFO sightings around nuclear bases that occur as early as the 40s.

1041
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:02,480
I just don't believe that man-made exotic propulsion technology was that good at the time.

1042
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:09,480
Number six, and maybe my favorite theory, I think this is as entertaining as it is maybe unlikely,

1043
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:19,480
but there are apparently folks in the American national security state that say that the German Netflix show Dark points to bits of reality.

1044
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:24,480
In this theory, nuclear fuels were used mid-century to alter gravity.

1045
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:28,480
We know that gravity and time are linked in general relativity.

1046
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:34,480
So maybe with the exotic gravity research we were doing in the 50s, we were also looking into manipulating time.

1047
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:39,480
And that research may have been taking place on nuclear bases across the United States.

1048
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:43,480
I admit it's hard for me to believe that we perfected time travel,

1049
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:47,480
but if we do ever perfect time travel in the future,

1050
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:53,480
these programs would be co-located at our most sensitive national security sites.

1051
01:39:55,480 --> 01:40:01,480
You know, Lawrence Bell aircraft, so they broke the sound barrier in 1947.

1052
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:02,480
Yeah, yeah, X-15.

1053
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,480
X-15, Chuck Yeager, exactly.

1054
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:10,480
And so there's an article in 1956 where they're saying we're going to beat gravity and it's right around the bend.

1055
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:17,480
And Lawrence Bell's quote from this article is we are already working with nuclear fuels to cancel out gravity.

1056
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:24,480
And so you got to think if time travel is possible at any point in the future, it's probably always been possible, right?

1057
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:28,480
And so where would we discover some sort of time travel program?

1058
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:31,480
It would probably be co-located with nuclear programs.

1059
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:32,480
Absolutely.

1060
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,480
And then how would you affect timelines?

1061
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:39,480
You might do it with particular people who represent kind of nodes or whatever,

1062
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:43,480
who get interested in things like pyramids after their encounters.

1063
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:46,480
And so do you think that that's a possible explanation,

1064
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:52,480
that maybe a future time travel program represents an overlay over all of these nuclear sites

1065
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:56,480
in a way that somehow might profoundly shift humanity

1066
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,480
and might also keep us alive?

1067
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:04,480
Because if you think about where is the center of the apocalypse, it's these nuclear sites.

1068
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:08,480
I mean, what's going to dictate the end of the world or not?

1069
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,480
You know, it's going to be these sites.

1070
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:17,480
So maybe with UFO abductions, we are experiencing remnants of a future time travel program

1071
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:20,480
that is co-located with our nuclear assets.

1072
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:24,480
Just look at what famed director Steven Spielberg had to say.

1073
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:29,480
What if they're not from an advanced civilization, 300 million light years from here?

1074
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:34,480
But what if it's us, 500,000 years into the future?

1075
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:39,480
In fact, the most prolific gravity-related inventor mid-century

1076
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:42,480
was the aforementioned Thomas Townsend Brown.

1077
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:46,480
But people don't know that Townsend Brown was actually obsessed with time travel.

1078
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:49,480
He even sort of referred to himself as a time traveler.

1079
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:54,480
When I asked Brown's daughter what Townsend would be up to if he is in fact a time traveler,

1080
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,480
this is what she had to say.

1081
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:24,480
Obviously, this secret time travel theory might be imperfect or rather incomplete.

1082
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:29,480
It would not, for example, explain UFOs coming out of the plume of nuclear blasts.

1083
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:34,480
I should also add that none of these theories really characterized the beings themselves.

1084
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:38,480
They could be a whole host of things, time traveling humans,

1085
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:44,480
remnants of a technologically advanced civilization co-located with our nuclear assets.

1086
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:50,480
Time traveling humans, remnants of a technologically advanced civilization co-located on Earth,

1087
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:53,480
or your classic extraterrestrials.

1088
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:58,480
And not to confuse you too much, but even these options could be false dichotomies

1089
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,480
and are not always mutually exclusive.

1090
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:05,480
Free your mind.

1091
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:09,480
I've said this to other people.

1092
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:13,480
Sometimes I see us when we're being crazy and talking about nuclear war

1093
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:18,480
that we might be cage 22 in a universal lab somewhere

1094
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,480
and they come and check us every once in a while to see if we're going to kill each other

1095
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:24,480
and they might be just monitoring us to keep us peaceful.

1096
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:25,480
No way of telling.

1097
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:31,480
It's been so, they've been so not physical so far.

1098
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:35,480
So I hope it's that and I hope there's something good to come from this.

1099
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:42,480
Now at this point, you're probably asking, why isn't this more widely known?

1100
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:46,480
UFOs showing up across the most sensitive global nuclear sites.

1101
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:49,480
That's insane and everyone should know about.

1102
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:50,480
I agree with you.

1103
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:56,480
Now would probably be a good time to note that the people who have done the most damage to the UFO conversation

1104
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:01,480
have come from the same atomic programs that are actively investigating UFOs

1105
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:03,480
and trying to keep them secret.

1106
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:07,480
I find it really interesting that you have some of the most prominent debunkers,

1107
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:13,480
guys like Menzel, guys like Condon, H.P. Robertson, who were kind of big shots,

1108
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,480
who also worked on the Manhattan Project.

1109
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:17,480
Condon was involved.

1110
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:19,480
Oh, I didn't realize that.

1111
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:22,480
He worked with Vannevar Bush a lot.

1112
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:23,480
Oh really?

1113
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:25,480
Oh yeah.

1114
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:32,480
The Condon committee was supposed to be an open, independent investigation of UFOs in 1966

1115
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:35,480
at the tail end of Project Blue Book.

1116
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:38,480
Among the project's dozen experts are Director Dr. Edward Condon,

1117
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:41,480
formerly physicist with the National Bureau of Standards.

1118
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:45,480
The whole project was led by a quantum physicist named Edward Condon.

1119
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:47,480
Air Force wanted to get out of this job.

1120
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:50,480
They commissioned a study from University of Colorado.

1121
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:54,480
Ed Condon led the studies, a Manhattan Project alum.

1122
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:59,480
He wrote the conclusion of the study before the study was complete, bragged about it.

1123
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:03,480
A lot of the scientists on the study defected publicly from the study.

1124
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:05,480
The study got published.

1125
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:09,480
The content of the study is at odds with the conclusions,

1126
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:12,480
but the Air Force canceled Project Blue Book anyway.

1127
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:19,480
What most people don't know is that Edward Condon was a complete Manhattan Project insider.

1128
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:22,480
He was very close to Robert Oppenheimer,

1129
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:27,480
having studied under Max Born with him at Göttingen in Germany in the 20s.

1130
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:31,480
In fact, Condon and Oppenheimer were so close that Condon was partly credited

1131
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:35,480
for picking Los Alamos as the focal point for the Manhattan Project.

1132
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:39,480
He knew the area well, having grown up around the corner in Alamogordo.

1133
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:43,480
He also recruited a lot of the project's early staff

1134
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:49,480
and wrote the Los Alamos primer, which all employees had to read upon arrival.

1135
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:53,480
We would welcome not only better evidence about them,

1136
01:45:53,480 --> 01:46:00,480
but also suggestions as to better ways of investigation.

1137
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:04,480
The Condon Commission was a supposedly independent UFO review panel,

1138
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:07,480
paid for but not influenced by the Air Force.

1139
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:12,480
But later, from verified letters, we learned that Condon was closely coordinating

1140
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:17,480
with Air Force Colonel Robert Hippler, who had expressed pretty clear written desire

1141
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:20,480
that all previous UFO research, including Project Blue Book,

1142
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:23,480
be shown as a waste of time and money.

1143
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:27,480
Condon successfully performed his hit job, Blue Book ended,

1144
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:33,480
and UFO research would become quackery for another 50 years.

1145
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:35,480
Now fast forward to today.

1146
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:39,480
Arrow is a member of the department's support to the administration's Tiger Team effort

1147
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:43,480
to deal with stratospheric objects such as the PRC high-altitude balloon.

1148
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:47,480
Arrow continues this tradition of downplaying, dismissing,

1149
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:50,480
or even possibly destroying UFO evidence

1150
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:54,480
after having some pretty interesting ties to nuclear programs.

1151
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:59,480
In early 2023, January 2023,

1152
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:06,480
Kurt McConnell, who is a retired Senate Armed Service Committee investigator,

1153
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:11,480
contacted me and said Arrow wants you to get together some of the veterans

1154
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:15,480
who had experiences at nuclear weapons sites and they want to interview them.

1155
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:17,480
Would you be willing to do that?

1156
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:20,480
So long story short, I think it was 11 people,

1157
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:24,480
veterans I had interviewed over the years, went and spoke with Arrow.

1158
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:31,480
And so at some point, this would have been March of 2023,

1159
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:34,480
McConnell, Kurt McConnell, sent me an email saying,

1160
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:37,480
I drove Lou down to his interview with Arrow.

1161
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:42,480
On the way back from his interview, Lou told me that he told Kirkpatrick

1162
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:45,480
that he had seen the Big Sur film,

1163
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:49,480
the shoot down of a dummy nuclear warhead by a UFO

1164
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:54,480
that Dr. Bob Jacobs has talked about for decades and decades.

1165
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:58,480
Lou told Kirkpatrick where he had seen the film.

1166
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:02,480
It was in a safe drawer, I was told.

1167
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:06,480
And Kirkpatrick allegedly went and looked at the,

1168
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,480
tried to find it and claimed it was not there.

1169
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:16,480
He's now left Arrow, but he is part of the supposed official UFO review program.

1170
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:21,480
And so we're now saying that actually UFO programs were probably really bound up

1171
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:26,480
with American atomic programs since kind of 1940s, 1950s.

1172
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:30,480
And you look at Sean Kirkpatrick's track record and his resume,

1173
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:35,480
when he was 17 years old, he was given a grant by the Department of Energy

1174
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:38,480
because of impressing them at Brookhaven Lab.

1175
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:42,480
I think he went to Brookhaven Labs as a result of this grant or something.

1176
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:45,480
He worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,

1177
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:49,480
a clear atomic site, one of the oldest ones in Tennessee.

1178
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:51,480
If you look at some of his research gate papers,

1179
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:54,480
they're very interesting when it comes to the UFO phenomenon.

1180
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:59,480
That's all I'll say. I think viewers should go look up some of this stuff.

1181
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:05,480
His company was released, I believe, and it was called Nonlinear LLC, something like that.

1182
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:08,480
Nonlinear algebra is one of the things that you need

1183
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,480
when studying gravity and some of this kind of weirder stuff.

1184
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:14,480
And then finally, the only thing he consistently says is,

1185
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:17,480
we have no evidence of extraterrestrials.

1186
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:19,480
He always says that, extraterrestrial, extraterrestrial.

1187
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:22,480
Extraterrestrial is an extrapolation.

1188
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:26,480
That is a conclusion that you've come to that this thing is definitely

1189
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:30,480
from Zeta Reticuli or Proxima Centauri or some other planet.

1190
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:34,480
So it's very easy to say that and act like you're not lying

1191
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,480
when, of course, we don't have evidence.

1192
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:39,480
There are probably theorists still working on where these things are from.

1193
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:43,480
Are they from other planets? Are they from different dimensions? Who knows?

1194
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:48,480
But it's very easy for him to do that, and he just rests on that over and over again.

1195
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:52,480
When I wrote to the veterans, I'm still in touch with roughly 20 people

1196
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:56,480
that I interviewed years ago, and I still have contact information for them.

1197
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:58,480
So I wrote to all those guys.

1198
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:02,480
I think it was 11 of roughly 20 who agreed to speak with Arrow.

1199
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:05,480
In the email that I sent to these guys, I said,

1200
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:08,480
my opinion is that Arrow is a front.

1201
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:11,480
It's the Condon Committee 2.0.

1202
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:18,480
In my opinion, Kirk Packer is a shill for somebody, possibly CIA, DIA, NSA, whoever.

1203
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:24,480
I said, you can talk your heart out and describe what happened to you in the missile field,

1204
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:27,480
but they're not going to take it seriously.

1205
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:33,480
But I might be wrong, and on the off chance that miracles sometimes happen,

1206
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:41,480
maybe your testimony will have some impact, and therefore I urge you to go and speak to Arrow.

1207
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:46,480
Well, they did, and I subsequently learned that Arrow,

1208
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:52,480
the people that took the testimony from these veterans, did not record them.

1209
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:56,480
They were told, a couple of the veterans were told, well, we're taking notes.

1210
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:59,480
Well, if you're conducting a serious investigation,

1211
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:03,480
you want to tape record every word, every grunt, every syllable,

1212
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:07,480
and they did not record any of the interviews according to the veterans,

1213
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:10,480
and they, quote, took notes.

1214
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:14,480
And then the culmination, of course, was when Kirk Patrick

1215
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:19,480
addressed Senator Gillibrand's committee in April of 23 and said,

1216
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,480
we had point blank, you know, blanket statement.

1217
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:27,480
We were presented with no evidence that these were extraterrestrial crap.

1218
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:31,480
And all the veterans immediately, you know, over the course of a few days,

1219
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:37,480
wrote to me and said, you know, they betrayed us, Arrow betrayed us, Kirk Patrick betrayed us.

1220
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:42,480
You know, we stuck our necks out and talked about UFOs shutting down our nuclear missiles

1221
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:48,480
in the 60s and 70s before, you know, decades before we or the Russians or the Chinese

1222
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:52,480
had any technology that could have done what we saw with our own eyes.

1223
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:56,480
Clearly, it was something off Earth going on, and yet, you know,

1224
01:51:56,480 --> 01:52:01,480
we stuck our necks out, talked to Arrow, and that's what this guy says to Congress.

1225
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:05,480
Yeah, you have these American patriots who signed up to guard

1226
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:09,480
our most important national defense assets who've been traumatized by what they've seen.

1227
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:15,480
And I just want the American public to know the basic ontological truth of what they've experienced,

1228
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:20,480
which is an experience that is widespread and it's global,

1229
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:24,480
and it's not conferring any sort of advantage to an adversary by letting this out.

1230
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:26,480
And you have this guy and Kirk Patrick.

1231
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:29,480
And this is why I think it needs to be more widely known,

1232
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:34,480
because I think I've heard that a lot from people on the inside where it's like hoping on a prayer.

1233
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:38,480
I mean, I think Arrow is worthless, but maybe I'll testify and talk to them.

1234
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:39,480
I think it's more insidious than that.

1235
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:43,480
I think they take your testimony and they try to destroy the evidence.

1236
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:47,480
And so it's just absolutely horrible.

1237
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:53,480
I have never from day one thought that there was any merit to Arrow, and I still don't.

1238
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:56,480
And no matter who is in control, the fix is in.

1239
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:59,480
It's, you know, it's a smokescreen.

1240
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:03,480
It's more of a project blue book, you know, for our time frame.

1241
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:06,480
And what about Brookhaven National Labs in Long Island?

1242
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:08,480
Have any crashes occurred there?

1243
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:10,480
It's about seven o'clock at night.

1244
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:13,480
And being November, it was full dark.

1245
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:17,480
And all of a sudden it was lighter out than it is right now.

1246
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:22,480
Brookhaven is associated with Stony Brook University

1247
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:27,480
and the legendary hedge fund manager and mathematician Jim Simons.

1248
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:33,480
Now, just look at who ran the independent NASA review panel on UAPs in 2022.

1249
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:35,480
Might they have any ties to Jim Simons?

1250
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:39,480
You don't have to be the conspiracy theorist drawing the red dots on the yarn

1251
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:44,480
to be like, here's a money-making machine started by a guy deeply connected to the NSA

1252
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,480
that's also like a super physics genius

1253
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:49,480
and it can attract the smartest physics and math people on the planet

1254
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:51,480
to work for his black box money machine.

1255
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:58,480
And his, you know, guy running his private research foundation in fundamental physics

1256
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,480
gets tapped to run the UAP working group for NASA.

1257
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:05,480
Yeah, a working group that sort of says, you know, nothing to see here.

1258
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:08,480
Like we will keep an open mind, but there's probably nothing here,

1259
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:10,480
which I find interesting.

1260
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:16,480
It is essential to clarify, based on our current findings and methodology,

1261
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:21,480
that we find no evidence to suggest that UAP are extraterrestrial in origin.

1262
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:24,480
I don't want to speculate on this too much. I'm just the messenger.

1263
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:27,480
For more information on this, you should watch this amazing interview

1264
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:29,480
that Eric Weinstein did on Joe Rogan.

1265
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:31,480
I'm linking it in the description.

1266
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:34,480
If I was going to locate a Manhattan project in plain sight

1267
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:40,480
and get U.S. News and World to report this as a minor player in research,

1268
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:42,480
that's where I'd go.

1269
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:45,480
You can't let the fox watch the hen house.

1270
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:50,480
And if you have an agency or a group within the Defense Department

1271
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:53,480
or the intelligence community running the show

1272
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:58,480
and allegedly investigating UFO activity at nuclear weapons sites,

1273
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:01,480
you're going to get nowhere quick. And that's the whole idea.

1274
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:04,480
Do you feel like your communications are being tracked?

1275
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:06,480
No question.

1276
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:11,480
Do you have any clear concrete examples that will show people that you're not being paranoid?

1277
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:16,480
I went out on the lecture circuit for the first time in September of 81

1278
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:22,480
and spoke at, I believe, 16 schools between September and the end of the year.

1279
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:26,480
And in my audiences at various schools around the country,

1280
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:30,480
veterans would come up to me and say, I know what you're talking about.

1281
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:32,480
I was involved this, that, and the other.

1282
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:35,480
I would say, can we talk about this on the phone?

1283
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:40,480
When I get off the lecture circuit, you know, I'll be home early next year, 82.

1284
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:43,480
And some said yes, some said no.

1285
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:48,480
But I did interview a handful of veterans from home over the phone

1286
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:51,480
and taped the conversations with their permission.

1287
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:54,480
In most cases, in some cases, they didn't want them taped.

1288
01:55:54,480 --> 01:56:00,480
But anyway, they were telling me about what they had witnessed at various missile bases through the years.

1289
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:07,480
And after each one of those calls, this was primarily in February of 82,

1290
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:12,480
I would talk to them, thank them, hang up the phone.

1291
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:15,480
Within a minute or five or ten, the phone would ring.

1292
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:19,480
I would pick it up, and there would be nothing but heavy breathing in the phone.

1293
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:21,480
That's creepy.

1294
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:29,480
Our government does not necessarily blink trying to turn your reputation into absolute garbage

1295
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:32,480
if you get close to its treasured sources and methods.

1296
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:40,480
And that is not compatible with saying that we have something that we don't understand,

1297
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:43,480
menacing our military, its airspace, and our nuclear sites.

1298
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:50,480
I stated to you that I would not have mentioned very much of it to anybody except my fellow missileers

1299
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:56,480
because I didn't want to get investigated by the Office of Special Investigations, sometimes known as OSI.

1300
01:56:56,480 --> 01:57:03,480
I did not want it to reflect on my officer efficiency report, the OER.

1301
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:11,480
It feels like in the past five to seven years, there's been a lot of vindication for your work

1302
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:18,480
and for people who are active in service to be confirming the things that you were telling the public

1303
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:20,480
in the late 90s and early 2000s.

1304
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:28,480
How does that feel to now see it, to see it blue on Joe Rogan showing Joe the Montana documents?

1305
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:41,480
I don't recall whether we discussed this yesterday, but in the New York Times article that came out in December of 2017,

1306
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:47,480
Leslie Kane, Ralph Blumenfall, that basically exposed ATIP to the world.

1307
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:52,480
In the article, they mentioned that ATIP's scientific advisor was Dr. Hal Puthoff.

1308
01:57:52,480 --> 01:58:02,480
And I was shocked because in 2005, I reached out to him to help me write a chapter in my book on faster-than-light travel.

1309
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:05,480
I knew that he had done a peer-reviewed paper on it.

1310
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:11,480
Then in 2008, when the first edition of UFOs and Nukes came out,

1311
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:17,480
he suddenly wrote to me and said, I need four copies of the book shipped overnight.

1312
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:20,480
I checked into it. It was going to be $115.

1313
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:25,480
I got back to him and said, what's the rush? That's a lot of money. Just let me send it media mail.

1314
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:32,480
He said, Robert, day after tomorrow, I have a meeting with some movers and shakers in Washington,

1315
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:34,480
and I'm going to distribute your book.

1316
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:39,480
This was December of 2008.

1317
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:45,480
What I didn't know until January of 2018, once the New York Times story came out,

1318
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:50,480
Hal had given copies of my book to the ATIP members, at least Lou.

1319
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:55,480
And it turns out Senator Harry Reid was given a copy.

1320
01:58:55,480 --> 01:59:04,480
Now, just last December of 23, George Knapp interviewed me for a Netflix documentary that's coming up,

1321
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:10,480
and before he started asking me questions, he said, are you aware that Harry Reid had read your book,

1322
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:15,480
and it was one of the reasons he had sought funding for OSAP?

1323
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:19,480
And I said, really? And he said, he told me that point blank.

1324
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:25,480
And there were a number of reasons that he felt that there had to be a new UFO investigation,

1325
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:33,480
but apparently the witness testimony contained in my book was one of the reasons that he decided that had to be done sooner rather than later.

1326
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:36,480
So that feels good to know. It feels good to know.

1327
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:39,480
That should be vindicating.

1328
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:47,480
I'm 74 years old, and it just seemed like decades have gone by where not much progress has been made in terms of public awareness.

1329
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:53,480
I mean, I've spoken at over 500 colleges and universities, so those people were in on my work.

1330
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:56,480
The local media who covered the program were in on my work.

1331
01:59:56,480 --> 02:00:00,480
But the national media for decades avoided me like the plague.

1332
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:04,480
I'd send press releases out. No one covered me at all.

1333
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:13,480
So finally, in just the last five years, I'm getting the sense that, hey, it was worth all the time and effort that I put into it.

1334
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:15,480
So yeah, it feels good.

1335
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:16,480
And it's interesting.

1336
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:22,480
We're going to get into some of the deeper roots as to how you got attracted to all the UFO stuff.

1337
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:30,480
But the nominal story and UFOs and nukes, at least, is that you're a janitor and your father was stationed at Malmstrom base in 67,

1338
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:34,480
and you were learning about radar theory and a radar operator calls you over.

1339
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:35,480
You see these unknowns.

1340
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:40,480
I think in many ways, Hal Puthoff has a similar story where he sort of stumbled upon the UFO stuff.

1341
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:43,480
He ran the CIA's psychic spy program.

1342
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:50,480
And I think a lot of these remote viewers would see beings in various places on the dark side of the moon,

1343
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:55,480
in Ingo Swann's case elsewhere, and Joseph McMonagle saw bases on Earth.

1344
02:00:55,480 --> 02:01:01,480
And I think that got him up to speed on, OK, maybe there's some other presences out here.

1345
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:04,480
He then joined, this is the part of the story people don't really know.

1346
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:09,480
He then joined something called the Advanced Theoretical Physics Group, ATP group.

1347
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:17,480
And it was him and Oki Shannon, who was a physics lead at Los Alamos, project lead there,

1348
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:23,480
John Alexander, who has a long history in this and I think is sort of maybe tied in with the DOE or something.

1349
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:28,480
And they're all sort of studying, and I think Eric Davis probably joined later,

1350
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:35,480
and they're all studying the physics of UFOs, like how would this stuff actually work theoretically?

1351
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:42,480
And I think Puthoff figured out a lot, and I think he's much deeper than people realize on the actual science of this stuff.

1352
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:49,480
Somewhere, well, I saw a video, and I think it was McMonagle?

1353
02:01:49,480 --> 02:01:50,480
Yes.

1354
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:55,480
Was called to the Pentagon one day and was told to go to this room.

1355
02:01:55,480 --> 02:02:00,480
And he goes in and he said it was like a broom closet, but it had a table in it, so he sat down.

1356
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:08,480
And if I remember the story correctly, someone came in and said, we want you to use remote viewing for this site.

1357
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:16,480
And the story is that he basically saw a UFO hovering over a nuclear missile, which I thought was pretty interesting.

1358
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:23,480
Joseph McMonagle, for people that don't know, has done more televised remote viewings than anybody in the world.

1359
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:33,480
He was known as remote viewer number one, and he was the most talented and most consistent psychic spy for the Stargate program.

1360
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:36,480
Also, talk about this stuff running in families.

1361
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:41,480
He happens to be the nephew of Robert Monroe, who was doing all sorts of consciousness studies,

1362
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:46,480
still has, in his namesake, the Monroe Center in Virginia named after him.

1363
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:51,480
And McMonagle lives in Faber, Virginia, right around there.

1364
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:58,480
And I remember being on the phone with Joseph McMonagle once, and he was saying, you know, yeah, it's crazy.

1365
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:03,480
You know, the E.T. stuff is definitely real. He was giving me all this interesting evidence and talking about the remote viewing stuff.

1366
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:07,480
And then he said something that I will never forget.

1367
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:13,480
He said that I think we might be turning into these E.T.s or something.

1368
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:17,480
They might be sort of prompting us to turn into some of them.

1369
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:24,480
I can't help but wonder if we're on the precipice of a massive revolution in human consciousness,

1370
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:32,480
where we either evolve there together or we bifurcate and still evolve there, but in a very different way.

1371
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:36,480
We will have our minds expanded. There will be a paradigm shift.

1372
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:45,480
Traditional institutions such as religions, governments, other social institutions may indeed be threatened by what is coming.

1373
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:49,480
That is just a logical consequence of what is about to occur.

1374
02:03:52,480 --> 02:04:01,480
I want to thank the legendary Robert Hastings for his multi-decade long, tireless dedication to telling the stories of these brave patriots

1375
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:08,480
who just want a broader surface on an ontological truth that is global, ubiquitous and should not be classified.

1376
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:15,480
But Hastings exists in a tradition of other researchers who have called out the UFO nuclear connection before him,

1377
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:20,480
some of whom will not see the vindication that Hastings will see in his lifetime.

1378
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:28,480
James McDonald was a physicist at Arizona State who, after seeing a UFO at Savannah Riverside Nuclear Facility in South Carolina,

1379
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:34,480
was made a public mockery of. Harry Turner was the head of the Australian nuclear program.

1380
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:43,480
He became very convinced in the UFO nuclear connection, writing candidly that he thought the Americans had gone much deeper on UFOs and antigravity

1381
02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:47,480
than the fake Air Force project Blue Book would have you believe.

1382
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:55,480
Turner was well acquainted with the UFO nuclear link due to many unusual occurrences in Australia's own atomic test range.

1383
02:04:55,480 --> 02:05:03,480
Turner suggested in a 1971 document that the Australian government invest more time and effort in UFO research.

1384
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:09,480
The government unfortunately did not listen to him. If you read Robert Hastings' book, he's not telling you what to think.

1385
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:14,480
He's not saying that we're definitely living in the plot of The Day the Earth Stood Still,

1386
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:19,480
that these beings are definitely trying to deter us from destroying the planet and ourselves,

1387
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:25,480
although he is partial to the Benevolent Protector theory a bit more than the Hostile Adversary theory.

1388
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:32,480
Hastings' main point is a scientific one, that we can't just throw out the testimony of almost 200 stand-up patriots

1389
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:39,480
who are screened for their mental health and say that they are seeing UFOs repeatedly showing up in sensitive American airspace.

1390
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:48,480
That's just bad science and bad thinking. But I will say our world is truly on the brink, and there's likely just a narrow path out.

1391
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:52,480
We can react to these nuclear link to UFO sightings in one of two ways.

1392
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:56,480
We can clamp down, or we can reach out.

1393
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:03,480
Perhaps the message that a 23-year-old Mario Woods got from the beings he encountered are the most relevant here.

1394
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:07,480
I kept hearing over and over, do not fear, do not fear.

1395
02:06:07,480 --> 02:06:11,480
What do you hope the world gets from your testimony?

1396
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:18,480
Understanding, perhaps, or the possibility of not to think that they're here to defeat us.

1397
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:21,480
Because if they were, we wouldn't be having this conversation right now.

1398
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:23,480
Can you talk to me?

1399
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:26,480
Can you hear me?

1400
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:30,480
God is good.

1401
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:36,480
God is good.

1402
02:06:37,480 --> 02:06:39,480
God is good.

1403
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:48,480
This story, like most, is stranger than you could ever imagine.

1404
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:51,480
I wish it were simpler, and I wish this were the end of it.

1405
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:55,480
But in our next episode with Robert Hastings, we're going to go one level deeper.

1406
02:06:55,480 --> 02:07:09,480
I always cite you when I speak to UFO skeptics because, as evidenced by this interview, you don't miss a name, a date, the setup of all these Air Force bases and nuclear sites.

1407
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:13,480
And so I cite you to skeptics who need that level of rigor.

1408
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:17,480
They need this repeatable thing in the form of a nuclear connection.

1409
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:25,480
And so I think it is incredibly courageous that you've written a second book, and it's called Confession.

1410
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:33,480
And it's really a revelation around what you've experienced personally around the phenomena.

1411
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:39,480
And it feels like you were maybe worried about putting this out very reasonably because you thought it would hurt your credibility.

1412
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:46,480
You have had some of your own experiences with these entities and their crafts. Is that right?

1413
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:51,480
I have.
