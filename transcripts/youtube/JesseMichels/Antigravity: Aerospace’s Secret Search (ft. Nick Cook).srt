1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
If I'm being shown this and I'm imagining that,

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,440
what actually is out there that I'm not even beginning to imagine?

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,440
The year is 1994.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,800
Nick Cook, the aviation editor for Jane's Defense Weekly,

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,560
walks into his office and notices someone has placed a photocopy

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,720
of a strange magazine article from 1956 on his desk.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,760
What it showed was a sort of look like a UFO,

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,360
kind of with a ladder coming out of it over a dry lake bed,

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,480
and an Air Force pilot climbing out of this thing.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,720
It's titled The G-Engines Are Coming,

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,320
and it lists the top aerospace companies of the day.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,360
Lear, Convair, Bell, the Martin Corporation,

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,120
before its merger with Lockheed,

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,200
all expressing extreme confidence in being able to develop

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,960
anti-gravity aircraft within the next several years.

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,720
One of the people quoted is George S. Trimble,

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,520
the VP of Martin Corporation's Research Institute for Advanced Study.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,000
He says that human control of gravity could be done

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,120
in about the time it took to build the first atom bomb.

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,480
But by the early 1960s, there were no G-Engines,

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,200
no weightless craft or man-made UFOs,

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,720
and the whole industry kind of went silent on the subject.

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:24,960
And I filed it away until I ran into a Lockheed PR exec

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,240
I knew pretty well.

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,800
And I said I'd like to interview George Trimble

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,200
because it just sounded intriguing.

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,160
The old VP initially seemed open to the interview,

28
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,000
but a few days later, Nick got a call from his Lockheed contact

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
who relayed a message from Trimble.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,200
He doesn't want to speak to me, and he doesn't want to speak to you.

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,960
Not now, not ever.

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,520
I don't mind telling you that he sounded scared.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,280
It is that moment when you go,

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,840
OK, well, if I wasn't interested before, I am now.

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,340
Yeah.

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,320
That's Nick Cooke, and those were real-life moments

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,120
from his incredible book, The Hunt for Zero Point.

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,400
The book is the most comprehensive documentation to date

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,240
of aerospace's formerly unknown, yet very deep inquiries

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,920
into the world of antigravity.

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,720
You're looking at something that is a complete quantum leap.

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,920
If you're making something that is some sort of a gravity propulsion system

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,600
and you've made a breakthrough,

44
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,160
you're not going to put that on WIRED.com.

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,640
Nick isn't a woo-woo UFO nerd.

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,680
He spent decades as a correspondent and then editor

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,840
for the prestigious British military publication, Jane's Defense Weekly.

48
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,040
Entrusted at the highest levels, he traveled the world

49
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,080
and interviewed executives at Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Raytheon, and many others.

50
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,600
I had a pretty much unlimited kind of travel budget attached to me.

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,400
It was a global brief. I could go anywhere.

52
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,200
And in the 80s and 90s, Cooke began hunting down what he wasn't being shown.

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Classified stealth and supersonic aircraft in the Black World

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
that hadn't reached the public.

55
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,520
He did this along with his colleague, Bill Sweetman.

56
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,400
Bill was a kind of Sherlock Holmes.

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,440
He would piece together clues that the Black World left

58
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,800
or hadn't even intended to leave in public.

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,880
Most notably, they've uncovered some pretty strong circumstantial evidence

60
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,640
of the long-rumored Mach 5 Lockheed Aurora aircraft.

61
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,160
But more on that later.

62
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,360
I always felt like I'm just scratching the surface of what's really going on here.

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,080
I can seriously say with a straight face that The Hunt for Zero Point

64
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,480
is one of my favorite books of all time and one of the most important books

65
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,240
in considering all of the possibilities of the UFO mystery.

66
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,600
That some of these UFOs may actually be man-made.

67
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,520
He ended his talk with a slide of a black disc zipping off into outer space.

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
And he ended it with these words.

69
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,080
We now have the technology to take E.T. home.

70
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,800
In this exclusive interview, we retrace Nick's sensational journey

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,560
in The Hunt for Zero Point.

72
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
From Skunk Works to Nazi Germany,

73
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,840
which had its own reported anti-gravity programs under SS officer Hans Komler.

74
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,280
Programs that were scavenged for their most valuable technology

75
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,720
by the Americans and the Russians at the end of World War II.

76
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
There may have been stuff going on in World War II

77
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,560
that we just don't know about to this day.

78
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,120
And along the way, Cook chronicles the motley crew of forgotten inventors

79
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,640
and academics who reported anti-gravitational effects.

80
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,800
Victor Schauberger, Thomas Townsend Brown, John Hutchinson,

81
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
Eugene Kletnoff, and many others.

82
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,840
Cook even interviewed Ning Li,

83
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,400
the mysterious Chinese-American physicist who was awarded a DOD grant

84
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,600
for her anomalous anti-gravity research results at University of Alabama Huntsville.

85
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,200
And then I don't know sort of how soon after that it was that she sort of went off grid.

86
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,880
Certainly probably about within a year that she just disappeared.

87
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,800
And no one knew what had happened to her.

88
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,400
And if that's not crazy enough, Cook and I also explore

89
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,880
aerospace's long-standing interest in mind over matter effects.

90
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,760
Or the fringy field of parapsychology.

91
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,320
Is there a through line with aerospace and like this interest in mind over matter?

92
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,640
These companies look at anything they can that can confer possible advantage.

93
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,720
So without further ado, sit back, relax,

94
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,920
and prepare to have your brain absolutely broken by today's British alchemist, Nick Cook.

95
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:43,280
I'm here with the author of one of my favorite books of all time, Nick Cook.

96
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,720
We're here to talk about his book, The Hunt for Zero Point.

97
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,800
I chose as our background, by the way, an Avrocar in 1961 in a NASA wind tunnel.

98
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,160
And I know the Avrocar kind of nominally at least went nowhere,

99
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,320
but I did find it to be kind of an iconic, interesting photo.

100
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,520
Yeah, it looks an awful lot sort of sexier there than actually the poor thing turned out to be.

101
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,080
It really was a bit of a dog of a machine, but we can talk about that.

102
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,680
Yeah, yeah. Well, let's get into it.

103
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,840
So I want to get into, I think in some ways your autobiographical story when it comes to

104
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,200
this journey is really important for people to understand because you don't seem like one of

105
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:30,800
these UFO nut Cooks or even particularly into very out there stuff kind of a priori.

106
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,960
And so you were an aviation journalist at Jane's Defense Weekly, right?

107
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,760
And then what got you into aviation in the first place?

108
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,680
That's a really good question.

109
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,160
So I did a completely unrelated degree at university, which was Arabic and Islamic studies.

110
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,480
But then I got to the end of university and I realized that the thing I was really interested

111
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:59,120
in was aerospace and engineering, but I didn't want to go and do another three years of engineering.

112
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,520
Plus, I wasn't particularly great at maths.

113
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,720
It was my dad, actually, who was an engineer who said to me,

114
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,280
why don't you write about it? Why don't you write about aerospace?

115
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,160
That had never occurred to me until that moment.

116
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,480
But actually, when he said that, I sort of light bulb went on.

117
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,560
And I knew that that was what I was going to do.

118
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,640
So let's talk about your introduction into aerospace's inquiries into anti gravity,

119
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,560
because I find that story very interesting.

120
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,680
There was an article that showed up on your desk. Is that right?

121
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,240
Yeah, there was an article that showed up on my desk.

122
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,200
I mean, people would send stuff to us at Jane's.

123
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,040
We had a central mail opening facility.

124
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,400
So I never knew who sent it to me. It might have been anonymously sent.

125
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:47,680
And I was about to throw it in the trash when I started to sort of read it.

126
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,080
And there were these company names that I recognized.

127
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,120
It was still familiar, like Convair, General Dynamics,

128
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Lockheed, Lear.

129
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,680
And it said, there's real activity going on.

130
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,200
Lots of scientists are involved.

131
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,360
And we anticipate a breakthrough by the early 1960s,

132
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,320
by which time we're all going to be flying around like the Jessens.

133
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,000
And there's a George Trimble is the VP of Martin Corporation, pre-Lockheed merger.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,760
Their group called RIAS, which is studying anti gravity at the time,

135
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,640
says this could be done in about the amount of time it took to build the first atom bomb.

136
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,160
And so you get this sort of like, you know, it's around the bend feel.

137
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,480
Correct. And in my mind's eye, I had an image of the bomb program

138
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,320
as a kind of progenitor for this.

139
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,600
You know, this was the kind of time scales,

140
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,240
probably the kind of money that was being going to be thrown at this.

141
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,440
And the architecture that would be employed,

142
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,760
except that it seemed it was all, of course, being talked about openly then.

143
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,240
And I filed it away intrigued, but, you know,

144
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:07,040
I've got real stuff to be getting on with until I ran into a Lockheed PR exec I knew pretty well.

145
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,000
And I said I'd like to interview George Trimble because it just sounded intriguing.

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,320
And I think I'd found out that Trimble was still alive,

147
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,920
or maybe I'd asked this person to find out if Trimble was still alive.

148
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,680
Anyway, the answer came back that Trimble didn't want to speak to me.

149
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,680
And he was really quite spooked at the idea of speaking to me.

150
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,120
And I was politely sort of invited to drop this interest.

151
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,280
But he seemed open to initially speaking to you.

152
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,920
And then he goes back and he says, you know, I don't know who this man is,

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,080
but I won't speak to him now or ever.

154
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,400
And I suggest you drop it, you know, something like that.

155
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,600
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

156
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,920
And so what caused this sort of 180 flip?

157
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,040
What caused the 180 flip?

158
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
I have no idea.

159
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,080
Like I say, it could have been, oh, my God,

160
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,240
there's something really secret there that I, George Trimble, you know,

161
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,760
inadvertently stumbled, you know, I sort of re stumbled over

162
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,040
because I was once told never to talk about it.

163
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,040
Or it could have been the prosaic version, you know, which is it's just

164
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,400
this is not something we talk about in polite company in the 1990s anymore.

165
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,880
OK, so the door gets shut in your face.

166
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,400
And of course, as a journalist, that makes you more interested.

167
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,360
Yeah, it is that moment when you go, OK, well, if I wasn't interested before, I am now.

168
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,680
Yeah. And then what what did you encounter next in your anti-gravity journey?

169
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,640
Well, what I did was I did that thing

170
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:53,520
that you and how had that very interesting discussion with Eric Weinstein about,

171
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,960
which was the physics piece.

172
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,280
It would only be if it were the case that in fact, we have mastered

173
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,960
anti-gravity and they're being built by aerospace corporations,

174
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,160
then new physics would have to be involved.

175
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,560
I did look at the piece that Eric Weinstein referenced,

176
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,880
which was all the sort of physics that was going on at the time.

177
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,200
And he did that brilliantly.

178
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,840
My understanding is that they were really twin loci of activity.

179
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,880
Babson contacted Lewis Whitten, who was coming out of Johns Hopkins.

180
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:36,960
And then oddly, a similarly named individual named Bainson reaches out to Bryce DeWitt

181
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:43,120
and asks whether he will found an institute at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

182
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,880
And then there's a famous gravity conference at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill

183
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
that sort of kicks a lot of this off.

184
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,640
It's a tremendous flurry of activity at a time when anti-gravity

185
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,200
was trying to break into respectability.

186
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,720
I couldn't get the trail that far, but I realized that there was

187
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,720
there was a big physics trail to this story.

188
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,800
But I decided that I was going to pursue it sort of chronologically.

189
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,960
And of course, when you're talking about anti-gravity,

190
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,840
you're talking about something that is a UFO that looks probably like a flying saucer.

191
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:27,120
So I start to do my due diligence, which is I look at the first sightings of this kind of shape.

192
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:36,880
The tic-tac of today was the flying butane tank of the 1950s.

193
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,400
And you can find declassified Air Force OSI reports that are publicly searchable right now

194
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,960
to talk about these like flying white butane tanks.

195
00:12:45,120 --> 00:13:00,720
In 1947, General Nathan Twining, who's the head of the Air Materiel Command responsible

196
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,840
for all aircraft development in the Air Force, writes a famous memo called the Twining Memo.

197
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,120
UFO nuts love to talk about this memo because he says UFOs are not visionary or fictitious.

198
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,360
I think the coolest update on the Twining Memo comes from your book because you notice

199
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,520
some things in the postscript of the memo that are perhaps even more intriguing than

200
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,120
just top Air Force brass conceding the reality of UFOs.

201
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,520
Yeah, in the memo, Twining states in his Considered Opinion quotes that the rash

202
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,400
of UFO sightings in America during the summer of 1947, the first real wave, as it turned out,

203
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,840
had been something real and not visionary or fictitious. He continued,

204
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:44,960
There are objects approximating the shape of a disk of such appreciable size as to appear to be

205
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:51,280
as large as a man-made aircraft. These disks exhibited a number of common characteristics

206
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,520
amongst them, a metallic or light-reflecting surface, an absence of any jet trail,

207
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,760
and no propulsion sound.

208
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:05,440
And he talks about some observables of UFOs in his day, extreme rates of climb maneuverability,

209
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,360
no vapor trails, which would imply a novel form of propulsion. And then he says in the postscript,

210
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,240
it is within our present knowledge to build these sorts of crafts. And then with a range

211
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,800
that, you know, I think the U-2 spy plane hadn't even come out yet. It was like, you know,

212
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,960
seven years or something in the future, it would come out. And on its best day,

213
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,080
I think the U-2 couldn't meet the range of the aircraft that he described at subsonic speed.

214
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:42,560
It's basically saying they're real, but we don't know how they're flying.

215
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,360
So coming out of World War II, there may have been stuff going on in World War II

216
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,960
that we just don't know about to this day.

217
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,320
That's a perfect segue because from 42 to 45, you have allied and Axis fighter pilots

218
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,000
seeing these sort of seemingly controlled ball lightning things. They call them the

219
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,960
Foo Fighters after the Smokey Stover comic strip. And then in 46, you also have Swedish

220
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:18,560
ghost rockets. And I think it was, you know, so on the radar of top military personnel in the US

221
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,360
that Eisenhower actually sends General James Doolittle to go out and investigate these sort of

222
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,240
seemingly, it looks like modified versions of V-2 rockets that are flying at, you know,

223
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,200
speeds and with propulsion that we could never dream of. And so you then go into it and kind

224
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:41,760
of investigate this kind of European possible origination of these saucers.

225
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,360
Yeah. There are lots of references to Foo Fighters and technologies which are really

226
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:54,160
advanced. You know, like there was one I seem to remember called, the German name was Windhund.

227
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:03,360
So Wind Dog. It was for sniffing the air streams behind, left behind bombers in the trail of

228
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,080
bombers so that you could follow a bomber stream from detection of their exhaust trail.

229
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,480
And then as I say, I think in the hunt, there are a bunch of technologies that you could package

230
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,440
together that could go into a Foo Fighter. But you know, even doing that today would be challenging.

231
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,160
I mean, really challenging actually. But yet, you still have the sightings evidence from

232
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,400
allied pilots, you know, a lot saying that they saw stuff. So how do you square that circle? Well,

233
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,200
you can't. But you find a lot of interesting circumstantial evidence around the existence

234
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:48,240
possibly of a secret weapons program under SS officer Hans Kammler called Skoda Works.

235
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,040
Yeah, I don't even think that's circumstantial. I think there's very good evidence to show that

236
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:01,040
his, what was called the Kammler, he called the Kammler Stab, which was the Kammler staff. It was

237
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:08,080
basically a special projects office run by SS General Hans Kammler in the latter part of the war

238
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:14,240
for secret projects. I mean, breakthrough technology. The V2 was put under his control,

239
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,720
I think until the hunt, you know, very little was known about him. So I thought that that

240
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,880
was a trail worth following. And it took me to some quite interesting places.

241
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:34,480
Hans Kammler was a high ranking Nazi SS officer who oversaw the construction of several concentration

242
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,800
camps, including the notorious Auschwitz Birkenau. He was deeply committed to Nazi ideology and

243
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,880
became one of Hitler's most trusted officers in the last years of the Third Reich. That is,

244
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,240
until Kammler turned on Hitler. By 1945, Kammler, who was already in charge of the Nazi's most

245
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,080
deadly suite of weapons, had a secret plan to assassinate the Fuhrer. Kammler's colleague and

246
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,640
fellow Nazi Albert Speer once said of him,

247
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,080
As Cook writes,

248
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,160
Kammler and his staff presided over the blackest of black Nazi secret weapons projects in modern

249
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,240
Czechoslovakia and Poland. The rumors around Kammler's work take the concept of Wunderwaffe

250
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,520
or wonder weapons to the next level. There are sort of six different accounts of his death,

251
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,080
which is always suspicion. There was quite a bit of evidence that Kammler had been in

252
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:45,040
negotiations with the Western allies before the end of the war. And of course, the deal was

253
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,920
the obvious one, which is you get all my files on all the technologies that I've been in charge of

254
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,440
and you let me live. Kammler oversaw V weapons, rockets, remote control aircraft, atomic energy,

255
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,560
jet propulsion, and other similar subjects. And there are many who believe that flying saucer

256
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,320
shaped craft were a part of his mandate as well. Kammler recruited Rudolf Schreiber,

257
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,360
a German technician who claims to have worked on a disc shaped craft in Prague

258
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,840
that made its first test flight in February of 1945, climbing to 40,000 feet in three minutes.

259
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,000
Kammler also recruited Victor Schauberger. Schauberger was a naturalist in every sense.

260
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,880
Not only was he a forester, but he held true to the maxim that science should comprehend

261
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,640
and copy nature. His ideas resemble what we now call free energy or zero point energy,

262
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,080
energy taken from the vacuum or ether. There's enough energy in the volume of a coffee cup to

263
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,560
evaporate all the world's oceans if you could get it all of it. Schauberger had his own diagrams

264
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,080
and designs for a flying saucer with what became known as an impeller engine. You know, there are

265
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,520
some sort of pretty arcane stories about things that Schauberger had built that purportedly took

266
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:09,200
off, that he was running air through at very high rotation speeds, he was running water through at

267
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,760
very high rotation speeds. After leaving his home in Austria abruptly in 1942, the year Kammler's

268
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,160
secret projects began, Schauberger wrote to his son that he was in Jablonec in Czechoslovakia

269
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,200
and that what I am doing is secret. I was able to go and visit the Schauberger family

270
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,920
and they opened up their files, the family files, and in particular they show me

271
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,120
Victor's diary from that time. All the places he's going to on a trail he says he can't talk about

272
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:48,720
are all places which I'd already mapped in the Kammler kingdom. These are secret

273
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,000
laboratories and outposts and underground facilities that Kammler had built to develop

274
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,560
his special weaponry. Finally, alongside them you had the famed Richard Mita, who also had designs

275
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,640
for a flying saucer. Mita worked in high-voltage physics. As further evidence that Hans Kammler

276
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,560
was working on building real flying saucers, John Warner IV has a story he likes to tell about his

277
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:19,120
grandfather, Paul Mellon, one of the founders of the CIA. Mellon was in Czechoslovakia on a top

278
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,920
secret trip at the end of World War II, along with his colleague who went on to become the

279
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,680
third director of the CIA, Alan Dulles, and this is what he told his grandson. And my grandfather

280
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,520
said look you know we we were in a facility, a hangar, and we saw you know a German flying disc

281
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:42,800
and I said you know oh is that the one that was cobbled together with six BMW jet engines

282
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,600
and he laughed and he said no.

283
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:55,440
Maybe the craziest rumor around Škoda Works is this idea of deglaca, this sort of bell that at

284
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,520
the time it was rumored to have a sort of torsion field and created kind of time dilation effects

285
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,560
on the inside of the bell and you'd put a human in there and you know it'd be kind of as if time

286
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,720
travel because time would slow on the inside it would run at a normal pace on the outside you'd

287
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,880
walk out you'd be a thousand years in the future and you had reportedly you know Ernest Grauitz

288
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,320
who's the head of the SS Medical Division under which Joseph Mengele worked and a guy named Walter

289
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:29,440
Gerlach who's you know a prominent German physicist who explored gravity a bit before you know working

290
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,160
maybe on this this sort of exotic crazy project. Do you have any reason to believe that this existed?

291
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:46,320
Well you know I have to hold my hands up and say that the bell or the deglaca story wasn't really

292
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,240
my story you know I have to hand and I do hand in the book credit for that to a guy called Igor

293
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:59,920
Witkowski who was is a Polish writer story and writes about German secret weapons stuff. I get

294
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,760
this connection with Igor Witkowski who tells me all about the bell story which is you know it's

295
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:12,080
purportedly about this device that produces some kind of weird time dilation effect an

296
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:20,560
anti-gravitational effect and I pay this very atmospheric visit with Igor to the site where

297
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:28,240
supposedly it was installed which was deep in a mine in a place called Waldenburg in what is now

298
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,920
southern Poland and there of course there was this thing that sort of hexagonal thing that he

299
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:42,480
said was evidence of a test rig for some kind of you know disc-shaped craft.

300
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,360
When you go on the ground you can see that this was a very secret installation of some kind you

301
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:58,720
can still see evidence of very thick cabling lots of electricity into this place so you know what

302
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,760
else could it have been? I mean over time I have come to conclude that it was probably a one of

303
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:13,920
several sites that the Germans the SS in particular were using to look into nuclear weapons nuclear

304
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:19,840
technology beyond the Heisenberg program which was the one that everyone knows stopped in I think it

305
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,760
was 42 or 43. One of your sources later in the hunt for zero point does say that you know there's

306
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,960
some sort of it was called Kronos or something was he referring to deglock or was it another program?

307
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:40,240
No no I think it I think it was Witkowski himself who said that it was called Kronos and of course

308
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:49,600
that is the Greek for what the Greek god Kronos who ruled over time and in a sense

309
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,800
over reality as well so you know if that was its name it was it could have been aptly named.

310
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,000
Let's go back to that Michael Gladitch article the G engines are coming in it he talks about

311
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,400
G particles or gravity particles these gravitons would theoretically mediate the force of gravity

312
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,080
much like photons mediate electromagnetism. Gladitch cites Stanley Desser and Richard

313
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,840
Arnowit at Princeton as being actively involved in this research. The pair wrote a paper about

314
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,920
these theoretical gravitons in their 1954 winning essay for the Gravity Research Foundation. Yes

315
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,680
there was a gravity essay contest involving the top theoretical physicists in the world at the time

316
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:40,000
this shows just how bizarrely in vogue the study of gravity was in the 50s as mathematician Louis

317
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,720
Witten would say. Anti-gravity was in the wind this could mean one of two things number one that

318
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,400
it was ubiquitous it was in the zeitgeist and sort of everywhere but the second possible meaning is

319
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,160
that maybe it was still everywhere but it was scattered and obfuscated and hard to detect at

320
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:05,120
the same time. In the wind is a famous term used by spies and intelligence when they go off grid.

321
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:12,640
In fact there's a 1971 Australian intelligence memo cited by David Grush and others that points

322
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:19,760
to this deep yet hidden American interest in anti-gravity in the 50s. It was written by Harry

323
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,040
Turner the head of the Australian Joint Intelligence Organization's nuclear division. The Joint

324
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,280
Intelligence Organization, JIO, was basically Australia's CIA. The Aussies had nuclear testing

325
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,960
facilities run by Turner that had experienced some bizarre UFO encounters and so they were

326
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,480
starting to believe that American inquiries into UFOs and anti-gravity were far deeper than the

327
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,840
public facing American programs like Operation Blue Book that were systematically downplaying

328
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,600
and marginalizing the topic. Project Blue Book was the best I could do at the time because I felt

329
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,960
they had a real project going on that was secret. Is that true? And the Air Force did. Oh I didn't

330
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:08,800
know that. This 1971 Australian intelligence memo makes some bombshell claims. It lists all

331
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,560
of the same top aerospace companies in Gladitch's article that Cook found as being actively involved

332
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:21,920
in gravity research. Martin Corporation, Lear, Convair, Bell. But it also lists top physicists

333
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:28,800
you have all heard of. Even Robert J. Oppenheimer as being actively and deeply involved in anti-gravity

334
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:34,480
research. Finally it lists six top academic institutions as being the center of gravity

335
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,400
research in the U.S. Princeton, Institute for Advanced Study, and University of North Carolina

336
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,880
Chapel Hill. All doing gravity research at the behest of the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence.

337
00:27:46,880 --> 00:28:01,600
Agnew Bonson was the patron of the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill's anti-gravity outpost

338
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:07,360
called the Institute for Field Physics. He was an industrialist obsessed with anti-gravity,

339
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:14,160
and in 1957 he held the Chapel Hill Conference to discuss gravity in the Einsteinian paradigm,

340
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:21,040
kicking off an era from 1957 to 1970 in which general relativity moved from a novel curiosity

341
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:29,040
to the centerpiece of modern physics. This era is now known as the Golden Age of Relativity.

342
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,720
In this conference Bonson convenes many of the top physicists in the world. John Wheeler, Richard

343
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,520
Feynman, and Freeman Dyson. And the whole conference was sponsored by Wright Airfield,

344
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,040
the center of all UFO rumors, who had its own theoretical physics anti-gravity division

345
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,040
under Syracuse Ph.D. Josh Goldberg. Lewis Whitten was at the Chapel Hill Conference too.

346
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,240
And where was Lewis Whitten working on gravity? At none other than George Trimble's special

347
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,040
research division at Martin Corporation, the Research Institute for Advanced Study.

348
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,240
He also was studying anti-gravity for Wright Airfield. The reason there was a laboratory

349
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,720
at Wright Field was to find out what we were doing and to help us do it. And I got a contract

350
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:21,280
from Wright Field to do it, to do gravity, which I did very happily. So with all of the money and

351
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,280
resources funneling into gravity research in the 50s, and all of the time that's elapsed since,

352
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,040
are we really supposed to believe that we've made no progress on the topic?

353
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,120
Maybe. Who knows? But to frame things slightly differently,

354
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,000
if we have made any progress on anti-gravity, but that progress got turned into special access

355
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
programs or was militarized, it might look like we haven't made any progress. You'd never be able

356
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,520
to tell the difference. Maybe a hint lies with Agnew Bonson of the Institute of Field Physics.

357
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,200
The anti-gravity obsessed patron wrote a science fiction book before his untimely death in a plane

358
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,600
crash. It was called The Stars Are Too High, and it involves a team of rogue Nazi scientists who

359
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,440
were captured and moved to America after the war, culminating in a collaboration to build man-made

360
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,920
flying saucers utilizing anti-gravity. The makers of these saucers hatch up a plan to fake an alien

361
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,080
invasion in order to quell tensions between the Russians and the United States.

362
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:38,880
And then I go to, as you say, I go to Townsend Brown, who was, as you've ably covered in a

363
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,240
previous film, an inventor. He had some connection to Lockheed.

364
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,840
In one of my recent videos, the man who built UFOs for the CIA,

365
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,160
we cover the life of the most interesting man you've probably never heard of,

366
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,920
Thomas Townsend Brown. Brown was a mid-century engineer and inventor whose life is shrouded

367
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,200
in mystery and rife with controversy. Some people believe he made vital discoveries

368
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,200
in the world of anti-gravity, while others think he was an amateur quack.

369
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,320
One piece of blowback I got after making that documentary was the proposition that Brown's

370
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,320
work could have made it into the B-2 stealth bomber. For a while I looked at whether the B-2

371
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,200
bomber might have employed some kind of Townsend Brown type techniques to make it a little

372
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:36,800
stealthier, make it a little less prone to drag. Those are both byproducts of electrostatics. You

373
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,280
charge something electrostatically and you reduce its radar signature. That's useful for a stealth

374
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:48,320
bomber. You charge it electrostatically and you might reduce its drag. There were papers written

375
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,400
by the aerospace industry on that in the early 1960s by Northrop, I seem to remember.

376
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,440
Papers that were pulled, that you had a source, an anonymous source out here that noticed that

377
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,200
they were pulled from the AIAA's records. As far as I know, at that time they were.

378
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,040
As I say in my video, I can't definitively say that Brown's work made it into the B-2,

379
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:18,880
but I'll just lay out the facts and you decide. Townsend Brown met with Edward Teller in 1965,

380
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,480
who by many accounts, including this 1971 Australian intelligence memo, was working on

381
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,400
anti-gravity research since the 50s. At his Berkeley home, Teller is shown a demo by Brown

382
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,320
of his fan precipitator. This freaks Teller out so much that he turns to his wife and says,

383
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,680
I don't know how this works. Townsend Brown's daughter, Linda, who is still alive, was present

384
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:53,360
at that meeting and confirmed this account. A prominent aerospace investor and lawyer named

385
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,800
Floyd Odom gets tipped off about Teller's astonishment and decides to become the sole

386
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:05,120
investor in Brown's Santa Monica-based company, Guidance Technologies. Odom also happens to be a

387
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,640
majority owner of Northrop before its merger with Grumman. While at Guidance Technologies,

388
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,600
Brown continues his anti-gravity work on electrostatics. While conducting this work,

389
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,200
he's meeting with Bill Lear, former Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay, the RAND Corporation,

390
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,520
and other titans of aerospace. In the fall of 1967, Brown shuts the company down with no

391
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:34,560
explanation, saying he got no results. But in the winter of 1968, just three months after Brown shuts

392
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:41,040
down Guidance Technologies, Northrop, who has the same investor as Brown, Floyd Odom, happens to

393
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,280
publish a paper on electro aerodynamics and electro-gravitics and its implications for aviation.

394
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:53,280
Electro-gravitics is only used to describe one thing at the time, and it's Townsend Brown's work.

395
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:59,680
Did Brown shut down Guidance Technologies just to have his IP covertly transferred to Northrop Grumman,

396
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:05,840
his sole investor's biggest interest? Well, two decades later, when Northrop's B-2 stealth bomber

397
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,760
is revealed to the world, Aviation Weekly says it used an electrokinetic effect in its wings,

398
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,080
producing a bi-field Brown effect. The B-2 surfs its own electrostatic wave, the negative cloud

399
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,520
chasing the positive wing. And not to mention, Brown's wife, Josephine, received checks from

400
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,760
Odom for the rest of her life.

401
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:37,280
Mr. Odom did force them to sign a contract with my dad that was open-ended. It was something like

402
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:45,360
$2,500 a month. After daddy died, it was what put my mother going at $2,500.

403
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,860
Wow.

404
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,280
Never could. And I had to thank Odom for that.

405
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,280
But there are other, conventional, prominent journalists who believe that Brown's work made

406
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,600
it into the B-2 stealth bomber. I do cite in the book Bill Gunston, who was another Jane's editor,

407
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:08,000
and Bill Gunston was kind of like the doyen of aerospace, just a very dogged data guy.

408
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:17,920
And he comes up with a story saying that the B-2's performance data does not add up.

409
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,360
Given the power of its engines, it shouldn't be able to take off. So what's going on?

410
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,960
A lot of us thought, well, for you to say that, Bill, that's weird. That's odd.

411
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,880
That's odd. And he adds this kind of epithet, like, well, I think I'm going to draw the line

412
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,640
under this story because I don't want to end up in the Tower of London, aka a deep dark prison

413
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,360
that once was.

414
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,000
He says, I've long been familiar with the rudiments of Townsend Brown's work,

415
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,560
but I don't want to reside in the Tower of London. So I will refrain from speaking about

416
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,840
leading edges of millions of volts positive, followed by trailing edges of millions of

417
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,920
volts negative, which is a description, of course, of Townsend Brown's kind of capacitor work.

418
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:15,920
Some even think that B-2 was named after Byfield Brown. B-2, two B's, Byfield Brown.

419
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,760
So what do you think? And why is this even important if it were true?

420
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,800
Because if Brown's work made it into the B-2, then it means his work touched reality.

421
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,440
That means some of his other more exotic antigravity experiments, which also involved

422
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,800
many credible witnesses, all of whom I mentioned in my documentary, may have been valid, too.

423
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,160
It at least makes that more probable and quickly dispels the popular image of Townsend Brown,

424
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,040
that he was an amateur quack who never got anywhere.

425
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:55,680
I always liked your book because it was kind of a, it was very skeptical. It was just hardheaded.

426
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,800
And it was so, you had all this epistemic humility, like you were a real journalist

427
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,720
in a world of quacky woo woo, you know, looking for meaning types of people.

428
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,720
And so I go in, you know, reading the book, and I'm like, you know, to the Shotskin book,

429
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,200
and I'm like, you know, is there anything here? And honestly, the stuff that made me

430
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,280
higher conviction in Brown, it's not only these sort of threads we've pieced together in aerospace,

431
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,920
but it's like the way he communicated with his family about a lot of this stuff,

432
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,880
where it's like, I don't think he's psy-opping them. You know, that just fascinated me.

433
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,640
And it felt like it almost beget an expanded worldview.

434
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:40,000
I mean, what is interesting about Brown, you know, is his involvement

435
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,080
supposedly in the Philadelphia experiment, you know, about a disappearing warship and

436
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,800
time travel and all of that. And you think, where did that come from and why?

437
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,600
The Philadelphia experiment was a long rumored supposed Navy experiment in 1943 that turned the

438
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:03,680
USS Eldridge invisible and teleported it from Philadelphia to Norfolk, Virginia.

439
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,360
It spawned a book, a movie, and all sorts of crazy time travel and teleportation mythology.

440
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,840
I think the lore around this experiment is mostly total quackery and a bit insane.

441
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,280
And the experiment likely just involved a high voltage envelope created around the ship in order

442
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,720
to render it undetectable, scrambling its magnetic signature to avoid underwater mines,

443
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,760
torpedoes, and radar. That account is also backed up by Edward Dudgeon,

444
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,240
a Navy electrician that corresponded with legendary French UFO researcher Jacques

445
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,280
Bellay in the nineties. But Townsend Brown likely was involved in the experiment. In fact,

446
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,040
he was stationed at Norfolk, Virginia at the time. He also told his friend Josh Reynolds late in life

447
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,320
that the Philadelphia experiment did happen, its events were just greatly exaggerated.

448
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,880
This also explains the 1943 FBI file on Brown saying that he knew more about radar than anyone

449
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,920
in the Navy at the time. As we all know, the best kind of disinformation always has a little bit

450
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,840
of truth seated in there somewhere. So what on earth was going on there? You know, there could

451
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:14,320
have been a breakthrough there. There could have been. People say secrets don't keep that long.

452
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,440
Well, you know, I've already talked about a couple I know of that kept for 35 to 40 years.

453
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,920
The answer is they do keep for a long time. They can do. And particularly when you put

454
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,360
in special measures, you know, the disinfo stuff around them.

455
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:42,560
From there, I went to some white world lab test experiments which were going on in NASA at the

456
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:49,280
time. NASA had exhibited weirdly an interest in anti-gravity in the sort of mid 1990s,

457
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,360
following reports that a guy, he was a Russian called Yevgeny Podklepnov, who'd been working

458
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:02,560
out of the University of Tampere in Finland, had noticed a weight loss effect in objects suspended

459
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,040
above very rapidly rotating superconductors. So NASA wanted to replicate that. And to the best

460
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:18,560
of my knowledge, they were never able to. And from there, it just kind of snowballed.

461
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:26,240
The final thread here is this woman named Ning Li, who is in Alabama, and she's working on

462
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,400
anti-gravity experiments. And you actually interviewed her, right? She's been brought up

463
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,000
actually in the context of by Joe Rogan and some other podcasters very recently because

464
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,400
she has this bizarre disappearance. There's a story about this Chinese scientist

465
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,600
that was working on anti-gravity and then vanished.

466
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,960
Ning Li was a Chinese-American physicist who's experiencing a resurgence of interest in the last

467
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:02,880
few years. Li was born in China in 1943, and at the age of 40 in 1983, she moved to the aerospace

468
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,320
mecca, Huntsville, Alabama, joining the University of Huntsville, Alabama's physics department.

469
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,360
Along with her colleague Douglas Tor, Li developed a theory of gravity manipulation

470
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:19,520
involving the alignment of the rotation of ions into a lattice called a Bose-Einstein condensate

471
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:28,400
that she thought could counteract gravity. Then she tested it, suspending a test mass above a

472
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,240
spinning superconductor. And according to her, saw some pretty paradigm-shifting results,

473
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:41,760
publishing that the various masses she tested would lose between 0.5% and 2.1% of their weight

474
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:50,560
across multiple trials. This is an absolutely insane claim. Achieving weight loss or any

475
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,400
gravity reduction on a suspended object through the simple input of alternating current electricity

476
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,680
would break our conventional understanding of physics. It would unify the field, finally

477
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,720
reconciling electromagnetism and gravity, something Einstein could never do.

478
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,160
After claiming to achieve these groundbreaking results, Ning Li then makes an interesting move.

479
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:27,280
She leaves University of Huntsville, Alabama to start her own company, AC Gravity LLC. In fact,

480
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,280
Li's physics chair at Huntsville, Larry Smalley, was so convinced by the groundbreaking experimental

481
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,600
results Li had shown that he also left the University of Huntsville to join Li at her company.

482
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:45,040
When I heard this story at Rangabel, I had remembered that name, Larry Smalley. Where had

483
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,920
I seen it? Well, he's the same guy on NASA patents filed in 2004 out of the Marshall Space Flight

484
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,640
Center. The patent is for a novel barrel-shaped asymmetric capacitor. Again, capacitors are the

485
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,160
core instrument in Townsend Brown's experiments. The fact that Smalley was on the patent got me

486
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,800
thinking that maybe there's a possible lineage between Ning Li and Townsend Brown.

487
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:22,320
After Li forms her company with Smalley, AC Gravity LLC, they immediately win a DOD contract.

488
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:28,160
Li gets a security clearance, and she seems to go silent for 20 years. At the time of her winning

489
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,160
that contract, her son George noted a stark change in Li's cheery demeanor and an increased

490
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:41,120
secretiveness and somberness around the house. In 2008, Li was approached at her home by the CCP

491
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:46,880
to continue her work in China. She refused, causing them to retaliate by banning her from

492
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,920
the country even to attend her own mother's funeral. If this part of the story is true,

493
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:59,520
Li is an absolute American patriot. In 2014, Li was tragically hit by a car,

494
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,000
the shock of which gave her husband, who was walking with her, a lethal heart attack,

495
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,080
and it gave Li brain impairment until her recent death in 2021.

496
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,960
What happened to Ning Li? Yeah, I admit her, and I did sit down and I interviewed her,

497
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,360
and this was at a conference in 2003, just outside of Washington, D.C.,

498
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:28,880
run overseen by the MITRE Corporation, and it was looking at, I think, high-frequency gravitational

499
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:38,320
waves. She was an interesting character because she had been involved in some of those NASA

500
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:46,800
experiments I mentioned earlier about rotating superconductors and weight loss experiments,

501
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:55,840
and she chaired one of the sessions. I talked to her afterwards about it all. She had this view

502
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,880
that this was science and technology that should be for the people. It should be very

503
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:10,560
philanthropic in its nature and outcomes, and then I don't know how soon after that

504
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,360
it was that she went off grid. It was certainly probably about within a year that she just

505
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,560
disappeared, and no one knew what had happened to her. There are rumors of this sort of tech

506
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,520
being possibly of dual use. There's a quote from Paul Shatskin's book, actually, that Brown's work

507
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,760
could turn a thermonuclear bomb into a child's firecracker, sort of like this death ray that

508
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,360
could end the world, which would obviously be, you know, you'd have to be very conscious about

509
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,200
how you release something like that. Probably never want to release something like that,

510
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,000
at least in our present state of consciousness as humanity.

511
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,120
Indeed. Definitely a dual use aspect to it, I'm sure.

512
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,000
We have to slightly get ourselves up to a point where we're responsible enough to

513
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,480
use it responsibly.

514
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:14,720
Kind of kind of later into the book, who is Boyd Bushman?

515
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:23,680
Okay, so when I finished that German investigative bit, I came back to the US again and was

516
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,040
introduced there, a Lockheed Martin, to a guy called Boyd Bushman, Dr. Boyd Bushman, who was

517
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:38,400
a senior scientist at Lockheed Martin, Fort Worth, and I sit down and interview Boyd for a

518
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,560
documentary I was making at the time called Billion Dollar Secret, and he's the first person in the

519
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:51,920
aerospace industry who talks to me about, you know, anti-gravity and it's not crazy, you know,

520
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,400
and he even gives me some pointers and says, you know, you should go and check this out and go and

521
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:05,360
check that out. And so I did. One of the pointers he gave me was to a guy called John Hutchison,

522
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:12,240
who was a Canadian inventor in working out of Vancouver, who apparently had been funded, whose

523
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:19,920
anti-gravitational experiments have been funded by the DOD. In fact, by the guy who headed that

524
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:26,240
out was quite well known in sort of parapsychological circles, Colonel John Alexander,

525
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,040
and it involved a lot of kind of crazy equipment which John had assembled and put together in one

526
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,000
place, which I witnessed when I went over to his home, it was stuff full of old oscilloscopes and,

527
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,960
you know, Van de Graaff generators and God knows what. I then spoke to John Alexander about it,

528
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,840
who said, unfortunately, when they set up all the equipment under laboratory conditions,

529
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:54,240
none of it worked, couldn't replicate anything. But off camera and out of the laboratory,

530
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:02,640
yeah, people saw stuff fly across the room. And the big question for John and the team was,

531
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,520
was this the equipment that was doing it, or was it somehow John Hutchison doing it with his mind?

532
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:16,480
And John always says it's the equipment, but, you know, there are others who became relatively

533
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,080
convinced that there was some psychokinetic kind of influence on it all.

534
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,480
Ben Rich was a talented engineer, originally hired as a thermodynamicist for Lockheed Martin

535
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,880
before moving over to its most secretive aircraft and weaponry division, Skunk Works. In 1975,

536
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,160
he took over Skunk Works from the legendary Kelly Johnson and would go on to play a vital role in

537
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,920
the development of American stealth planes like the F-117. He did this by resuscitating the work

538
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,680
of an obscure Russian mathematician in the 60s named Ufimsev, who developed equations for

539
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,120
predicting the reflection of electromagnetic waves. Sounds like a conventionally successful

540
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:12,160
career in aerospace, right? Well, at a UCLA speech in the 90s towards the end of his life, Ben Rich,

541
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:18,400
the former director of Skunk Works, made some very strange comments alluding to Lockheed Skunk Works

542
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:26,000
having the technology to quote unquote, take ET home and travel across various star systems.

543
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,040
When asked how exactly that would work, this is what he said. He said, well, let me ask you a

544
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:37,600
question. How does ESP work? And it just threw me back. I was like, I wasn't expecting a question.

545
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,880
I was expecting him to just say something. And he said, I said, I don't know, all points in space

546
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:49,600
and time are connected. That's how it works. Turned around, walked away. Later, Ben Rich apparently

547
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:55,040
said this on his deathbed to John Andrews of Tester's Motor Corporation. We already have the

548
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,720
means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects

549
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,040
and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity.

550
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:16,160
What did Rich mean? And why did Rich's successor, Skunk Works director Robert Weiss, get involved in Tom

551
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:22,400
DeLonge's public-facing UFO organization, To the Stars Academy? These are all good questions, very

552
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:30,160
worthy of follow-up. You know, I interviewed Ben Rich a couple of times. He talked in parables.

553
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:36,960
He talked in analogies. When we were talking about stealth and he said there was a time

554
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:45,040
when stealth was deemed to be so challenging, it wasn't an easy thing at all to get an algorithm,

555
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:54,960
basically a radar baffling algorithm to fly. He said we considered actually

556
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,440
burying the whole thing, before we even got started, and burying it so that no one else got the idea.

557
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:07,840
It was a little bit like bomb physics. You know, at the moment when Einstein wrote that letter to

558
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:14,000
Roosevelt saying that a bomb is possible, he then started to get a lot of traces of what then had

559
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,440
been open discussion about the atom, splitting the atom, all of that began to disappear. And it was

560
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,760
for a while contemplated by the DoD, the few who knew about stealth and Skunk Works, that they

561
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,120
should do the same thing. This thing was so challenging that they wouldn't go ahead with it.

562
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:38,640
They'd do something else. And meanwhile, they'd erase all trace of, you know, talk about radar

563
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,160
baffling algorithms and stuff. There was even a rift right between Kelly Johnson, Ben Rich's

564
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,400
predecessor, and Ben Rich. Ben Rich was very pro-stealth, but Kelly Johnson was kind of

565
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,200
anti-stealth at the end of his career, right? I believe that to be the case. I mean, I'm, yeah.

566
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,400
Ben Rich's book. Yeah. Well, yes, I'm pretty sure that was the case. I mean, there were lots of sort

567
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:05,680
of, there were lots of different camps for and against stealth, for sure. But in the, you know,

568
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:11,600
and then as Ben Rich said to me, so in effect, what we would have done, he said, we would have,

569
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:16,320
you know, we would have boxed this thing up, we would have put a kind of date stamp on not to be

570
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:23,120
opened until, you know, 2050 or whatever. And we would have slid it into a warehouse that looks

571
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,360
a metaphorical warehouse that would have looked or resembled that which you see at the end of

572
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:37,440
Raiders of the Lost Ark with the arc. I have no idea what he meant by that. So I've sort of rather

573
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:43,680
sort of ducked, ducked away from it. Yeah. Well, then you have this bizarre resurgence of

574
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,400
kind of skunkworks, kind of public facing propaganda around UFOs or anti-gravity in the

575
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:56,640
form of To the Stars Academy. The question I've always had is like, you know, is there,

576
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:02,560
Rob Weiss got very interested, he kind of helped Tom DeLong actually write a couple of books,

577
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:07,840
Secret Machines, and then this other one with Peter Lavenda. And he gets interested in the

578
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:13,200
whole topic when Tom DeLong and Peter Lavenda start talking about celestial ascent practices.

579
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:21,680
And Kabbalah. And so is there anything there? Like, is there a through line with aerospace

580
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,080
and like this interest in mind over matter? I mean, James McDonald is a famous patron,

581
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:30,160
obviously he was very interested in parapsychology as well. At McDonnell Douglas,

582
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,160
they had their own institute. He's very close with Bob John, who's running the Paralab at Princeton.

583
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:40,800
So is there like a reality to this, you know, this interest of aerospace and consciousness?

584
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:50,480
Well, I'm very aware of the McDonald one that you mentioned. And, you know, there are

585
00:53:50,480 --> 00:54:00,720
declassified papers to show McDonald instructing his company or members of his officials within

586
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:08,640
his company to go study UFOs to see what you can learn from them. The idea being you transpose that

587
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:18,400
knowledge into aerospace programs, presumably. I'm not aware of it at the Skunk Works. I'm not

588
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:27,120
aware of it at anywhere else. The thing that I am aware of is that these companies look at

589
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:34,160
anything they can that can confer possible advantage, whatever that is. And I mean,

590
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:39,840
the other thing that impressed itself upon me and has always impressed itself upon me

591
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:49,040
is how much further the aerospace and defense industry is prepared to go in terms of looking

592
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:56,640
at what you might call heretical science than science itself is. And then, you know, you only

593
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:03,280
have to go to something like remote viewing, the psychic spying program to know that agencies like

594
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:10,240
the CIA definitely saw advantage in heretical science. I mean, there's nothing scientific

595
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:16,320
to explain remote viewing, but still they went ahead and did it anyway and funded it for

596
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:23,200
18 years or something. Yeah, you told me once that Ben Rich would refer to UFOs as unfunded

597
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:30,640
opportunities. Well, as we've already discussed, you know, these organizations aren't past

598
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:36,240
misleading you. I mean, and why not? I mean, I get it. I don't I'm not aggrieved by the fact

599
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,120
that I'm playing a game with them, or at least, you know, when I was doing this, I was playing

600
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:45,440
a game with them. I sort of I knew that it's the it's a very fine line. It's a double edged sword.

601
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:56,160
You cannot be seen to be misleading the press. Or even more than that, don't get caught if you do

602
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,920
do it. Because that's self limiting. You know, after a while, people begin to question, you know,

603
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,520
you the ethics of your company, you know, what you're up to, etc. So whatever game is being

604
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:13,520
played is incredibly subtle. I mean, I think Ben Rich was subtle. I mean, he made some very

605
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,880
enigmatic statements about these things, and particularly, you know, where they classified

606
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:25,920
aircraft butted up against the whole UFO law, the unfunded opportunity thing.

607
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,680
I mean, you can take that at face value, which is that he really did see

608
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:41,520
funding opportunities in in everything or in a lot. And you know, part of the chart,

609
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:50,320
the charter of the skunk works was to push technology in addition to responding to the

610
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:56,960
pull of technology, in other words, requirements pulls from, you know, the DOD or or whoever.

611
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:06,720
So, you know, they were always coming up with concepts for interesting, weird, flying craft.

612
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:14,000
There was this mythical aircraft out there called Aurora. And Aurora was supposed to be

613
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:22,000
a replacement for the SR-71 Blackbird, which remains to this day, I think the fastest

614
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:30,800
jet powered airplane ever built, even though it retired in 1990. And Bill again, he became

615
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:36,240
convinced that there was that this aircraft existed. Bill was a kind of Sherlock Holmes

616
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:46,800
of our world. He would piece together clues that the Black World left in public or hadn't even

617
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:53,680
intended to leave in public, and would follow these clues and build them up. And so between us, we

618
00:57:54,080 --> 00:58:01,520
went on this kind of hunt for classified aircraft, of which there were a few in the 80s and 90s. And

619
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:10,320
so that's sort of, that was my grounding in the world of sort of secret stuff.

620
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:18,320
He kind of documents an oil rig engineer, right, in the North Sea, drawing up a little sketch of

621
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:25,280
the Aurora, right? And then you have unattributable sonic booms in the desert of California

622
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:31,520
that, you know, it's clearly not the Space Shuttle, it's not the SR-71. And so what's going on there?

623
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:36,800
And then you had your own experience, right, at Skunk Works? Do you want to talk about that?

624
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:46,240
Yeah, that's quite a bit to put together there. So, yes, there were some of the things that we

625
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:53,600
were talking about. There were sightings and there were soundings of this thing purportedly.

626
00:58:53,600 --> 00:59:01,920
So the U.S. Geological Survey had detected through its seismic sensors in California,

627
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:08,800
which are there to obviously to monitor for earthquake activity. It had detected booms,

628
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:15,760
sonic booms, coming in from the Pacific heading towards Area 51 in Nevada, because the sensors

629
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,240
you could, the sensors were positioned in such a way that you could track the progress of,

630
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:27,200
you know, whatever seismic disturbance or sonic disturbance there was. And all of these booms

631
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:35,120
were tracking towards Area 51 in Nevada. It wasn't the Space Shuttle because the Space Shuttle wasn't

632
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:44,640
flying that day. Other aircraft were deemed not to be responsible for it. So that was kind of

633
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:53,680
one pointer towards a secret hypersonic aircraft that was under test at Area 51 in the late 1980s.

634
00:59:54,320 --> 01:00:02,960
The oil rig sighting was interesting. So a guy called Chris Gibson, who was working on an oil

635
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:11,600
rig in the North Sea, somewhere between the UK and Germany, I guess, or Norway, he looks up and

636
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:22,400
he sees this dart like black arrow shaped thing high, escorted by what he took to be,

637
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:28,240
I think it was three or four F-111s, which were swing wing American aircraft, which were based

638
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:39,360
in the UK at the time. And it was being tanked in midair by a Boeing tanker, a 135 tanker.

639
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:48,400
We used to get reports like this all the time into Jane's, and I would or Bill would. But

640
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:55,520
what made this one credible was that Chris Gibson was a Royal Observer Corps observer.

641
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:02,960
The Royal Observer Corps was set up as a sort of citizen monitoring service for the impending war,

642
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:10,080
Second World War, and is incredibly disciplined in its approach to how it observes things.

643
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:16,800
So Chris Gibson was no ordinary plane spotter. He was a Royal Observer Corps plane spotter.

644
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:23,520
And he drew a sketch of this thing immediately afterwards. And I think he sat on it for a while,

645
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:34,560
but then eventually sent it to Bill Sweetman. And Bill ran then a story piecing together the

646
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:39,440
evidence for Aurora with all the engineering evidence. And there was a lot of engineering

647
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:47,040
evidence too, because there was a program running at the time through NASA and the DOD called NASP,

648
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:56,400
National Aerospace Plane, the X-30. Started by Reagan with lots of money behind it.

649
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:02,400
Reagan called it the Orient Express, in that this thing was due to fly from the US to

650
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:11,840
somewhere in Singapore, China, Hong Kong, wherever, in 45 minutes. And Bill became convinced that

651
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:20,960
NASP was actually a cover program for Aurora, in that it sort of channeled through the white world,

652
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,840
so through the non-classified world, a bunch of technologies like

653
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:35,040
scramjets, supersonic combustion ramjets, which is what you'd need for a very high flying

654
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:46,400
sort of super cruising aircraft like Aurora. And also things like new materials. I mean, materials

655
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,360
in hypersonic program are key, because

656
01:02:51,760 --> 01:03:00,320
you know, basic metals have kind of reached the end of their useful life as an airframe material.

657
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:06,720
You had to come up with new stuff like sort of pyro ceramic. And Bill had tracked a lot of this

658
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:14,880
through NASP. NASP then died, went nowhere, supposedly. But it was felt, at least by Bill,

659
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,080
and I tend to agree with him, that there were spinoffs from that program that went into a

660
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:29,040
classified program. So while Bill was off doing all of this stuff, I was interviewing various

661
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:36,880
people about, yeah, it was mainly day-to-day bread and butter stuff. And one of the series that I

662
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:45,280
wanted to run was about how the skunk works, which is the secret sort of development,

663
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,520
high tech, very high tech arm of Lockheed Martin, how techniques from these companies,

664
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:56,560
which were then beginning to come out of the shadows just after the end of the Cold War,

665
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:05,520
after the fall of the Berlin War, how they were spinning out their hard earned business acumen,

666
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:10,320
and so how to build things quick and cheaply. Because of course, they've done that in the black.

667
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:17,440
Um, into the overall corporation. So there was a business story there.

668
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:23,680
And I went to talk to the head of the Skunk Works guy, then head of the Skunk Works,

669
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:32,160
I think he took over after maybe a couple after the famous Ben Rich, who I'd also interviewed.

670
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:39,120
But Jack Gordon was then the head of the Skunk Works. So I went to interview him,

671
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:44,400
and in a rare dispensation, they invited me to go and interview him in the headquarters building,

672
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:49,520
which is actually on the secret part of the Skunk Works site. Normally, you'd interview somebody

673
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:58,480
like that in what's kind of like the Skunk Works had an airlock, which was a sanitized part of the

674
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:04,960
Skunk Works across the railway tracks in Palmdale, where you would not encounter anything secret.

675
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:10,480
But I was escorted onto the sort of secret part into the headquarters building,

676
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:16,800
interviewed Jack Gordon, who said a few weird things like, I've been responsible 15 real flying

677
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:24,160
aircraft in my time. But I can, sorry, I can only talk about 12 of them. So there were these missing

678
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:29,600
three, which, you know, we chit chatted about for a while, but I didn't get very far. And those

679
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:34,160
aircraft have never, to my knowledge, those have never been revealed, those, those missing three.

680
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:41,120
And so then when the interview finished, I was being escorted back out of the building again

681
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:48,880
to the waiting car that would take me back to the sanitized part of Skunk Works. When I'm passing

682
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:56,640
this org chart, and it's a chart that depicts in graphical form, aircraft from the Skunk Works

683
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:06,320
beginnings, which were in 1940s through to the then modern day, which was, as I say, mid 90s.

684
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:11,680
So I think the aircraft that should have been at the top of that list that was acknowledged,

685
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:20,160
it was either the prototype of the F-22, the YF-22, or it was Dark Star, which was a drone,

686
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,720
which got canceled. I think it was Dark Star. That's what I should have seen. Instead, what

687
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:30,320
I saw above it was something called Astra. And I turned to my escort and I said,

688
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,920
oh, that's interesting. What's Astra? And you've never seen anyone bundled out of a building so

689
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:45,520
quickly as I was when I, when I mentioned that, that plane. Now, a few posts, I talk about that

690
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:51,040
in the Hub Zero Point, as you say, there were a few postscripts to that, which came after I'd

691
01:06:51,040 --> 01:07:00,480
written The Hunt. One was that I ran into, just through the job, I ran into several bosses of the

692
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:08,400
Skunk Works after Jack Gordon at various trade shows and what have you. One of them, I sat down

693
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,560
and talked to about that incident. I said, are you aware of that Astra incident and what happened to

694
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:21,840
me? And he said, oh yeah. He said, we're all aware of that incident. We, you know, there's no one in

695
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:26,160
the Skunk Works who doesn't know what happened that day. Showing that there's something there.

696
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:31,600
Well, maybe. Or, so I go- It'd be not memorable if there was nothing there.

697
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:39,280
Yeah. Because, because on the face of it, it was a major fuck up. I mean, it was a real goof.

698
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:44,720
And so I said, okay, well, let's talk about that. And I said, that's interesting. So,

699
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,840
so what's happened to Astra then? He said, oh, it hasn't flown yet.

700
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:57,200
I'm guessing this could be a decade after this incident happened. So I said, okay. I said,

701
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:02,800
are you expecting it to fly anytime soon? And he said, yeah, it'll make an appearance sometime soon.

702
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:10,160
Okay. So, and I go, well, thanks. I said, thanks. Okay. And he says something enigmatic,

703
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:16,080
like keep watching the skies, you know. Anyway, it hasn't appeared. To the best of my knowledge,

704
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:21,120
it has not appeared either. Various drone programs have, but I don't think they really

705
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:26,080
account for what I saw or the description of it. So I think that's the end of the story.

706
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:31,520
And it was only relatively recently. I mean, like a few years back, I keep all my diaries. So I'm

707
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,160
flicking back through my diaries. And I come across the day that I went to the Skunk Works,

708
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:42,160
and I saw Astra at the top of that chart. And I look at the date, and it's April the 1st,

709
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:51,920
April Fool's Day. And that makes me think, okay, okay. I think I understand what was happening

710
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:57,920
that day, which was, yeah, I think so. Why was I ushered into the headquarters building

711
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,800
when no one else was? They knew I was going to be writing a story about this stuff. It was all

712
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:09,680
sanctioned. It was on the record. And conveniently, as I walk out of the building, I see the org chart,

713
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:14,320
which actually, I'm amazed I missed it on the way in. Maybe somebody put it up while I was

714
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:21,840
doing the interview. Anyway, I see the org chart. And you could construe it this way, which is I

715
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:30,480
was meant to see it, and I was meant to write it. And there are all kinds of tricks and games and

716
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:39,680
things that unwittingly we get drawn into as journalists. And it wouldn't surprise me at all

717
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:45,680
if going back home, and when I did write about it, and I did put a really big caveat into that

718
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:51,120
story when I wrote about it, saying, I can't be sure that something like Astra exists. And I don't

719
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:56,560
even know what it is or what it could be if it exists. It could be a stealth aircraft. It could

720
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:03,120
be a reconnaissance aircraft. It could be a hypersonic plane. But I think someone somewhere

721
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:07,680
wanted me to write about it. Interesting. And so, you know, those are the sorts of kind of

722
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:13,360
breadcrumbs that you get fed. And of course, you've got to try and keep a watchful eye out.

723
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:18,880
This was after you had been digging up with Bill Sweetman a lot of the kind of facts around the

724
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:24,320
Aurora and you'd been on record. So that would make sense. We published a big story about Aurora

725
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:28,000
in Jane's Defense Weekly. Okay. Well, then they could have been trying to trick you. Could have

726
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,560
been. Because, you know, if you're already on their radar, why have you in the, you know,

727
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,600
next to the crown jewels at the center of everything in Palmdale? That's interesting.

728
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,760
But the Aurora, there's just some, I mean, there's the evidence we just discussed.

729
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:47,360
And then there's also, you know, I think British Ministry of Defense documents from the early 90s

730
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:54,240
talking about hypersonic craft with kind of novel propulsion from the U.S. There's the 1968,

731
01:10:54,240 --> 01:11:00,400
or sorry, 1986 budget where it shows up as a line item for I think at like two billion dollars or

732
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:05,440
something. And Ben Rich has to kind of explain that away. Yeah. So do you, I mean, do you have

733
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:11,280
like a base case of, you know, are these, are these crafts real or not? Or, you know, obviously

734
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,920
you have to think probabilistically, but. Yeah. I mean, as you say, there are very good

735
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:24,880
pointers to say it existed. Not least of which was it appeared a pretty firm conviction by the UK

736
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:32,480
MOD that it existed. And that appearances of this aircraft over the UK, there were rumors it was

737
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:40,640
based out of the UK for a while at a remote Scottish base called RAF Macrohanish. So there

738
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:46,720
was that side of things. I've interviewed, I mean, I had a fascinating talk with an RAF pilot

739
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:57,760
that I ran into once who said that he had talked to pilots who had encountered the Aurora

740
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:05,360
in the North Sea, I mean, over the North Sea. And actually, if that was the case,

741
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:12,320
a tornado RAF tornado with swing wings actually looks an awful lot like an F-111.

742
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:18,800
And despite the skills of Chris Gibson, he could have mistaken a tornado, a swing wing tornado for

743
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:26,880
a swing wing F-111. So I've had it, you know, I'm pretty good authority from people, you know,

744
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:34,000
qualified RAF military pilots. Oh, and sworn to secrecy as well on that, that the thing was real.

745
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:44,880
I sort of, but just on a sort of gut level, sort of instinct thing. I think that the slam dunk for

746
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:50,560
me was an interview I did, which also talked about in the hunt for zero point, with a guy called

747
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:56,480
General George Molner, who was the US Air Force's head of research and development until his

748
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:06,240
retirement in 1998. I was lucky in that I got to interview him on the day of his retirement.

749
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:15,360
So I think it was in June or July 1998. And the subject was black programs. So that was the

750
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:20,720
official on the record. That's what we were going to talk about discussion. And I filmed it for a

751
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:28,160
documentary that I did at a time called Billion Dollar Secret. And I bring up all of these sightings,

752
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:35,520
you know, with him of weird craft that have been spotted in Colorado and Nevada. And I said, look,

753
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:39,840
you know, some of these things are silent, for heaven's sake, you know, they hover over

754
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:45,920
witnesses, they make no noise. And I'm talking about some pretty grounded witnesses here,

755
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,880
you know, there are ranchers who they know the land, they might not know too much about aircraft,

756
01:13:50,880 --> 01:14:01,200
but they have a good sense of what's going on in there and over their territory. And so we talked

757
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:08,080
a little bit about that. And he was kind of joking about UFO sightings over, you know, Utah, Colorado,

758
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:13,360
and Nevada. And then we got onto the subject of Aurora. And I said, look, you know, you're

759
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:19,040
retiring today, what can you say about the existence of this mythical Mark five hypersonic

760
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:27,040
aircraft? And he said, Well, I'll leave you with a sort of bit of a puzzle. And he said,

761
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:37,600
we had we had a problem in the late 80s early 90s, which was the SR 71 Blackbird was retiring.

762
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:48,000
We had a generation of analog satellites, which was coming to an end, and was being retired,

763
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:54,080
phased out of service, deorbited. And there was a new generation of these keyhole satellites,

764
01:14:54,080 --> 01:15:00,560
I think it was KH 11 keyhole satellites, which were digital satellites, which fed real time imagery

765
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:06,720
back to earth. He said, but we had a gap between the two. We had no SR 71. We had no

766
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:16,960
satellite coverage. So what would you do? So well, what I would do is pretty much what

767
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:25,600
most people, Bill Sweetman included kind of think Aurora was, which was a what they call

768
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:33,280
a deployable prototype. So you build a few to test the concept, see if it works. You might send it on

769
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:41,600
a few missions, you might even deploy it to somewhere like the UK for a bit. But, you know,

770
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:51,040
this thing is expensive. It drinks whatever fuel it uses. And whilst it has a utility,

771
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:57,440
the utility of a thing like Aurora, even when you have spy satellites is that you know when spy

772
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:02,560
satellites are coming over, and you can scoot and hide from them. You don't know when a hypersonic

773
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:08,160
aircraft is coming over, or you don't have much warning time. So there was real utility in this

774
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:17,840
thing. But, you know, if you take General Mullner's advice at face value, this thing just filled a

775
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,600
gap. And when it had done its job of filling the gap, they went back to spy satellites.

776
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,480
Interesting. That's an interesting theory.

777
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:31,840
You know, the technology is one thing. But actually, it's sort of really more a journey

778
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:40,320
of the mind. It's about the notion that, you know, there are some things that we might never,

779
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:46,480
ever know about. And we have to live with that. And that can be frustrating for people. I mean,

780
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:56,800
it was frustrating for me at the time. And how do you shake out on all this? I know we're kind

781
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:02,480
of wrapping up here. But how do you think that aerospace made real breakthroughs in

782
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:06,080
anti-gravity? Do you think they didn't? Where are they now?

783
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:15,040
Our interview sadly abruptly stopped recording here due to some mysterious

784
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:20,160
AV difficulties at our studios, right at a pivotal time in which Nick Cook was answering

785
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:25,040
maybe the most important question. But I think it's sort of fitting for this topic.

786
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,960
And it does justice to the healthy nuance of the hunt for zero point.

787
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:35,600
If you take my friend and founder of Army Futures Command, Karl Nell's statements in the debrief

788
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,640
to be true, then we're in an arms race right now with the Russians and the Chinese to reverse

789
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:46,960
engineer UFOs. If that's the case, the U.S. government should be very worried. The American

790
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:52,560
programs are balkanized, siloed in these old stodgy corporations that hit their peaks in

791
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:57,680
the 50s and 60s. They're not hiring America's best and brightest because they don't want to

792
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:16,000
risk losing their super secret IP. But you can be sure that the Russians and Chinese,

793
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,520
with their nationalized and centralized efforts, are recruiting their best scientists to work on

794
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:27,120
these topics. They're not worried about losing profits. They're focused instead on national defense.

795
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:35,040
I also think that as far as pushing disclosure around the ontological truth behind a lot of

796
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:40,560
this secret science and the UFO question, the national security argument just seems to get

797
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:46,160
lawmakers' attention much faster than anything else. Finally, I think that all technology is dual

798
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:51,680
use, and academia has completely stagnated and is stuck in the wrong frameworks. So,

799
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:56,720
if we can funnel more money and resources into these heterodox science projects,

800
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:02,160
we can make progress much faster. Personally, I'm far more interested in the potential for

801
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:08,160
this technology to actually take us interstellar. And if we do live in a multiverse as physicists

802
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:14,000
and the public love to theorize these days, then cracking gravity might be the key to jumping timelines.

803
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:22,240
In general relativity, gravity and time are tightly coupled, so the only way to manipulate

804
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:27,600
time would involve the manipulation of gravity. And all true interstellar travel would require

805
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:35,600
time travel or space-time metric engineering. In the 1950s, the future was an exciting thing.

806
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:41,360
We weren't locked into this AI dystopian nightmare we find ourselves in today. If we figure out the

807
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:47,120
gravity question, maybe we can get back to the future or, in the words of the great Donnie Darko,

808
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:52,880
learn to travel in God's channel. I hope you all enjoyed this and learned something. I want to

809
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:57,360
thank Nick Cook for his time and his excellent book, The Hunt for Zero Point. Please go out and

810
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:03,360
read it, along with his new amazing serialized book on Substack, The Light Beyond the Mountains,

811
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:08,800
which I'm linking in the description. Till next time, I'm Jesse Michaels, and this is American

812
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:19,680
Alchemy.
