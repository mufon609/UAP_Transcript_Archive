1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
If you were asked to appear before Congress under oath, would you willingly do that?

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,760
The only way I'll testify actually, the reality is in a classified setting.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,240
DOD can come after me.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,480
What happened to Dave Grush?

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,400
Physically harassed at his home and in his vehicles after he filed his whistleblower complaint.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
It was before he ever testified.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,400
All I have was the stuff that I accumulated and gathered going up through the OSAP and ATIP.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,160
And that's how I met Dave Grush.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,640
Jay Stratton introduced me to Dave.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,520
He was the NRO liaison officer to the UAPTF.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,480
So anyway, I met both of them and I gave Dave all my data, all my briefing information,

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,840
and he took that, ran with it, and he found everything.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,840
George Bush, when he was the CIA director, he was given some pretty spectacular information

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,640
about a major UAP event that took place in the early 60s.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,280
And Bush's eyes lit up and this is what he told me.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,680
He said, what are you talking about?

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,160
The Pentagon liaison officer told him all about it.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,200
He said, are you kidding me?

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,080
There's a there there?

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,560
Yeah. And he said, absolutely.

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,200
And he said, well, I want to see the evidence.

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,520
And the evidence was in the form of documentation, but the film was the primary thing.

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,520
We are thrilled to announce this special episode of American Alchemy featuring a groundbreaking

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,920
interview with the legendary Eric Davis.

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:27,360
Eric is a renowned scientist, Hal Putoff's protege, and probably more of an expert in

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,840
UFO propulsion and exotic physics principles than just about anybody on earth.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,320
He's written a fantastic book called The Frontiers of Propulsion Science, which is as

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,600
comprehensive of an overview as you could possibly get when it comes to exotic propulsion

29
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,000
and anomalies in topological physics.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,760
He's also written all sorts of great research papers on subjects ranging from UAP tracking

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,360
to quantum teleportation.

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,960
This conversation wouldn't have been possible without my technical correspondent, pseudonymously

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,000
named Jack or Missileman on Twitter.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,840
Jack has over 15 years of experience in defense in aerospace and holds a very strong background

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,040
in mathematics, materials, R&D and physics.

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,080
For now, he's chosen to remain pseudonymous due to his work in sensitive areas of national security.

37
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,760
Jack and I are going to be starting a technical series together on UFO physics.

38
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,400
It's going to be an extremely deep dive on how UFOs fly, the exotic principles they employ,

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,040
and materials they use.

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,440
But this interview also involves some incredible journalists in the world of UFOs.

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,080
This interview would not have been possible without them.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,440
First off, thank you to Thenvir, the incredible host of Catastrophic Disclosure.

43
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,680
I also want to thank his partner on the channel, Katarina, who is a biomedical PhD.

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,040
She's brilliant and she's the editor and videographer on the channel.

45
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,000
We're also super grateful to James Falk, host of Neon Galactic, a PBS-affiliated podcast

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,320
and YouTube channel, which goes into UAP's consciousness.

47
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,640
It's incredibly deep and worth checking out.

48
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,800
Rob Jones was also involved here.

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,400
He's a nuclear engineer and Navy sailor.

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,920
Go follow him on Twitter for some incredible insights.

51
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,520
Finally, I want to give a special shout out and thank you to UAP Gerb.

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,680
He is honestly the deepest researcher I've met in the last year when it comes to UAPs.

53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,320
He runs an incredible channel called UAP Gerb.

54
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,840
He's deeper than just about anybody I know on nuts and bolts UFO research.

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,920
We're going to drop an interview very soon and hopefully all of you get to see how ridiculously

56
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,760
impressive his knowledge is.

57
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,280
So if you're going to watch this interview, please subscribe to all of these channels.

58
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,440
They're going to come out with variations of this interview with commentary and other

59
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,400
remixes and maybe even some footage that we don't include here on their own respective

60
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
channels.

61
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,560
They're doing incredibly important work.

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,520
Consider subscriptions on those channels, the passcode for watching this interview.

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,560
We need more people covering this topic.

64
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,320
The point is there's strength in numbers.

65
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,600
We're all on the same team and we need as many high credibility, high quality people

66
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,640
covering this as possible.

67
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,040
Without further ado, please enjoy this special episode of American Alchemy with our amazing

68
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:13,560
technical correspondent, Jack and the prince of exotic propulsion himself, Eric W. Davis.

69
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,920
So the little aerospace guys, the autotap guys, the ATIP guys, y'all have been at the

70
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,640
forefront of really starting the public discourse on all of this stuff.

71
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:29,640
And Dr. Jim Lukaski, he mentioned if he were asked to testify before Congress, he would

72
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:36,720
actually lie before Congress instead of, you know, speaking against his NDAs and to honor

73
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,000
his NDAs and the things he's, you know, wants to protect.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,240
And so I know that's a bit controversial because at this point, New Elizondo has testified.

75
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,280
We interviewed him last week.

76
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,120
And they did so under oath.

77
00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:00,360
So Jim didn't say what happens if he takes an oath, because if he takes an oath lying

78
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,720
to Congress in a testimony as perjury, then he can go to jail for that.

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,560
And you saw what happened to the NDA.

80
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:15,720
Hopefully the NDA will prevent him from giving testimony, but however, if they issue him

81
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,880
a subpoena to appear before Congress, then he's going to have to work with the DOD staff

82
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,240
to figure out how to how he's going to do it.

83
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,960
Now here's how Dave Gresh did it.

84
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,920
Dave Gresh was able to give was approved by the Department of Defense.

85
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,480
I don't remember what the acronym means anymore as TOPSR.

86
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,480
So TOPSR approved his public testimony and approved what he could say publicly.

87
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,760
The rest of what he couldn't say publicly, he said in a classified hearing.

88
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,600
So we had a classified hearing on his whistleblower complaint.

89
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,360
Jim would have to do the same thing, and Jim should know that.

90
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,280
And I worked with him on the OSAP, so I know him.

91
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,440
So he, I don't know why he was said have to lie before Congress.

92
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,040
He knows if you're going to take an oath before the committee lying as perjury and you're

93
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,040
in trouble.

94
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,440
The NDA issue can be worked out with the TOPSR.

95
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,080
However, there are times when they don't administer an oath, but you don't want to lie because

96
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,000
that'll be a public reputation damage on you.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Right.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,480
If even though you didn't take an oath, but you lied before Congress, you told you lied.

99
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,320
I know for you, it's kind of a weird state right now because your alleged memo has been

100
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
entered into Congressional record.

101
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,560
And so my question is simply this, if you were asked to appear before Congress under

102
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,160
oath, would you willingly do that?

103
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Would you testify?

104
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,160
I would have to get advice from a lawyer first.

105
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Very smart answer.

106
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,440
I'd have to get an advice from a lawyer who has a background in that particular issue

107
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,960
because DOD can come after me and the IC could come after me.

108
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,760
They could permit me from getting a job again by making sure that I don't get my security

109
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,520
clearances passed.

110
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,240
And what happened to Dave Grush after he filed his whistleblower complaint?

111
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,280
It was before he ever testified.

112
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,000
What happened to Dave Grush is he got harassed and intimidated, both him and his wife.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,600
He got harassed by someone in the National Reconnaissance Office, and then he got physically

114
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,200
harassed at his home and in his vehicles by people unknown.

115
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,800
And then somebody leaked a PTSD episode he had because remember, he's a war veteran and

116
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,960
he was in the combat field and he suffered PTSD and was going through a crisis with his

117
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
wife.

118
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,920
Somebody decides they're going to illegally go into his private medical files, violate

119
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:39,600
the HIPAA law, and release that to the news media so that they can attack his character.

120
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,920
And there are a lot more lawyers at this point on your side, on the UAP Disclosure Fund,

121
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,340
and a number of other organizations have spun up to offer pro bono legal support to whistleblowers

122
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,320
and people being harassed.

123
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,920
Do you feel any better than, do you feel like it's safer now than it was when Dave came

124
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
out?

125
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
Possibly.

126
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,640
I just have to have a lawyer tell me, look at the situation, look at the circumstances

127
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:09,600
under which Admiral Wilson gave me information and then find out if that's something I should

128
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,640
do at the level of Congressional hearing.

129
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Congressional hearing.

130
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
That's ironic.

131
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Hang on.

132
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,880
I briefed the Senate Select Committee of Intelligence staff and the Senate Armed Services Committee

133
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,760
staff in classified settings.

134
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,960
What happened is I briefed the first group in 2019, then later now we're in 2022, and

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,760
another group comes out to Huntsville.

136
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,440
Instead of me going to DC, they're coming out to see me in Huntsville, and I'm briefing

137
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
them.

138
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
So it's a new group of people.

139
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,520
And after one phone call with Representative Mike Gallagher, Republican representative

140
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,240
of his district in Wyoming, so I had a short phone call with him, maybe about 20, 25 minutes.

141
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:54,520
And then I had an interview just last month with the two senior staff on the subcommittee

142
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,880
that just recently held the House hearings that Lou Elizondo appeared at.

143
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
So they asked me a lot of questions.

144
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,880
They were short on time, so we had a half hour conversation and there really should

145
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,440
have been a follow-up interview because there were more open questions left to be answered

146
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,900
that they didn't have time.

147
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,600
They never followed up and I never got an invite to testify.

148
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,960
I have made it known that the only way I'll testify actually, the reality is in a classified

149
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
setting.

150
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,960
I would imagine there's not much slam dunk testimony that can be given in the unclassified

151
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
thing.

152
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Right.

153
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,040
Well, I'll tell you this, Dave did give the classified testimony.

154
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
He gave them everything.

155
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,360
He gave them the names and locations and programs and people.

156
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,960
All I have was the stuff that I accumulated and gathered going up through the OSAP and

157
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
ATIP.

158
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,760
And what happened during the UAPETF was what Jay Stratton was doing then.

159
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,960
So I had left that area and then I had a little bit of stuff going on when I worked for the

160
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,800
Aerospace Corporation and that's how I met Dave Brush.

161
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,320
Jay Stratton introduced me to Dave and his government customer, who I won't name.

162
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:09,840
He was a GS-15 at the time and Dave worked for him and he got promoted later to SCS-1.

163
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,240
This anonymous individual.

164
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,080
This is the one that Dave worked with at the NRO.

165
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,960
And so I briefed them.

166
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,040
So they basically invited me through the Aerospace Corporation apparatus because Aerospace is

167
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,760
the FFRC that supports NRO.

168
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,000
And so they have a contract and they flew me out to where they were located in Colorado

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,120
Springs and I gave them both briefings.

170
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,400
Not just them.

171
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,440
This included the aerospace personnel that were supporting the office.

172
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,760
The NRO was a tenant organization in the aerospace campus there.

173
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,360
So we have one building now, it's two, and in that one building they have skiffs building

174
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,360
entire floors and then office suites that are built inside of skiffs that close the

175
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
office suites.

176
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,760
So this program that Dave and his government customer worked at was one of those office

177
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,000
suites in a skip.

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So that GS-15 has a number of aerospace employees supporting his program.

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,620
And Dave was doing some aspect of that on the security side as one of Jay Stratton's

180
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,640
contributors to the UAPTF because he was the NRO liaison officer to the UAPTF.

181
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,480
So anyway, I met both of them and I gave Dave all my data, all my briefing information

182
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,200
and he took that, ran with it and he found everything.

183
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,520
And then later on, I think maybe a year or two later, yeah, actually almost two years

184
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,960
later, somewhere in that period, they finally got to meet with Hal Puthoff and he briefed

185
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,240
them with his set of information, a lot of what he has overlaps mine, but I have a lot

186
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,880
of unique information both in and outside of the era of the 15 years that I worked with

187
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Hal.

188
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,360
And Hal knew some of that, a lot of it came from AFRL and then a lot of it came through

189
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:56,240
the OSAP with my interactions with the CIA and other agencies and companies and so forth.

190
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,240
So Dave, yeah, Dave basically ran with our data, mine and Hal's, and found everything.

191
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,200
Found 40 witnesses, I'm not going to say who they are, but I could say that I know two

192
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
of them.

193
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,400
Can you say how many of them are in this building?

194
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,480
I'll say I know that at least one, that only one of them is in the building and the guy

195
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,200
who didn't come to the conference because he had a travel conflict for a prearranged,

196
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,160
I think family trip or something, if he were here, he'd be the second one and all the rest

197
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,480
of them are not here in the building.

198
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,840
And there's more to it than that, but I can't discuss it because then that would identify

199
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,680
who the two witnesses are.

200
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,760
So yesterday you made some pretty remarkable statements on kind of finding evidence of

201
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,360
legacy programs while working at OSAP.

202
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,920
And you mentioned that under Eisenhower, P-E-A-D-S's Presidential Emergency Action

203
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,040
Documents were kind of used to create WAVE special access programs free from congressional

204
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
oversight.

205
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,840
I wanted to see during your time investigating legacy programs, did you encounter other kind

206
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,400
of unique classification standards like no foreign, no foreign national excluded program

207
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,720
material for these programs kind of dealing with NHI artifacts?

208
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,640
Yeah, those are not new or unusual.

209
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,280
There's known SCI compartments, SCI being Sensitive Compartmentalized Information, but

210
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,160
there's hidden SCI compartments and that's what a lot of the American public is not aware

211
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
of.

212
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,480
That's not talked about a lot.

213
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,360
And then there's the special access programs and you've got four types, you've got regular

214
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,880
SAPs, just special access program, then you have a WAVE special access program, you'll

215
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,440
have an unacknowledged one and then you'll have a WAVE unacknowledged one.

216
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,440
And actually, I'm not sure that the two in the middle are separate really, I think more

217
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,120
likely it's WAVED and unacknowledged at the same time.

218
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,680
So that might be just a third category or even just a second category.

219
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,600
So Dave and I had a lot of discussions.

220
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,240
I went through, when I was at aerospace, I went through special access program security

221
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:57,240
training so I could qualify to be, it's not that I wanted to qualify to be a security

222
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,760
officer, I just wanted to qualify to indicate to the company and the government customers

223
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,680
that I've gone through that level of training comparable to what security officers for special

224
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,080
access programs have.

225
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,520
And so that would help my eligibility to get access more than anything.

226
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
And that didn't happen.

227
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
I didn't get it.

228
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,840
But I did get, I did do the training.

229
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,600
So Dave and I talked about that as a consequence.

230
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,400
And I said, Dave, it seems like these hidden SCIs are no different than SAPs.

231
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,440
And so that's when he said, yeah, really, they've been having that argument among the

232
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,400
personnel security experts throughout the IC and the DOD.

233
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,280
They've been having an argument for some significant period of time over really whether

234
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,080
there is a real distinction between a hidden SCI and an SAP.

235
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,560
Most of the people like Dave and I actually came to the conclusion that SAPs are just

236
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,160
the same thing as a hidden SCI.

237
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,600
I think something a lot of people don't ask that has kind of captured my attention.

238
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,440
During your time investigating legacy programs, did you see much collaboration or

239
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,040
compartmentalization between programs that may exist in Navy, Air Force, Army?

240
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,200
It's too stove-piped or compartmentalized.

241
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,160
You can't open it up to another one unless there is a need to do that.

242
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,360
That need to get access is defined on a government form called the DD-254.

243
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:22,080
And the DD-254 documents who has access and why and what gets accessed.

244
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:28,480
And if you're going to have to get access to another compartmentalized program, then

245
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,680
that has to be justified in the DD-254.

246
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,440
And usually that's not justified because programs don't really overlap.

247
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,920
However, I think it was Bill Sweetman back in the 1980s who did a deep dive in this after

248
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,520
Reagan became president.

249
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:54,400
And he did correctly say that the compartmentalization of SCIs, but mostly SAPs, was really horrible

250
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,480
because you end up duplicating programs, doing the same thing.

251
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,600
So we're now spending taxpayers' dollars at twice the magnitude doing the same thing

252
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,560
between two programs, and they can't communicate that to you.

253
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,800
They can't elaborate.

254
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,000
They can't come to an understanding and say, hey, oh yeah, you exist, oh, and you exist,

255
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,360
and what you're working on is what we're working on, but we're spending all the government's

256
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,240
money this way.

257
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,720
Why don't we join forces and maybe cut the budget?

258
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,920
But that isn't what happens.

259
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,640
You can't do that.

260
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,160
You actually sent me the article to the Liberation Times piece that Chris Sharpe wrote.

261
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,920
He was kind of describing, for I think the first time, some of the intimate details of

262
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,600
the ecosystem of the program, eponymously.

263
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,920
And that was where I heard for the first time that DOE and then, what was it called?

264
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:46,600
Office of C.I.A. Weapons Counter-Proliferation Center.

265
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,720
That's the modern name of WINPAC, the Weapons Intelligence Nuclear Proliferation and Arm

266
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,440
Control.

267
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,960
I actually got hired by the C.I.A. to be the branch chief scientist of WINPAC back in late

268
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,080
2003.

269
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,400
Wow.

270
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,760
And so they talked about how DOE, that group, and a bunch of combatant commands all do their

271
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,200
own thing to some extent.

272
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:14,360
And there's really not an executive head adjudicating conflicts or do work like you're

273
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,920
saying.

274
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,720
You could have Navy programs and Air Force programs doing the same thing.

275
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,560
Keep in mind that that, we call it the counter-proliferation program, and WINPAC are

276
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,160
actually multi-agency.

277
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,920
They're not just the C.I.A.

278
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,840
They're C.I.A., NSA, NRO, because when I got hired, the hiring manager that was going to

279
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:38,440
be my boss, he briefed me on what my job duties were going to be, what organizations were

280
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,360
involved, and that I was going to interface with all these organizations.

281
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,920
And he wrote down two long lists on a couple of, well, two lists on a couple of columns.

282
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:54,280
They weren't that long, but they were all the agencies that were fused together to run

283
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,880
the WINPAC operation.

284
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,240
So WINPAC will seek resources and personnel from that agency.

285
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,240
That agency, this agency, and that agency do accomplish different things.

286
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,520
I think one WINPAC member recently mentioned kind of as a gatekeeper of legacy programs was

287
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,320
Glenn Gaffney.

288
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,320
If you guys remember that from various reporting, I think Chris Sharp touched on it as well.

289
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,120
Did you ever interact with Glenn Gaffney?

290
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,280
I didn't have direct interaction with him.

291
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,680
But the aerospace defense firm that we were working, we were trying to work with during

292
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:35,560
the OSAP, had direct interaction with him, as well as he was a senior VP, and the executive

293
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,080
VP of the corporation, they had to have a conversation with Glenn Gaffney.

294
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,440
And he was very antagonistic about that company releasing to us, under the DIA-

295
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,480
To NIDS.

296
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,400
To NIDS, right?

297
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:47,880
To us?

298
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:54,120
No, to Bigler Aerospace Advanced Space Studies and ERTEC, to release to us their collection

299
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,440
of crash retrieval materials that they've had since before got shut down in 89.

300
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,200
So he stepped right in the middle of it.

301
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,360
First, he was surprised that that company still retained materials that when they were

302
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,600
supposed to give it up and return it back in 89.

303
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,240
No kidding.

304
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:16,520
And then he said his answer to that whole question about giving permission for them

305
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,760
to share it with us under that classified setting, because that was SAP level, we were

306
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,600
TSSEI, we were trying to get SAP, and Harry Reid was trying to get Deputy Secretary of

307
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,000
Defense William Lin to give us an SAP, and William Lin denied his request.

308
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,040
And the reason why he denied it is because Harry Reid was using political muscle, and

309
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,000
you can't do that.

310
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:44,360
It has to go through the security channels and the program management to create a justification

311
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,880
and a need to give a program that's already TSSEI a SAP level.

312
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,520
Right.

313
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,960
Okay, add on SAP.

314
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,160
Yeah.

315
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,560
So he's looking at, I can understand what William Lin is looking at.

316
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,880
The majority leader of the Senate is telling him, I want you to, you know, a very nice

317
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,360
letter, the letter has been posted on the internet.

318
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,320
So very nice letter saying, well, we have reason that we need to do this, etc., etc.

319
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,320
And Lin didn't buy it because that wasn't an official channel for how you create a SAP,

320
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,160
a program that's already TSSEI and elevated up to a SAP.

321
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,520
There's a whole process, procedure, bureaucracy and red tape that you have to go through.

322
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,560
And Harry was using political muscle to bypass all that.

323
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,680
And the executive branch is taught or trained not to do that.

324
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,920
Capitol Hill is not their taskmaster.

325
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,680
The taskmaster is the president of the United States, the commander in chief, the head of

326
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,560
the executive branch.

327
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,600
Now, who was the president at that?

328
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,160
It was Bush.

329
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:48,600
So George W. Bush, if Harry Reid had written the letter to Bush or actually met him face

330
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,360
to face, which would have been far more effective.

331
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,560
I don't know how possible it would have been, but it would have been had a much higher chance

332
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:02,680
that Bush would call down to William Lin or he would have maybe his national security

333
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,640
advisor, Stephen Hadley, call the secretary of defense's office, actually.

334
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,200
And maybe the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security and say,

335
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,640
okay, there's this program I wanted to get a SAP.

336
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,040
Sure.

337
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,240
And if the president says I want a SAP, they're going to have to SAP it.

338
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,640
And Luis Elizondo's book, he specifically mentions how they went to

339
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:35,080
see if they could get inside this program and have some of this material.

340
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,240
And they were pretty much, you know, blocked out by the program manager.

341
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,000
And of course, the red tape.

342
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,520
Glenn Gaffney was the director of the funds.

343
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,960
Yeah, he was the director.

344
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:52,600
I think his title was deputy director of the CIA over the directorate of science and technology.

345
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,920
That's where the UFO or the UAP portfolio was held.

346
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,840
So he's the portfolio owner at the time he was there.

347
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,080
So I guess maybe his title is deputy director of science and technology.

348
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,640
It depends on how they organize it.

349
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:07,880
Yeah.

350
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,520
These days.

351
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,640
But anyway, that's what he ran that directorate.

352
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,000
So he just stepped in the middle and just said, absolutely not.

353
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,120
We're not going to do that.

354
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:22,280
I wonder, HW, former director of CIA, do you think it stands to reason that HW might have

355
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,560
known more than many other modern presidents by virtue of this?

356
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,680
I had conversations with him back in 2003.

357
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:37,480
And what he learned, he was not briefed as a president on this subject.

358
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,720
He was briefed as an incoming CIA director.

359
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,680
Not surprised.

360
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,960
And that's all he had on it.

361
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,200
When he became president, he didn't hear about it anymore.

362
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,680
When he was the CIA director, he was given some pretty spectacular information.

363
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,040
And he insisted that he wanted to see that.

364
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,800
This is DOD information.

365
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:02,280
What's funny is that his agency was the portfolio for UAPs.

366
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:10,760
So even he wasn't told who in the CIA was running it for him to get briefed by, for

367
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,400
him to call on his phone and say, I need you to brief me.

368
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,160
He wasn't told.

369
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,840
Instead, it was the Pentagon liaison officer who had no intention on briefing him about

370
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,520
UFOs or UAPs.

371
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:28,840
And instead, he assumed that Bush had already been briefed by his CIA personnel or his

372
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,480
leadership who oversee that portfolio.

373
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,560
And he accidentally assumed that.

374
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:42,120
He started rattling off about a major UAP event that took place in the early 60s.

375
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,800
And Bush's eyes lit up.

376
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,680
And this is what he's told me.

377
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,360
He said, what are you talking about?

378
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,600
So the Pentagon liaison officer told him all about it.

379
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,960
And he said, are you kidding me?

380
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,920
There's a there there.

381
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,000
And he said, absolutely.

382
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,680
And he said, well, I want to see the evidence.

383
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:06,120
And the evidence was in the form of a film and some documentation, reports or something.

384
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,960
But the film was the primary thing.

385
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,280
And he was declined.

386
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:17,000
The liaison officer said, no, you don't have a need to know because this is DOD intelligence.

387
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,880
And we're not going to give it to you.

388
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,800
Only if there's an event that happens that requires you to take that information up to

389
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,560
the president and the national security.

390
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,240
Actually, go to the national security advisor.

391
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,320
He's the clearinghouse for all things UAP.

392
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,440
So you go to the national, the president's national security advisor, and you say,

393
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,840
my agency just had a major event that we collected intelligence on.

394
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,680
And it's going to require a presidential decision.

395
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,760
And the national security advisor is going to have to say, okay, here's a number in your

396
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,400
agency who you're going to call to get a full briefing on the whole UFO thing.

397
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,800
And meanwhile, I will schedule a meeting in the Oval Office with the president for each.

398
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,160
That's how that works.

399
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,920
And I think the PED documents could possibly emerge from that.

400
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:06,520
If it's a historical thing, no, that historical event might already be covered by a PED.

401
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,920
And that's probably why that guy, that briefing officer, the liaison officer from the Pentagon

402
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,280
actually slipped up by wrongly assuming that Bush was already briefed.

403
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,520
The fact is, yes, you can brief the PED within the executive branch,

404
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,240
but he assumed that Bush had been and he hadn't been.

405
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,960
So my guess is that since that was not a new event, it was an old historical event,

406
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,120
that there would be no need to brief Bush on the PED that was involved.

407
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,080
So he would never know.

408
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,320
He would just hear about the evidence that recorded that event happening.

409
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,920
And it happened at a military base.

410
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,960
And so there you go.

411
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,160
And speaking of those PEDs, yesterday you also made some super interesting comments

412
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,840
on kind of private contracts.

413
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,840
Specifically, I think you said source contract.

414
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,640
It's all source.

415
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,360
Instead of putting out a project for a contract bid.

416
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,560
An RFP.

417
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,880
Yeah, you have to have to issue either a broad area announcement, which is how

418
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,200
Bigelero Space applied to submit a bid for the OSAP contract.

419
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,120
So it's either a request for proposals or a broad area announcement.

420
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,160
And if you do that, then you're going to severely compromise the security of an SAP.

421
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,360
So they don't do that.

422
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,880
You don't invite different companies to see the specs of the program,

423
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,600
the outline and the specs and the deliverables expected

424
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,960
over the period of performance expected in the RFP or the BAA.

425
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,160
Instead, the government agency has the contract guy and the program manager guy

426
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,640
and maybe one other authority over all that.

427
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,000
They're going to call up their favorite contractor who they know or believe

428
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,400
could successfully execute the project.

429
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,520
And they'll say, okay, we want to give you a contract.

430
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,440
Here's how much money and here's how many years we're going to pay up.

431
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,600
And the company's stupid.

432
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,720
They'll say no.

433
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,480
If the company's smart, they'll say yes.

434
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:06,760
And generally, the Beltway bandits and the legacy aerospace industry are not stupid.

435
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,640
They need money, so they will always say yes.

436
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,760
Would those be authorized contracts then or have a transfer of authority?

437
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,600
Those sole source contracts?

438
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,560
Would they be traceable?

439
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,040
No, usually they set up a front company to pass the money through.

440
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,640
So this roster of kind of the big defense contractors for these big projects,

441
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,560
would that roster be pretty thin?

442
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,680
Only a couple entries there?

443
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,880
And I don't know.

444
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,080
I do know from the aerospace company that I interacted with quite frequently during the OSAP.

445
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,580
Yeah.

446
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,440
They didn't go to the government customer.

447
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,160
It wasn't always the CIA.

448
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,440
It was Air Force at times.

449
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,200
So I think the money is transmitted through a pass-through company.

450
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,800
But they know very well who their government customer is.

451
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,000
The government customer knows very well who they are and that they have a contract.

452
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,440
So I think the fact that the money goes through a hard-to-audit channel

453
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,560
doesn't prevent the two from talking.

454
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,080
Because the program does get contract monitoring

455
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,840
and contract oversight from the government customer.

456
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,920
So they will exert that authority over them.

457
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,240
I wanted to ask you about Dave Grush's IRAD fraud allegations.

458
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,720
You recall what he talks about in Congress.

459
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,080
He alleged that at least one contract, and I believe

460
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,160
Elizondo repeated it in his House hearing.

461
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,040
The allegation was made that at some point in time, for some duration,

462
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:35,000
a contractor artificially inflated the proposal budget for a black budget program

463
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,080
so that they could siphon that money off into IRAD to do an IRAD project.

464
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,240
Because frequently you can tax deduct the funding from the profit dollars and move them.

465
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,200
And instead of just hoping they overperform, they like doctor the situation so that they

466
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,400
definitely overperform.

467
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,160
Then the extra money was sort of moved into this.

468
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,680
Okay. I don't have any insights on that.

469
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,080
Okay.

470
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,580
Okay.

471
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,440
There are two types of contracts.

472
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,680
It's either cost plus fee or fixed cost, fixed firm price.

473
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,040
Yeah. So those are the only contract vehicles I'm aware of.

474
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,720
I'm not aware that there's anything special just because of UAPs.

475
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,760
So it's either cost plus or firm cost, fixed price.

476
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,260
Sure.

477
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,840
One of those is how NASA tends to issue contracts,

478
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,240
like Artemis is way over budget, over schedule,

479
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,800
and the Orion heat shield did the same thing to the Orion.

480
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:33,320
Boeing has become a disaster with the CST-100 or the Starliner.

481
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,920
Yes. So that is under cost plus.

482
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,880
Right. Right.

483
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,440
And that's where the government gets screwed on.

484
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,440
So I have no idea what contract vehicles are used for UAPs.

485
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,160
It's like now you're down in the weeds and it really doesn't matter.

486
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,440
Sure. Sure.

487
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,760
Speaking of these sort of corporate entities here,

488
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:58,520
people are sort of aware that, okay, maybe they have their groups

489
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,960
to do the work in engineering, to do the material analysis,

490
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,720
what have you in their programs.

491
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:10,520
But is there any merit to there being private strike teams

492
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,520
who are having their own contested crash recovery,

493
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,720
coverings with the public strike teams?

494
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,960
No, I'm not familiar with any.

495
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,320
I haven't heard any such thing.

496
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,080
Even out in the open, even in the classified venue, I haven't heard.

497
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,560
There's a story of apparently a private military contractor,

498
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,840
contracted by Lockheed Martin, sent out to recover a crash.

499
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,880
The JSOC team sent out to the same crash site

500
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,800
and there apparently being exchange of fire and case.

501
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,920
And clearly this would generate a lot of paper, right?

502
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,080
Well, I'm not familiar with that incident.

503
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,080
So all this talk about private contractors,

504
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,560
the big Lockheed Martin, what about federally funded research

505
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,400
and development centers such as MITRE, RAND, Triad, Oak Ridge,

506
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,280
and UARCs, University Affiliated Research Centers?

507
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,800
Where do they fall into this?

508
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:06,840
Only one, and I won't name it, started out as a contractor in the 1960s.

509
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,920
Not too long after it was born, it was actually a spinoff of TRW.

510
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,600
So TRW was the principal investigator for the first,

511
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,120
roughly, what, almost 30, yeah, practically, what, 29 years.

512
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,920
But I know that another company would dispute that.

513
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,480
They thought they were a principal contractor.

514
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,560
In fact, the principal contractor served a leadership role

515
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:38,040
that the other companies kind of, they don't know what's going on,

516
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,680
but they know who's involved at the, you know, the scuttle,

517
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
the scuttle, you know, scuttle-bet level.

518
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,920
And so they know at the scuttle-bet level through communications

519
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,760
with the government customer, who else would be involved?

520
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,680
But they don't have direct communications with those other

521
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,920
companies because of compartmentalization.

522
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,560
So I do know that there'd be a dispute because there was, I mean,

523
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,880
the senior VP of the company I interacted with during the OSAP with that.

524
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,960
Well, we had the program running and they didn't consider somebody else

525
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,600
as the principal investigator.

526
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,160
I think that they would know that.

527
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,840
The government customer knows that.

528
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,040
So I think that's where the misunderstanding was occurring,

529
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,480
is down at the company level.

530
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,360
So yeah, the only FFRDC I know of is the one that spinoff of TRW.

531
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,920
My recollection from the senior vice president of the other company

532
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,280
is that they kind of left that whole line of work at some point

533
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,640
just because I think they did all they could do.

534
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:50,440
And so they got out of it somewhere maybe 10 or a little more years

535
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,120
after they got started on it.

536
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,600
So probably in the early 70s is when they left it.

537
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,400
And then we had the other legacy firms that were involved.

538
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,680
So there were four overall.

539
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,280
That would make sense because a lot of the FFRDCs that were started kind of

540
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,280
were born out of the early 60s, late 50s,

541
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
and kind of fulfilled their purpose within 10 years

542
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
and then moved on to other projects.

543
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,480
Like RAND, for example, started off as Project RAND.

544
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,080
And just speaking of what you know and what you don't know,

545
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,520
one of the things you kind of definitively said during your talk up there

546
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,720
was that there are no ARVs or alien reproduction vehicles.

547
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,680
And so I think that's really kind of a bombshell

548
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,680
because there are so many theories out there like,

549
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,360
oh, this incident or that incident.

550
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,440
Well, I know.

551
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,720
But, you know, I can kind of take their word for it

552
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,200
because we've barely scratched the surface of how they even.

553
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,840
Yeah.

554
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,280
So I have some questions about this.

555
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,160
So like, do you think anything's happened recently maybe,

556
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:51,240
like in the last like 10 years that's real new, like advancement, like progress?

557
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,920
I'm not aware of it because I'm out of it now.

558
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,160
Sure.

559
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,040
I've been out of it since the Ashes, the age it ended.

560
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,840
So I'm not right into it.

561
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:06,120
At the level I was for the ASAP and ATIP purposes,

562
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:07,880
I don't know.

563
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,360
All I do know is I was given a firm.

564
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,720
Hey, in 1989, the CIA shut it all down because nobody,

565
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,160
us and we know the other companies that we had been found out from our customer

566
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,040
didn't make any progress after several decades of investigating.

567
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,400
There was no progress made.

568
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,560
So I said, so what's the story about

569
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,840
Northrop Grumman having an ARV or somebody out in Area 51 having an ARV?

570
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,240
And he said, oh, that's all myth.

571
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,080
He said the people that had been putting out there

572
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,440
don't know what the hell they're talking about.

573
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,040
And they don't know why unless they're just another Bob Lazar type.

574
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,000
They're just going to, they're long on the tooth and they're going to tell a story.

575
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,480
Yeah.

576
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,840
Is there any chance that was disinformation or that was passage material?

577
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,680
No, actually it wasn't disinformation.

578
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,360
It was even Bob Lazar's information is disinformation.

579
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,920
It's because they believe their own bullshit.

580
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,000
I mean that they were telling you that there's no ARVs.

581
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,480
We've made no...

582
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,760
Oh, no, that's not disinformation.

583
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,640
You know, that's coming straight on a classified level with me having the need to know.

584
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,800
And they don't have a need to give me this information.

585
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,240
We're on a program and we're going to give them contract money to work with us.

586
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,400
And they're not going to sit there and bullshit with us.

587
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,160
Wait, we're going to give them money.

588
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,960
I don't think so.

589
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,240
It's way too 5D chess.

590
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,080
When you're saying ARV, do you mean like a one-to-one recreation of a UAP and NHI vehicle?

591
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,520
Or do you think there's aircraft systems that have kind of leveraged technologies?

592
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,560
Definitely no aircraft systems that have leveraged anything.

593
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,200
And there's been no one-to-one reproduction.

594
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:37,240
A lot of that fell into the psyche of the UFO community because of Bob Lazar

595
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,520
and then Brad Sorensen and Mark McCandless.

596
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,480
So I don't know where they're coming from.

597
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,240
And then other people kind of came out of the woodwork saying the same thing,

598
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,760
but no proof.

599
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,520
I mean, there's been photographs, but those photographs, I haven't analyzed them.

600
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,000
I don't remember if Bruce Maccabee looked at them.

601
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,360
I know Bruce Maccabee had only said they definitely looked like hoaxes to him,

602
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,480
but I don't think he ever issued a report on them because he's got lots of reports on UAPs

603
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,480
that he has done photo and film and video analysis of.

604
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,520
Have you ever spoken to the Brad Sorensen and McCandless?

605
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,240
No, I have.

606
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,360
I've put off asking.

607
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,800
What do you think about adversarial governments having

608
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,040
functional vehicles that they've...

609
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,440
Okay, if they do, then basically, why are we still a country?

610
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,560
Why haven't we been conquered?

611
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,320
And especially if it's an adversarial government with the resources,

612
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,360
because there are adversarial governments that don't have the resources.

613
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,880
That'd be North Korea, Iran, and probably a few others,

614
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,360
but the big ones would be China and Russia.

615
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,240
Well, suppose it's still...

616
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,960
Yeah, right now, they're still playing with conventional propulsion like hypersonic missiles,

617
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:57,160
supersonic missiles, subsonic missiles, multiple munitions, multiple warheads, et cetera, et cetera.

618
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,520
Nobody's got an ARV type crap zipping over Ukraine,

619
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,400
and Ukraine certainly hasn't been reporting any such things of that nature,

620
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,280
and they would have.

621
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,840
They would have screamed bloody murder and taken it straight to the President of the United States,

622
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,080
the CIA, the Department of State would have said,

623
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,080
here's our photographs, and here's our recordings of it.

624
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,720
And look, there's a Russian symbol on it.

625
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,240
And so, no, that hasn't happened.

626
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,040
I mean, if it was for real, we would see a dramatic change in the balance of power.

627
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:38,200
The United States, our intelligence agency would probably have known about it before

628
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,520
Ukraine would have gotten hit in such a hypothetical story or scenario,

629
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,200
and that just hasn't happened.

630
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,600
So, they haven't been successful.

631
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
I can't believe they're any more successful than we do.

632
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,040
You do agree with Grush's contention that they have programs, they have wreckage,

633
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,480
they have technology that they're...

634
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,760
China is like a closed door.

635
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,160
I know through how put up that they have at least one,

636
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,320
and I think he might have gotten that officially through some work he did with the DIA,

637
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,120
where he did go to China for them, but not for that reason,

638
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,720
and he's probably learned something over there.

639
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,600
I think there's other sources that have said similar.

640
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,000
Probably Dave Grush has more information on that than even I thought to ask him about.

641
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,800
But Russia is one that had some crash retrievals,

642
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,360
and that's been released when the Soviet Union fell,

643
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,160
KGB opened up the files, George Knapp went there,

644
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,880
other people went there, found the Thread 3 documents.

645
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,760
And I had independent, and I can't get into this because it's still super classified,

646
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,120
but through the OSAP program, I had a connection in with a three-letter agency that collected

647
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:45,800
not from the KGB open records, they collected it from their own asset,

648
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:52,360
and the asset was was filtering out actual legitimate documents, photos,

649
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,840
reports, technical and operational and executive summary type.

650
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,560
There's enough evidence that I saw in classified setting that convinced me that they have it.

651
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,040
At least for quite some time.

652
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,280
Crash retrieval, yeah.

653
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,640
I can't say that it would go back to the 40s, 50s, or 60s, or 70s.

654
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,840
I know I was at the end of the 80s was the one I was exposed to.

655
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,920
So they have had something, and they've got hardware,

656
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,880
but I don't see that they've been any successful.

657
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,000
It's not holding up.

658
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Are there any other breadcrumbs that you gave to Dave Grush that might be useful to us from

659
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,520
kind of like an open source intelligence perspective that we could start to follow

660
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,400
and kind of pick up and-

661
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,000
Oh, boy, this is really super, it's classified still.

662
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,840
The breadcrumbs I gave him are proprietary to NIDS and BAS,

663
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:47,480
Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies, and classified to the DIA and another three-letter

664
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,080
agency. That made me two.

665
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,000
I need to wait for a couple of people at the corporate level to die of old age.

666
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,920
And when they do that, I won't have trouble with lawyers,

667
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,120
and then I'll come out with a book.

668
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,240
Now, the classified stuff in that, I don't know what I'm going to do with that.

669
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,440
That's classified for life.

670
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:03,480
Yeah.

671
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:11,560
So they can declassify it up to 25 years, but I've had so much derivative classification training

672
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,480
that I found out that the rules for declassification are,

673
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,840
do include the ability to maintain classification up to even 75 years.

674
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,840
So BAS has to maintain that classification for 75 years.

675
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,160
Wow.

676
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,640
So if you sincerely can justify that you can't declassify after 25 years,

677
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,640
75 seems to be the maximum.

678
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,960
How did your perspective change on what viable approaches were to break through

679
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,800
propulsion physics from when you started it to when you end, when you finish the project?

680
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,520
What did you initially think was interesting that you threw away,

681
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,280
and then what sort of came to the floor from it?

682
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:53,640
Well, what got thrown away is those concepts that don't meet the criteria for novel disruptive

683
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,680
innovation or testable or theoretically well-defined concepts.

684
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:05,800
People come to you or came to us and others with all kinds of inventions and ideas,

685
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,240
like the Searle effect, the Dean drive, those kinds of things,

686
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,960
space-time torsion.

687
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:20,840
And torsion, for your viewers, is basically just a defect or crack or fissure in the space-time

688
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,800
continuum.

689
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,600
And Einstein looked at that and it looked like the issue of, well, if you're going to have a

690
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,400
path of a particle undergoing motion through space-time and it's going to encounter this,

691
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,680
what's the gravitational or space-time curvature manifestations of coming into that crack,

692
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,960
going around it?

693
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,840
What does it do to you if you go around it or can you go across it?

694
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:48,120
What are the physics consequences of doing that from within general relativity?

695
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,160
So Einstein looked at all that and he was trying to find out if torsion might give you

696
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,240
a prescription to describe elementary particle spin.

697
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,120
And he found out that was not the case.

698
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:09,640
So he also found out that torsion does not produce testable predictions that we have observed.

699
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:14,200
And it actually produces or predicts inconsistent results.

700
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,320
And so he ended up tossing away torsion saying, you know, it's a great theoretical

701
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:27,960
concept to look at, but it doesn't hold water because it makes the general relativistic

702
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,720
field equations inconsistent.

703
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,320
So it loses its self-consistency.

704
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,960
It'll make wrong predictions of phenomena already observed.

705
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,680
And it's just not refined enough.

706
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,680
There's just something missing from it.

707
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,320
And it cannot definitely be used to describe particle spin, whether it be macroscopic

708
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,240
particles or quantum particles.

709
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,960
It just didn't reach that threshold.

710
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,080
So Ringamacher actually did an experiment, and I'm not going to get into it because I

711
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,000
don't remember enough of it anymore.

712
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,760
And he did an experiment that was specifically designed to test whether torsion existed in

713
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,720
space-time.

714
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,400
And it was a well thought out apparatus, very well designed.

715
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,920
They did it at General Electric.

716
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:18,520
So they had a staff of physicists and engineers to help do the prediction on what such an

717
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,840
instrument would be like and how it would function and how you would design it and build

718
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,160
it.

719
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:29,800
So they did it just like Kip Thorne and the big giant team that formed LIGO did when

720
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,240
they got started looking at gravitational wave detectors in the 1970s.

721
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,680
And he got an old result.

722
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,160
Basically, he couldn't find any sign of any space-time torsion.

723
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,760
And so at least at that level, it was a thorough enough type of experiment.

724
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,840
It's just like what Gary Nolan said.

725
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,520
It was data.

726
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:53,320
And then the data formed the evidence, and then you interpret it in the context of the

727
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,120
hypothesis, and then you form your conclusion.

728
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:02,360
And the conclusion was, we don't see space-time torsion, so it must not exist, at least at

729
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,160
that level.

730
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,280
That doesn't close the door on torsion because there could be other experiments.

731
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,360
Somebody can think of some other formulas.

732
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,200
That's right.

733
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,600
But unfortunately, we haven't seen that happen yet.

734
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:18,600
And the interesting thing is that, like I said, as we go back to general relativity,

735
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,840
and Einstein messing with that when he was developing the general theory of relativity

736
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:28,920
and its 16 field equations, it starts out as 256 field equations.

737
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,720
But due to symmetry properties, you can knock them down to 16.

738
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,200
And I think a couple more will bring it down to 10.

739
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:39,160
So 10 field equations, and it just basically gets you inconsistent results.

740
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,440
And that's a problem.

741
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,560
So it's telling you already that you're not going to get right answers by incorporating

742
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:50,200
torsion, and that's a problem because that means you're trying to develop a physics that

743
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,400
produces a testable prediction that, when you observe them, you're not going to just

744
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,920
observe new predictions.

745
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,760
You want to observe old predictions just to make sure the theory is still correct,

746
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,160
because it's not a predict the old stuff that have been observed, old phenomenon.

747
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,280
And it didn't do that.

748
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,360
It just gave you wrong answers all the way around.

749
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,000
Yeah.

750
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,960
Now, when you talk about like the nth order differential equations associated with GR,

751
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,880
and you get 256 equations that only simplify due to symmetries, what is your perspective

752
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,000
on the approach to like mathematical beauty in physics?

753
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,320
I mean, do you insist or do you have a notion that the theory of everything or the gut will

754
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,520
turn out to be elegant?

755
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:35,720
Or do you sort of think it might be clumsy and clunky and, you know, 19,000 equations?

756
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,480
I mean, do you have any perspective on that?

757
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,520
With regard to what?

758
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,560
A unified field theory?

759
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,160
Yes, with respect to each other?

760
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,840
I don't think it's...

761
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:51,240
Yeah, no, I'm in the camp of physicists that we already know and a lot of other physicists

762
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,960
know that Einstein proved that gravity is not a fundamental force of nature.

763
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:01,320
It emerges from the fabric of space-time when it's distorted or curved or bent.

764
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:06,600
And Sakharov, he believed that the metric elasticity of space described by the space-time

765
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:12,680
metric, which is just a very simple equation actually, and he said that should come from

766
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,400
the quantum vacuum fluctuations because he sees the quantum vacuum fluctuations as being

767
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,760
the seed of all existence.

768
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,480
And he was right.

769
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,880
Basically, that started from Richard Feynman when he got the Nobel Prize for the quantum

770
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,400
electrodynamics theory.

771
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,560
And then later on, when that got unified with the weak nuclear force, it became the

772
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,400
electroweak theory.

773
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,360
Separately, we have quantum chromodynamic theory, which describes the theory overseeing

774
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,920
the strong nuclear force, which basically emerges from quark or quantum thermodynamics

775
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,760
or the interaction between quarks and gluons, gluons being the photons of the strong nuclear

776
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,640
force.

777
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,520
They have instead of...

778
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,000
They don't have a mass, they move at the speed of light, they have a spin one just

779
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,960
like a photon does.

780
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,000
But unlike a photon, they have three color charges, or it can have a combination of those

781
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,320
color...

782
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,160
Actually, they have two color charges.

783
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:07,080
So they have a combination of color charges, which are a symmetry property of the theory.

784
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,600
They're not an actual...

785
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,200
They're not an electric charge, really.

786
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,640
They actually have no electric charge.

787
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,400
Generally can't be separated.

788
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:13,880
Is that right?

789
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,000
You can't get color charged particles in terms of pulling them apart, popping them apart.

790
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,920
You can, but inside the hadrons, you can.

791
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,400
But when you have high energy collisions, like what happened at the relativistic heavy

792
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:31,000
ion collider at Brookhaven National Lab, for a brief instant, or just an instant long enough

793
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,560
that you can measure it, you can pull the quarks out of the hadrons, they'll be mixed

794
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,640
in with the gluons, and you will actually produce quark gluon plasmas.

795
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,560
And the plasmas will exist as an entity.

796
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:49,640
I don't want to say a soliton, but as an entity on its own, and it's outside of the elementary

797
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,120
particle from which it was created.

798
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:59,880
The collider is colliding heavy atoms, usually uranium, lead, iron, even protons.

799
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,120
Yeah, at 99.9996% the speed of light.

800
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,960
And so there's enough energy, centered mass energy, in there in the relativistic

801
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,360
reference frame that you can literally blow those hadrons apart.

802
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,960
A hadron is basically two classes, mesons and baryons.

803
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,520
And of the baryons, there's protons and neutrons.

804
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,720
So basically, you're looking at the heavy nuclei of these ions, so you strip the electrons

805
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:29,640
off, and you're going to have these super heavy uranium or iron or lead, or gold and

806
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:35,080
silver and other ones, and even as light as a single proton for hydrogen atom nucleus.

807
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,280
And they smash these things together, and you're liberating literally the quarks right

808
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,840
out of those protons, and then the heavier atoms out of all the protons and neutrons,

809
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,320
they get bashed into each other at really high energy.

810
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,280
And so that's an example of when that happens.

811
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,440
So QCD theory is not complementary or compatible with electroweak theory.

812
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,560
They cannot be unified.

813
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:01,800
That was a dream, that was a projection, an extrapolation, and has not come to fruition.

814
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,520
Likewise, gravity is not a force of nature.

815
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:09,560
It emerges from space-time phenomenon, the space-time manifold or the continuum,

816
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,240
however you want to describe it.

817
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,960
And it's a coupling constant measures the strength of the interaction force between

818
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,760
particles.

819
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:22,040
So for the quantum electrodynamics, that's the electromagnetic fine structure constant.

820
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:26,760
Then for electroweak theory, well, now that's blended in with the weak nuclear force.

821
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,920
The weak force is responsible for the decay of quarks in high-energy quarks,

822
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,360
the low-energy quarks.

823
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:37,400
Radioactive decay is another one, where atoms transmute and decay away, and elementary

824
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,360
particles are emitted, or even alpha particles, which are helium nucleus, are emitted.

825
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,880
So that's what the weak force is.

826
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,440
It turns out they're both two sides of the same coin.

827
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,800
Of the same unified force.

828
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:53,000
Well, its coupling constant is actually the electromagnetic fine structure constant divided

829
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,640
by 100 times the proton mass squared.

830
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,720
So it's scaled to the proton mass.

831
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,880
So then when you're talking about gravity, gravity's coupling constant.

832
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,480
The first two I mentioned have known dimensions.

833
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,440
The coupling constant in general relativity is the universal gravitational constant times

834
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,000
8 pi divided by the speed of light to the fourth power.

835
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,600
You know what the units of that are?

836
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,960
One over force.

837
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,760
One over newtons.

838
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,480
That's right.

839
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,800
And that's a coupling constant to convert the

840
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,120
dimensional units of the stress energy tension, which is the source of spacetime curvature.

841
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:30,760
That's in units of joules per cubic meter, or energy density, or pressure,

842
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,480
because an equivalent is newtons per square meter.

843
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,640
Okay, so those have to be converted using that one over newton factor

844
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,840
from the coupling constant into units of one over meter squared.

845
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,520
That's how you measure spacetime curvature on the left side of the field equation.

846
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:50,120
That has the Ritchie curvature tensor and the Ritchie scalar multiplied by the metric tensor

847
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:50,840
and one half.

848
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,760
And they take this difference between the two.

849
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:58,920
For that reason, we know we really can't unify those two forces.

850
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,880
It's really electroweak and quantum chromodynamics.

851
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,760
We can't unify it to spacetime curvature model.

852
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,840
And everybody's still attacking quantum superstring.

853
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:13,880
It's kind of died away because it can't make useful predictions or testable predictions.

854
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,960
However, it's been very successful in mathematics and geometry and topology.

855
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,840
They have predicted a lot of new things in those areas,

856
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,920
but they're still hacking away at trying to get it to work as a quantum gravity theory.

857
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,920
Same thing with quantum loop gravity.

858
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:34,040
And gosh, Roger Penrose had the most sexy version of quantum gravity

859
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,200
that I fell in love with when I was in graduate school.

860
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,040
And it came out, it was twister theory.

861
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,200
So he replaced the whole concept with a whole new,

862
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,960
instead of a four-dimensional spacetime point of x, y, z, and a t,

863
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,000
or a different coordinate system, but you always have a time in there.

864
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:53,080
And instead, he was looking at energy, momentum as a four vector

865
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,080
to describe an event in spacetime.

866
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,200
So we wanted to build an edifice of an algebra that handled that,

867
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,760
then a geometry that that algebra builds up.

868
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,480
And from that, he was hoping to get a unified picture of the forces of nature and gravity.

869
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,080
And it was beautiful.

870
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,960
Again, like super string theory, great, beautiful mathematical results came out.

871
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,000
It's geometrical.

872
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,520
Oh my gosh, this thing is an exercise of the most advanced version of complex math.

873
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,800
You've seen complex math when you were in aerospace engineering,

874
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,760
so it just didn't go anywhere in predicting.

875
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,040
It just didn't give you anything useful.

876
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,400
So basically, we can't see a unified field theory coming out of that.

877
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,560
Well, Dr. Davis, thank you so much for sitting down with us.

878
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,320
It's been incredibly revelatory.

879
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,880
And we're so glad you came this year to give a talk at Seoul.

880
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,600
We hope we see you back.

881
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,800
Oh, yeah. Thank you very much.

882
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,520
Yeah, absolutely.

883
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,000
See you, Jack.

884
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,520
Yeah, you're both in the tree.

885
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,160
Thank you, sir.

886
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:41,720
You're welcome.

887
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,000
We'll wait another 14 years this year.
