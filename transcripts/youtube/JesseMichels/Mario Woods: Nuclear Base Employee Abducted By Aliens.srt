1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,180
And as we turned left on the, not a hard left, just a dog leg left, there sat this object

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,480
on top of November 5 that was about 10 feet in the air, directly on top of that blast

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,200
door that was the size of a Walmart building.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,840
It was huge and it was a sphere.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,600
I sat down with Mario Woods, a former U.S. Air Force security responder.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,440
In 1977, he was stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:36,980
Then, aged 23, he experienced an incident that would change him forever, literally leaving

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:43,160
him with missing time, marks on his body, and a collie locked in catatonic shock for

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,160
hours.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,840
Literally could not get a breath of air.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,060
It was just all-encompassing.

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:57,900
So here it is, my full interview with Mario Woods.

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,220
So who are you?

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,220
Hello.

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,220
My name is Mario Woods.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,300
I currently live in Southeast Georgia.

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,660
I'm 69 years old.

18
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:15,340
I served in the Air Force from 1975 to 1983 and in 1977 had quite the experience on November

19
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:24,140
was a Minuteman II, 1.2 megaton weapon in the ground, in a hardened structure, in a

20
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:32,620
silo just north of a small town named Newell, South Dakota, which is 30 miles north of Sturges,

21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,020
which most people have heard before.

22
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:44,700
This is a High Plains area, a buffalo running terrain, seen them a few times also.

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:54,220
One o'clock in the morning changed my life at week of November, we say 18th in 1977.

24
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,180
And you were stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base?

25
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,940
At Ellsworth Air Force Base, that's correct.

26
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,940
And what was your role there?

27
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,240
What were you doing?

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,060
Security police, assigned to the missile squadron.

29
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:12,180
You have about 800 security police officers that work the site and about one-third are

30
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,780
assigned to aircraft back at the main support base of Ellsworth, the actual Air Force Base.

31
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,940
All the missile sites themselves are manned by six-man teams and there are 150 Minuteman

32
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:30,900
II missiles with 15 launch control facilities is where you live and you act as a response

33
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:38,720
team while on duty on a 12-hour shift to respond to any and all given alarms or launch facility

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,880
checks or anything that an ordinary police type duty would be.

35
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,040
Not for our sake, but for the context of the audience, do you have any mental health history

36
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,200
prior to your sighting in 1977, your experience in 1977?

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
No I do not.

38
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,280
I was part of the personal reliability program also for sensitive nuclear equipment.

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,800
Can you explain what that is?

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,520
Yeah, anyone that works around any type of nuclear devices, weaponry or construction

41
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:16,040
of or the storage of nuclear components, whatever it may be, plutonium, uranium or anything

42
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:23,700
that's used in that particular field, you have to be cleared and granted a clearance

43
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,700
in order to do it.

44
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,720
If they detect anything that's abnormal with how you may react up to and including

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:37,440
life if you have to in preservation of keeping that ours or saving someone's life.

46
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,600
They really analyze you deeply to see if you can't do that.

47
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,040
And you have to report if you're taking any sort of medication or any sort of diagnoses

48
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,000
in the past dealing with mental health.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Correct.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
They do random blood tests, urinalysis, everything.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,200
We didn't have gum swabs back then or the tests were quite different back in that day,

52
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,800
but there was no leniency in that.

53
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:12,400
Okay, so you're in Ellsworth Air Force Base, it's 1977, you have a partner that you're

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
working with?

55
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,880
Yeah, his name is Michael Johnson, he's a real light-skinned black guy.

56
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,240
He told me he was from Chicago, Illinois, and we only worked together that one day.

57
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,760
He was working vacation relief for my partner whose name was Steve Welchel, who went to

58
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,480
North Carolina to get married.

59
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,040
So he had 30 days in which to do that.

60
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,120
So in the interim, while we went on a tour into the field, mind you, your main base is

61
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,920
Ellsworth and you report there are SATAF, our operations facility, is at Ellsworth.

62
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:48,360
And all the three squadrons meet there for this huge guard mount as we depart from there

63
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,260
on buses or helicopters if the weather's too bad and they can't travel on the road.

64
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,020
And we go out to our respective launch control facilities where we live for three days at

65
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,140
a time and come in the morning of the fourth day.

66
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,100
So set the scene for the night in question, what are you doing?

67
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,100
Really nothing.

68
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,780
We had gotten out there probably about 9.30, 10 o'clock in the morning.

69
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,860
Usually if you're working the night shift, which we were assigned to, which was 6 p.m.

70
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:21,700
to 6 a.m., we try to lay down and take a nap, but you know, that young and strong and vibrant

71
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,220
I didn't really see the need to do that.

72
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,380
So during the day, I just stayed up and did some other things, played some ping pong or

73
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,380
something and that night we went on duty at 6 p.m.

74
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,580
Of course, we go in and we get all of our code tables issued to us and all that stuff.

75
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,740
Or when we're dispatched, it can be either or.

76
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:49,660
And I guess it was about 9 o'clock, 9.15 or so.

77
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,660
I smoked cigarettes then, so I just thought I'd walk outside and have a cigarette and

78
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,740
it was between 9 and 13 degrees outside.

79
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,580
So I have my long johns on over my fatigues and I just walked outside and you know, you're

80
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,060
talking prairie land as far as you can see north and east and west and you don't see

81
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,780
south because the buildings behind you.

82
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:19,260
And I see this light off to my east at about a 30 degree angle and it looks like a mini

83
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
moon.

84
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:27,820
I honestly thought it was the landing lights or some type of landing lights for B-52 bombers

85
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:37,140
because the main base supported aircraft, uploaded aircraft of B-52s and they often

86
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:45,740
flew sorties or test runs across the prairies at night, usually around 300 feet.

87
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,780
So it was like a low level flight, right?

88
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,020
It was pretty cool to see that.

89
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,020
That's what I thought it was.

90
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,060
I thought they were coming to me.

91
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,620
That's why I couldn't really gauge the distance.

92
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,540
I mean, I thought five to seven miles and I'll stick with that at about 30 degrees,

93
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,500
but it never changed.

94
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,020
And I kept looking at it, looking at it.

95
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:13,300
Now, if I extended my hand this way, it covered the circumference of the light I was looking

96
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
at.

97
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,620
How far away was the object?

98
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,340
I would guess five to seven miles.

99
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:25,300
And the reason I say that is at the end of this, I can make that correlation because

100
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,020
you got to have things that put all this together.

101
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,220
And it was just so strange.

102
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,260
It was as if there was a light right out there a few miles away from you and you know it

103
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,380
doesn't belong there, but it's not coming near you and it's not going in either direction

104
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,020
anywhere else and there's no noise associated with it.

105
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,980
It just sits there.

106
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:51,380
So that's where I was with that and I'm smoking a cigarette and I thought, literally, I thought,

107
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,380
what the hell is that?

108
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,380
It can't be.

109
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,900
Is that B-52s or is it helicopters?

110
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,380
We did have helicopters back then, but I've never saw them fly at night like that.

111
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:09,060
So again, I just thought it was two B-52 bombers together so close, one behind and a wingman

112
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,180
like that that I just took it as that.

113
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,540
But I held my hand up like this and it covered the light, the circumference of the light.

114
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,780
But if I did my fist like this, then it was larger than my fist was.

115
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,420
And I thought that is really strange.

116
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,100
How can that be?

117
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,780
When I sailed with my father growing up, I went to sea with him a couple of times during

118
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,780
the summertime.

119
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,780
He could do that.

120
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,860
You can't do that today, but back then, you know, a chief engineer could do that.

121
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,180
I went inside the facility, went into the flight security controller office, which was

122
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,420
just right to the right as you open the front door.

123
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,780
And Bill Holloman, he was a staff sergeant and he was talking to his wife back at Ellsworth.

124
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:55,620
And the toggle switch or the rocker switch was on the wall just behind him, right next

125
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,420
to the entrance to the elevator door where the officers used to go down the elevator

126
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,420
to the capsule.

127
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,700
And I said, hey, Bill, I said, there's something out here strange in the air.

128
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,700
I said, some lights.

129
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,340
I said, do you mind if I flip the lights at this thing?

130
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,140
He just looked up at me literally and he had that big old gray phone back to his head.

131
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,780
And he just kind of waved me off, you know, like, go ahead, do what you want.

132
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,220
So I just honestly, no SOS or nothing.

133
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,220
I just flipped it off and on, off and on, off and on three times.

134
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:31,020
And I ran back outside and I was probably 20, 25 feet away from the door and just a

135
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,660
little bit to the east of it, of the door, of the front of the door.

136
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,380
And just watching it, a couple of minutes went by, maybe a minute and a half.

137
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:49,300
And all of a sudden this thing goes out, on, out, on, out and on, and it just sent shivers

138
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
up me.

139
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,900
And I went, wow, they do see me.

140
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,100
So I literally thought, okay, because I've had them do wing waves at me before like fighter

141
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,180
aircraft or helicopters, they'll do a little swing like that if they see you on the ground

142
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,220
and as security policeman, you're taught that.

143
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,460
You are taught hand signals and flashlight signals.

144
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,580
You know, for aircraft, if you need to be rescued or you're trying to aid them getting

145
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,220
to the ground or what have you, you know, you, you are trained on that.

146
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,700
So I just thought it was really cool and I thought, all right, well, let's carry this

147
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,700
on a little bit further.

148
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,180
Cause still it was in the same location, not coming closer, no sound.

149
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,540
So as I went in, I said, Hey, Michael, didn't know Michael from Adam's house cat.

150
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,820
It's the first time we ever worked together and he was just simply come out, sent out

151
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,460
to work vacation relief from my partner.

152
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,700
So I went and I said, Hey man, there's something in the air you need to come and look at.

153
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,540
And now he worked missiles also, but on a different flight.

154
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,100
He was usually at a different location.

155
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,580
He didn't work in November and he outranked me by two months, by the way.

156
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,580
So he would be driving the vehicle and I would be the passenger or the team member.

157
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,300
So he kind of looks at me for a minute and really is not too excited.

158
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,300
I said, come on out here, man.

159
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,980
You got to see this, hoping it would still be there when I went outside.

160
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,220
So he comes outside and I said, hold on right there.

161
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,500
We walked about 20, 25 feet and I said, look at that.

162
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
You see that?

163
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
He goes, yeah.

164
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,900
I said, I just flashed the lights at that thing and it flashed back at me.

165
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,820
And he just looked at me as in disbelief.

166
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,740
So I said, stay right here.

167
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,420
And I ran in there real fast and I said, Hey Bill, you got to come see this thing.

168
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,900
Cause he and I, we went back a ways and we knew each other pretty well.

169
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,940
And I don't know what kind of discussion he was in with his wife, but he chose not to

170
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,700
come out and stayed on that damn phone.

171
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,860
So I flipped the lights again, same sequence, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, three

172
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:43,020
of them three times, ran back outside about two minutes pass and it goes out, comes on,

173
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:49,580
goes out, comes on and stayed on twice, three and two.

174
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,740
That's right.

175
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,460
And uh, so he just kind of looked at me and looked back at that and I said, what do you

176
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,460
think man?

177
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,580
I don't know.

178
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,580
And I said, I'm going to do it again.

179
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,860
I'm going to do it again.

180
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,380
Maybe it'll, I said, do you hear anything?

181
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,540
Couldn't hear nothing.

182
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,580
He didn't hear anything.

183
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,980
He didn't seem to be too impressed.

184
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,860
I must say that he just, it didn't seem to really get ahold of him the way it did me.

185
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,940
I was excited about it.

186
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,100
Still not knowing what it was.

187
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,900
I said, it's got to, I said, it's got to be B 52s.

188
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
No reply.

189
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,840
So I ran back in again and I did the same thing.

190
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,600
He stayed right there, flipped it off, flipped it on, flipped it off, flipped it on, ran

191
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
back outside.

192
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,560
I know Bill Holliman thought I was a nut by that time.

193
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,520
So I get back out there and it flipped off and it did not come back on and it, but when

194
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,800
it did come on was about, it was about 30 seconds or so it had moved just a little bit

195
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,920
north, but it had moved further westward, like from that position to this position,

196
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,080
say from the, say from the three o'clock position where I was visualizing it, seeing it maybe

197
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,280
to the one 30 position, something like that.

198
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,240
And it came on and it just stayed right there.

199
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,520
Never heard anything.

200
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,680
Never saw any type of flame or anything like an afterburner or nothing.

201
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
It didn't move.

202
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,280
It just was right there and he goes, Hey man, he goes, he just said, I don't know.

203
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,480
And I said, what do you think it could be?

204
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,920
Oh, whatever, whatever.

205
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,240
And he walked back inside.

206
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,280
So the last time I went in there and flipped the lights at the thing, came back out and

207
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,200
then that would be the fourth time.

208
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,960
And it was out and I didn't see it again.

209
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,520
It was, when I came back out, it was gone or it was out.

210
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,240
So I, I just shook my head.

211
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
I just took it as well.

212
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,920
I guess they went that way, you know, maybe flying up toward or over toward Bellefouche,

213
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,080
which is about 30 miles away, north and west of our location.

214
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,120
More north of that's North Dakota, you know?

215
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,960
So I mean, we were in that proximity in that high Northwestern area there.

216
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,520
And so I just went back inside and I guess all this time from like quarter after nine

217
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,240
to about nine forties, when all this transpired, you know, maybe nine 35, it's hard to be exact,

218
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,800
but I try to be, and I went in and started playing some cards, watching TV or something

219
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,120
or he didn't want to do anything.

220
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,680
As I said, we literally didn't know each other and we didn't, we spoke very little.

221
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,040
And other than the fact that I knew, you know, the area in November, you know, that site

222
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,640
and all the missile sites where they were located, which are 10 of them, he was just

223
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,720
there to fill in.

224
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,840
So we watched TV until midnight and that signal comes on, it used to be looked like a radiological

225
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,280
signal used to come on at 12 o'clock when all the three stations that we have would

226
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,880
go off the air and then it would have that loud noise, you know, that signal.

227
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Static.

228
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
Yeah.

229
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
So that happened.

230
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,320
So he just turned the TV off.

231
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,080
Nation was a different place then believe me, was in a different place then.

232
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,440
And I guess it was about 12, 15 when as I was sitting down, I think I was looking at

233
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,560
a book or something, I hear the alert phone in the flight security controller's office

234
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,360
go off.

235
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,480
And that's the phone that's directly connected to the launch control people downstairs, two

236
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
officers downstairs.

237
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,680
And it sounds like, and it rings until you pick it up.

238
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,160
You got to snatch it off the wall and of course, Bill Holliman did that.

239
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,200
And I hear him saying, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir, sit for November five, which is

240
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,320
a two-pronged alarm.

241
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,760
It's an above ground and a below ground sensor that has been affected.

242
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,720
And as I said, the temperature was between nine and 13 degrees that night.

243
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
So it was cold.

244
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:47,440
So I had on my long johns, fatigue pants and shirt and my, I had on bunny boots because

245
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,760
I knew I was going to be doing some walking because you have to do a certain type of route

246
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:58,640
around the facility on foot inside and outside the fence line, which is a good walk.

247
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,840
And in snow, it gets kind of a little dicey because it just does.

248
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,680
But anyway, so we got all of our equipment.

249
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,680
We had our weapons.

250
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,880
We had our code tables.

251
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,920
We had our ditty bags, which is what you carry all your stuff in.

252
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,880
And the F-154 pickup truck was sitting directly outside our front door.

253
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,800
We keep it plugged in because it gets so cold there that it will freeze up the coolant in

254
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,640
your engine, or they also have a way of keeping the transmission warm with a plugin.

255
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,720
So unplug that.

256
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
We were set to go.

257
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,920
The vehicle's warming up and we got our safety briefing and everything that we needed and

258
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,080
off we went.

259
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:44,720
And I'd say that was probably right around 12, 20, 12, 25, and it was a 15 minute travel

260
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,960
time to November 5.

261
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,840
And strangely enough, that was the closest launch facility to our launch control facility

262
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
where we lived.

263
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,440
It was the closest one as the crow flies.

264
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,080
It was only maybe five and a half miles away, but the way that you had to get there made

265
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:10,040
it probably 10 miles or eight and a half, 10 miles somewhere in there.

266
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,800
So as we left, we go through the gate out to the end.

267
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,960
These are all clay roads.

268
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,720
You can go from one interstate on the other on the clay road and they're maintained by

269
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
the state.

270
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
They're very nice.

271
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,960
Got to the intersection, hung a left.

272
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
There's no traffic.

273
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,160
Believe me, there's no traffic.

274
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,320
And next intersection turned left and it's four and a half miles from that intersection

275
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,280
up to Highway 79, which runs down to Newell.

276
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,360
So you're going uphill as you go down in this little depression area, you're going uphill

277
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,920
toward the highway bed as they build them high as the snow and ice runs off of them.

278
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:52,040
And I just happened to look to about my four o'clock position straight that way where November

279
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
5 was located.

280
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:00,760
And when I did, I see this pulsation like an orange, yellow, and white type glow coming

281
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,720
off the ground from miles away should have never, never seen that before.

282
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,520
And I said, Hey, Michael, I said, check this out, man.

283
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,040
I said, you see that glow over there?

284
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,040
I said, look, look, I said, can you see that?

285
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,480
He didn't say anything yet.

286
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,000
And as we got up to highway 79 and we turned right, then we're on top of that plateau.

287
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,920
And now that four o'clock has become like a one 30 again.

288
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,840
And I said, look at that, man, I'm telling you, that's that object.

289
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,720
And why I said that, I don't know.

290
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,320
He just said, whatever, man.

291
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,480
And he said that to me a couple of times that night, whatever, man.

292
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:42,000
So as we've traversed down highway 79 toward Newell to a stop sign, there's one stop sign

293
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,120
and one stop light in Newell and the population then was 230 people in that town.

294
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,360
And it was on the entrance and the exit on highway 79.

295
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,240
Every time I entered Newell population was 230.

296
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,840
When I left, it was 230.

297
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,880
So now it's 600 and something as I was there in 21.

298
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,700
But as we went downhill, I lost sight of that pulsating glow.

299
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,800
We went down to the stop sign.

300
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,180
We took a right and the road goes out about a mile and a half and then a dog legs back

301
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,720
to the left.

302
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,960
And as we turn left on the, not a hard left, just a dog leg left, there sat this object

303
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,640
On top of November 5, that was about 10 feet in the air directly on top of that blast door.

304
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,000
That was the size of a Walmart building.

305
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,320
This thing was as big as this building you're in right here.

306
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,180
It was, it was huge and it was a sphere.

307
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,920
It had an energy source that, that moved around it.

308
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,600
Like, like you'd see pictures of the sun, how it's just like boiling.

309
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,180
I don't want to call it plasma, but I don't know what, what really to call it.

310
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,100
There were no tail sections, no, no, no portholes.

311
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,260
There were no thrusters.

312
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:01,420
There was no leading edges of any kind, no wings, tail, nothing that we would associate

313
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,740
anything in the air with.

314
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:08,180
It was a complete sphere, but on a magnitude that is just hard to even comprehend.

315
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,380
As you know, I'm always on the hunt for things that help me stay sharp, focused and full

316
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,680
of energy while I'm diving into life's mysteries and making this show happen.

317
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,160
And I've got to say, mud water has completely transformed my mornings.

318
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,040
Back in the day, I used to struggle with that post coffee crash and let's not even get into

319
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,100
the caffeine jitters.

320
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,880
Mud water gave me the smooth, steady energy I was missing.

321
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,620
It's packed with functional mushrooms like lion's mane, chaga and reishi, plus turmeric

322
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,440
and cacao all working together to keep me focused, calm and grounded.

323
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,500
Honestly, it's like coffee went on a yoga retreat and came back zen.

324
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,100
What I love most is that it's not just about replacing coffee.

325
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,920
It's a whole new ritual.

326
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,900
It's a simple, nourishing way to start the day.

327
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,860
And I actually look forward to it every morning.

328
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:03,360
Every ingredient is USDA certified organic, vegan, non-GMO and there's zero sugar.

329
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,580
It's energy that doesn't mess with your sleep or make you question your life choices at

330
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,580
3 a.m.

short for anything less than clean, delicious energy.

340
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:58,860
So we pulled up to this thing about 60 feet on the access road to the site itself.

341
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:04,140
Yeah, I think the fence was either 10 or 12 foot fence with big opening gates on it.

342
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,380
And we pulled up at a 45 degree angle right where the cattle crossing is located because

343
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,020
all these ranchers own this property and the property was leased from them to put these

344
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,220
missile sites on back in the day when they built them.

345
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,580
So the cattle can't come out into the main road.

346
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,700
It still happens, but it really decreases that from occurring.

347
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:29,500
So we pulled up right at that cattle gate and immediately upon doing so, immediately

348
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:36,980
upon doing so, it was as if a light came down that just about blew my eyeballs out of my

349
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,140
head.

350
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,980
You could literally almost see the veins behind your eyelids.

351
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:52,500
It was as if, I don't know what kind of energy that was, but whatever was released or put

352
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,180
down our way just completely almost disabled you just from the brightness.

353
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,140
It was like living in a welder's light for a few moments.

354
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:06,680
And then the atmosphere just vacated, couldn't breathe, literally could not get a breath

355
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
of air.

356
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,440
That was from my excitement.

357
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:16,080
I don't know if it's from adrenaline, I'm 23 years old, I was in excellent shape.

358
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,280
I could flat foot 25 miles in full combat dress and smoke a cigarette at the end of

359
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
it.

360
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
Didn't bother me a bit.

361
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,480
Literally I was in that kind of shape.

362
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,520
And I was just so taken.

363
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:34,440
Michael Johnson, I never remember him looking up at the thing, but for me, I was at a 45

364
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:41,160
degree angle and I'm looking directly out his window and part of the back window, this

365
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:48,680
is an F-154 pickup truck, a 1975 or 76, I can't remember which, but the square body

366
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:55,640
type pickup truck with western mirrors on the sides of them, two wheel drive vehicles.

367
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,240
And the only thing I knew to do was to ask for relief.

368
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,480
And where did that come from?

369
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,040
I have no idea where that thought or impulse came from.

370
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,560
You pray to God or Jesus or just relief generically?

371
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:16,520
I think he was in there and I just asked for relief from what I was experiencing to breathe

372
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,620
because I didn't think I was going to be able to take another breath of air.

373
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:25,480
And I grabbed my flashlight, which I've gotten ridiculed before.

374
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,920
It was an aluminum black 3D cell flashlight.

375
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,360
I think it was made in Japan, I'm not sure, but it was a great tool and they just started

376
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
making them.

377
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,960
Now Maglite didn't come out until 79, I had this in 77, it was given to me as a gift.

378
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:51,720
And I rolled the window down and I reached up with my right hand and I grabbed onto that

379
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,200
mirror, pulled myself up on that window seal because I was so afraid to step out of the

380
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,520
cab of that truck.

381
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,640
Now I'm fully armed, why would I be afraid?

382
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,240
I've never been afraid to do anything, especially in my duty.

383
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:14,000
I was so afraid of what I was experiencing, I didn't know how to deal with it.

384
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,960
I pulled myself up on the window seal of that truck out of that seat and I grabbed my flashlight

385
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,360
and I had a glove on my left hand and I had my flashlight in my right hand and I had my

386
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,840
hand on the blue bubble up on top of the glove and I just flashed that flashlight at this

387
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,040
thing like I did at the facility, I guess, I don't really know.

388
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:43,920
And as soon as I did, it felt like I got relief, it felt like there was relief.

389
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,440
And I just slid back down in the seat and as I slid back down in the seat, I noticed

390
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:56,360
dust particles and stuff and the way in which that cab was lit up that's hard to describe.

391
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,880
It seemed like everything was in slow motion.

392
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:06,480
Like the dust that was in that cab circulating from the vent work was like it was in slow

393
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
motion movement.

394
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,940
I was looking at it, it was like sparkles or something or like glitter.

395
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,880
It was like that.

396
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
And I thought, what's happening here?

397
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
What is this?

398
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,280
And I was trying to breathe, I was trying to talk to Michael, got no answer from him

399
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,840
as he was just stuck or glued to that steering wheel and he was just bathed in a blue white

400
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
light.

401
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:35,840
You know, the light intensity never honestly went away, it was just all-encompassing, it

402
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,840
was just all surrounding to a point where you're like trapped in light.

403
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,400
There's nowhere to go, I mean, there's nothing you can do about it, you just, I don't know,

404
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:57,760
I just felt like somebody had me right where they wanted me for some reason.

405
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,360
These thoughts and all this that I just described went by in just a couple of seconds, not minutes,

406
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,800
but just a couple of seconds.

407
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:12,920
All this just happened so fast, faster than what I've just told you and then this black

408
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:18,960
ball about six times the size of a beach ball looked like if it had vents or something

409
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:27,120
on it, not round vents, but these long, long like lines coming down the side of it, just

410
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:35,280
it didn't touch our truck, but it shot right down in front over the hood of this F-150.

411
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:42,400
And I don't even know what to say, but it was so fast and so whatever it was doing quick

412
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,120
that it just bounced around from every location on the truck, front, back, left, right, in

413
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,880
front and then it was just gone.

414
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,680
And I still don't know how much time has passed.

415
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:05,000
Then I became afraid and I made sure I rolled my window up.

416
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,160
I put my M16, when I slid back into the truck, I put my M16 between my legs and I was holding

417
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
onto the barrel.

418
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,440
I don't know where my flashlight went.

419
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,720
I just knew to secure my weapon between my legs and I held onto the barrel and this permeating

420
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,800
smell, I have no idea where it came from because as I said, my window was up and I know his

421
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,440
window was up, so it had to come through the ventilation duct work, I guess.

422
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,480
But it permeated the vehicle like, I mean, stench smell, bad ammonia, like you want to

423
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,800
roll the windows down, you want to step outside and get some fresh air.

424
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,120
Some of the cleanest air on the planet runs through South Dakota year round, but this

425
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:54,040
was like standing in a, I don't know, in a bottom of a boat or something, you know, where

426
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,440
they catch shrimp, I guess, and dump them there, but put them there.

427
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,800
I shouldn't even say that, but anyway, it was overwhelming.

428
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:12,040
When I smell that, I just got a real strange feeling from within, like something when you're

429
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:17,360
afraid or when you're scared or something because I knew that wasn't normal and I know

430
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,400
I'd never smelled that before, I only associated it with what I smelled in the past trying

431
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:29,760
to make maybe a visualization in my mind what it could be.

432
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:37,360
The light never stopped, the pressure did, we could breathe again or I could breathe

433
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
again.

434
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:45,400
Michael Johnson, he never said anything from the time we rolled up to that site, anything.

435
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,800
The last thing he said to me was on the top of Highway 79 when whatever, man, as it was

436
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,800
glowing over in the far distance that I saw this pulsation off the ground or what I took

437
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,760
ass off the ground from where we were from driving there.

438
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:13,160
And so when that happened, I felt as if I was becoming sleepy or tunnel visioned or

439
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
something.

440
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,680
I kept shaking my head as I relive it.

441
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:22,640
As we're sitting here right now, I kept trying to, I felt as if I was going to go out.

442
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:29,960
So I was trying to hold my breath and squeeze, like pilots do that and G-suits to keep the

443
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,480
blood in their head, but I felt as if I was going to pass out.

444
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,880
And I started getting this tunnel vision effect in a way where I couldn't see and it was just

445
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,640
getting smaller and smaller and it was black on the exterior of that visual that I was

446
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,240
looking out the front window.

447
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,240
All these thoughts are running around in your brain and this is all taking place and just

448
00:30:52,840 --> 00:31:00,320
a couple of minutes, not 10 minutes, not even five minutes from what I understand.

449
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,400
And as I'm blacking out, I know I feel something on my right side.

450
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:12,200
And I turn my head and I see these four, I'm going to call them beings.

451
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,700
And they are not walking as you and I walk.

452
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,360
They are just gliding across the ground.

453
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,640
Maybe I don't know how high off the ground.

454
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,640
I couldn't really see that, but they have these little uniforms on.

455
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,120
And the one on the far right, he had some type of a small one in his waist belt.

456
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:37,680
I've got a drawing of it that had a yellow tip on it, some type of a yellow tip.

457
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,980
And it really got my attention.

458
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:47,520
And I was, and I just couldn't believe what I was seeing, but the one behind those three,

459
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,920
the front three were the same size, exactly the same size, looked exactly the same.

460
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,720
But the one behind them was a chest and a head taller than the little guys.

461
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,360
And he had this thing on his chest right here that pulsated the same color as what was on

462
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
that little one.

463
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:15,360
And when I saw him, then I was afraid, then I felt fear, maybe just visualized fear.

464
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,360
I don't know.

465
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,720
I didn't do anything to me that caused fear other than where I was and what I had just

466
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,420
gone through.

467
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,840
And then I went black.

468
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,400
I just went, that's the last thing that I saw in my mind.

469
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:37,100
And just a second went by and literally I came, when I came to, my weapon was between

470
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,160
my legs and I'm still holding on to it.

471
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,660
And I just looked straight up like that and right out the windshield of that 150 in his

472
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,700
total blackness.

473
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,180
And I thought, where, where'd all the light go?

474
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,660
Where's no, literally, I don't even know where it was.

475
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,560
We were, I said, Michael, Michael, where are we?

476
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
What happened?

477
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
Where's November five?

478
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,300
Cause this, this lit up, it has lights on it.

479
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,540
You know, they're like, like pole lights and has those types of lights on it at night.

480
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,040
This is a standalone facility.

481
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:13,760
So even if external powers cut, this thing takes over and has a generator run itself,

482
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,980
right?

483
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,080
No answer from Michael.

484
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,840
And I kept yelling at him, Michael, Michael, what's going on with you, man?

485
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,680
And I pushed him in his shoulder really hard.

486
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,440
I even, I put my finger in his ear after a couple of minutes, I shoved him, shoved him,

487
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,660
checked his pulse.

488
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,660
He was breathing.

489
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,340
I couldn't get anything out of him.

490
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,760
He was as if he was in some type of a state that I didn't even really know to have the

491
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,720
words for, as if he was, his eyes were open and he was breathing and his heart was pumping,

492
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,760
but he was just stuck on that steering wheel.

493
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,080
And I, I, I tried, I don't know how many times to get him to say something.

494
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,700
I said, snap out of it, man.

495
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,700
What's going on?

496
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,700
What's wrong?

497
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,680
I got frustrated with that.

498
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,560
And I just popped the door open, little lever on the side, I popped the door open and I

499
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,920
stepped out trying to get in my mind where November five go.

500
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Cause that's where we were.

501
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,160
And this was a, this was a, a very serious alarm.

502
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:19,600
So that, that reason had to be found out why that thing alarmed where, how it did in that,

503
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,640
in that alarm configuration.

504
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,880
And when I stepped down, I stepped in mud with those bunny boots on and I went, what

505
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,640
the hell?

506
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,880
How is this?

507
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,520
And then to my right, where your chair is located, maybe a foot further, there was a

508
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,920
wall there at about a 45 degree angle and it was white and it went up about, I don't

509
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:45,420
know, as far as I could see like 50 feet, but my eyes got more accustomed to the darkness.

510
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:52,080
And then when I looked in both directions, not knowing exactly where I was on the compass,

511
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,800
it was as far as I could see that direction, as far as I could see that direction and up

512
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,200
about 50 feet.

513
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:04,560
When I become acclimated to the, to the darkness, had no idea where this was.

514
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,800
I said, Michael, come on, man, you got to wake up, dude, we're, you know, we're in

515
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
bad way here.

516
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,800
We got to find out what the, what the hell's going on here, you know, nothing, nothing.

517
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,200
I even tried pulling his hand off that steering wheel and he was just, he was just, I don't

518
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,560
know how a person can stay that tense and for so long that they don't cramp up.

519
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,720
I would cramp up doing that, but he did.

520
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:40,600
The next thing that I knew was I hear WSC to November one, that's us WSC November one,

521
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,840
what's your location?

522
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,400
And I just, I said, are you going to get that thinking that would snap him out of that here

523
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,980
in that radio signal, a radio call for us, he didn't answer.

524
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:59,540
And I picked it up and I said, senior Airman Woods WSC, I said, I don't know where we are.

525
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:04,380
And he goes, do you need medical help or do you need assistance?

526
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,700
And I said, I don't know, sir.

527
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,060
I said, I'm fine, but my partner won't respond to me.

528
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,940
I said, he's awake, breathing and well, but he won't let go of the steering wheel and

529
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,420
he's just sitting in a driver's seat just like he is stuck.

530
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,500
He's just like in the frozen catatonic state.

531
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,260
That's the word that I had never heard when it was told to me catatonic state.

532
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,260
And that's correct.

533
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,760
He was.

534
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:32,180
So when I, when I finally got out of the vehicle again and walked and looked and I'm talking

535
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:42,300
where did all this mud come from with this temperature, because everything else is frozen.

536
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:49,660
As I said, that wall was at about 50 feet high and at this strange angle, like 45 degrees.

537
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,180
Well, it was the backside of the New Lake reservoir dam.

538
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:00,900
And that is about on the map, about eight miles, eight and a half miles away from November

539
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,900
5.

540
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:07,740
Now we only had two wheel drive vehicles and where we were positioned behind that dam was

541
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:15,380
in the very center of that dam wall at the, at really at the most center point.

542
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:20,340
And at the far end was the slew gate where they control the water flow and allow it to

543
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,340
go out.

544
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,420
If it gets, if the reservoir gets too full and in front of us was the rest of the dam

545
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:36,420
and it, that road ran north and south wing security control told me to maintain one minute

546
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,420
security checks.

547
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,700
So they were trying to triangulate our location.

548
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,420
Now I had never done that in tech school, but I'd heard of it.

549
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,120
I may have read something about it, but I'd never done it or been part of that, that training.

550
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,160
So I didn't know how it was done.

551
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,060
So I did what they ask and I probably made, it probably made, I don't know, I probably

552
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,980
made 20, 25 checks before they got to us.

553
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:06,340
And as I was doing that, I noticed it was getting light to the east and that was the

554
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,700
sun coming up.

555
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:13,540
And then it dawned on me, well, man, we got this alarm last night at 1215.

556
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,700
And I looked at my watch and it was after 6 AM.

557
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:22,460
So we have all that missing time and I can't explain any of it because for me, it was just

558
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,200
what I saw, what we experienced, what I smelled lights out.

559
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:34,900
Next thing I know, we're sitting behind the new Lake reservoir dam miles away, miles away.

560
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:40,500
Sergeant Garza, there were three alert teams looking for us.

561
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,780
So that's six security policemen from three different sites, whether they use the primary

562
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,780
or the backup alert teams, I'm not really sure.

563
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:54,660
And in 2021 discovered that not only did they, were they searching for us, but wing security

564
00:38:54,660 --> 00:39:02,720
control or the base control or whoever they were asked for federal or state assistance.

565
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,840
So they sent out two deputy officers from Sturgis and one state trooper, that area was

566
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,280
his area.

567
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:17,160
And I've got a guy named Steve that's working on, as he is a state trooper today, who that

568
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,040
deputy or who that state trooper was, it was on duty at that time.

569
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,080
And two of the three are passed, but one last name Kellogg is still alive.

570
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,160
And I'm trying to make contact with him.

571
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,960
Did Michael Johnson ever make it out of his catatonic state?

572
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
Your partner?

573
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,280
No, not while we were there.

574
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,860
When Sergeant Garza pulled up, he pulled up within say 60 feet, I guess he didn't want

575
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:46,200
to get in, get into the, to the snow area that we were in.

576
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,500
He pulled up and I walked around the back of the truck, walked out toward him.

577
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,040
And I said, I said, Hey, Sergeant Garza, how's it going?

578
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,040
I said, what's going on?

579
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,100
He said, Mario, I can't talk to you about this.

580
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,780
He said, I'm just here to escort you back to November control.

581
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,980
And I said, okay, but I need help with Michael Johnson.

582
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,300
And he looked at me kind of strange.

583
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,300
He said, what do you mean?

584
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,340
I said, I can't get him off the steering wheel and he won't talk.

585
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,340
He won't say anything.

586
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,060
Well, you know, I've never dealt with anything like that.

587
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:17,940
Or anybody else has that I know over somebody's, you know, locked up frozen in some type of

588
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:24,780
state of our catatonic state, hanging on to something, you know, usually you can, you

589
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,540
know, I literally couldn't believe how hard it was to get that man's hands off that steering

590
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,540
wheel.

591
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,220
I really, I couldn't believe it.

592
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,020
So we unbelted him and did that.

593
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,740
We slid him across the driver's seat and into the passenger side, belted him back in.

594
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:41,500
He just sat there with his hands down, looking forward and I kept talking to him thinking

595
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:46,220
at some point he would just feel fall free, you know, or whatever he was experiencing.

596
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:51,540
But again, this was a two wheel drive vehicle and walking around that vehicle, as I just

597
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:57,380
described on the left side or driver's side of that vehicle, about four and a half foot

598
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,260
away from that door was a big drop off.

599
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,260
It's there today.

600
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:06,820
And that is the, the holding pond for anything that comes out of that dam.

601
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,260
And it's pretty dead gum deep.

602
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:15,780
So had we gone in there, driven in there, I'm just, this is a what if now, had we driven

603
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,060
in there, that road's only five feet wide, there's no way that this two wheel drive F

604
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,340
150 forward would road tires on it.

605
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,900
Not even any big mud tires or anything, they didn't even have those back then, would be

606
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,700
able to turn around.

607
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,260
We were just in the only position we could be in to drive out of that dead gum place

608
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:39,740
and I drove out of it and I never went over any tracks and it hadn't snowed anymore or

609
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,160
anything had, nothing had changed since, since we were there.

610
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,140
When I left out of there, it was the only set of tracks coming out of where we were.

611
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,580
One set of tracks, but had he opened that door and stepped out of that vehicle or I

612
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,300
had, you'd have gone right down with now, you know, wouldn't have probably just slid

613
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,140
down in mud, but it was down pretty deep and that it was just amazing to me how we were

614
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,760
in the right position to exit there.

615
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:11,580
That's important to me, uh, trying to explain it to myself, how, how this took place.

616
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:17,700
So follow them back to the launch control facility to November one.

617
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:23,460
They escorted us all the way there and then, uh, two of the three teams dropped off and

618
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:28,500
I guess Garza or one of the teams remained, I guess they had to have, when we were going

619
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,660
to be removed from the site and taken back to the main base of Ellsworth, which is about

620
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,660
55 miles away.

621
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,180
And I didn't know that at the time they had to have our replacements immediately there

622
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,940
that you can't be understaffed on any kind of launch control facility.

623
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,260
It has to be fully staffed at all times.

624
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:52,700
So when we pulled up at the site, my flight chief was there, Master Sergeant Hawkins or

625
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:58,660
Master Sergeant Joel Gray, Assistant Flight Chief was Tech Sergeant Hawkins, the, um,

626
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,020
facility manager.

627
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,020
He was a tech sergeant.

628
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,020
Yeah.

629
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,940
The two officers that were on duty, they were off duty now and they were above ground.

630
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,940
They had been relieved.

631
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:14,980
Their replacements were underground, uh, Bill Holliman, the site cook, uh, and of course

632
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:22,020
you had, um, one of the, the one, uh, security response team that remained him and his partner.

633
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,900
So they took me in the day room and I told them when they came out to meet us, the gate

634
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,900
slides open.

635
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:33,260
I pulled in right in front of the flight security controller's office and they just descended

636
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,260
upon the vehicle.

637
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,940
Well, we got our, got our bags out and all that stuff and they went to the passenger

638
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,140
side and I said, I don't know what's wrong with Michael.

639
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,540
I said, I can't get him to speak.

640
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,300
And I said, we had a heck of a time getting them off the steering wheel.

641
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,020
Nobody said anything at that point.

642
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,020
They took him, put him, uh, put his arms over their shoulders and they took him to the back

643
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,020
room.

644
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:56,700
I think in the, in the, uh, facility manager's quarters, I don't know what they did, but

645
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,020
that's where they took him.

646
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:03,100
They took me into the day room where I walked into the day room and mind you, I'd been up

647
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:08,320
the entire day before five o'clock in the morning till we had guard mount traveled,

648
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:15,000
you know, to get out there then stayed up all day, went all night long until this happened.

649
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,920
And uh, so now it's probably somewhere around, um, I'm going to say seven 15, seven 30 in

650
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,720
the morning, uh, and we had just departed new Lake reservoir dam and I'd never been

651
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,720
there before.

652
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,400
I never, I never knew that place was even there and it's a little north of November

653
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,840
control and it's sitting back off the road about four and a half miles.

654
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,640
So it sits way back up on the prairie and I honestly had never been there before nor

655
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,920
knew about it.

656
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,880
And uh, so they started banging me with questions and what did you see?

657
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,360
What did you do?

658
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,240
You know, how did you do this?

659
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,520
Uh, you communicated this, you didn't report this, you know, what was wrong with the site?

660
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,640
Just all these things were coming at me and I was answering every single one of them.

661
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,200
And they believe me, there was a bunch of questions.

662
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:12,680
You just don't go missing on a, on a, on a nuclear missile site for, for five hours

663
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,560
and not answer questions.

664
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,560
It's a big deal.

665
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,840
Did you get the sense when they were asking you questions that they had seen things like

666
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,400
this before or like it was this completely novel thing where it's like, what the hell

667
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
happened here?

668
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,400
We have no idea.

669
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,440
Like we have no idea how to even, we have no pattern recognition for this.

670
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,680
Well, there were rumors years before I got there that something happened down toward

671
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:42,200
the Badlands in the 66th area and where two security policemen were found, uh, out of

672
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,200
their vehicle.

673
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,320
The vehicle was, you know, some distance away from them.

674
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,560
Their weapons were distance from them and an opener prairie and they, one was found

675
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,560
completely with no clothes on.

676
00:45:53,560 --> 00:46:00,300
The other was just about like 90% unclothed and I don't know what happened to that.

677
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,020
But there, there were always talks and rumors about things in the air or things on the

678
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:10,860
back of the runway at Ellsworth, you know, B-52s uploaded bombers that are ready to go

679
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,220
uploaded on the alert pad.

680
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,100
And uh, what did they use?

681
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:21,380
F-86s at one point or a couple of times to chase these objects away.

682
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,760
And I think there's several reports of that.

683
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,780
One of the guys that I know, uh, who's an S-16 pilot, uh, Chris Lato, we were talking

684
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:36,100
about, we were talking about that one time, uh, but anyway, they questioned me up one

685
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,740
side and down the other.

686
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:44,140
And uh, I, I, I remember telling, uh, Master Sergeant Gray, I said, I can draw some things

687
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,140
if you'd like me to.

688
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:51,020
And um, that the question never really got, I don't know if it didn't get to him or answer

689
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:56,500
to or what happened, but, uh, he just, they just kept asking questions and I, and I got

690
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,700
to the point where it was just, everything was just at one time coming from every space

691
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,940
in my mind, questions about the whole deal.

692
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:09,260
And I said, Hey, I said, I got to go to the restroom just to get away from it for 10 seconds.

693
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:14,220
I just wanted a little bit of peace just for a few seconds of trying to cope with what

694
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:22,820
I had just seen, lived through and experienced as this is nothing I ever had before.

695
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:27,020
And I went to the restroom and I opened up the stall door, which is still there today.

696
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:34,660
I went right back to it in 21 and I just went and sat on the toilet and closed the door.

697
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:39,420
And you know, it was a regular stall door, doors about that high up off the floor, blue.

698
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,980
And these, these facilities were extremely nice.

699
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:47,260
I mean, you could, they were, they were not, uh, they were very well maintained and extremely

700
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,460
nice.

701
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:53,180
And I was just sitting there on that toilet thinking about what I had seen and, and what

702
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,340
had transpired.

703
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,340
You know, the thought hit me.

704
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,220
I didn't even strike the site and that's the procedure that you do when you arrive at the

705
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:06,020
facility that you, that's required for you have these steps that you have to follow to

706
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:13,140
eliminate whatever threat there is there, but to assess the entire situation and report

707
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,460
that back.

708
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,020
We never reported anything back like that, you know, and we didn't, I don't even think

709
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:22,660
we used the radio from moments of arrival and I really don't.

710
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:25,740
I can't remember if we did.

711
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:32,140
And all of a sudden, Jesse, I get this ringing in my ears that was as if somebody struck

712
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,260
a Liberty bell right next to my head.

713
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:38,500
I mean, really I have to emphasize that cause it was like, it got my attention.

714
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:44,060
I don't know if I reached up and put my hands on my ears or what, but when it happened,

715
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:49,500
lime green to me, like pea green.

716
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:55,580
And I didn't, uh, it was as if my vision was changing or some part of my visual acuity

717
00:48:55,580 --> 00:49:01,180
was changing and I closed my eyes.

718
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,900
And when I did, I had this feeling.

719
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,020
I was leaving my body literally.

720
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,620
I was, you know, I thought I was dying.

721
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:14,780
I said, I guess this is, this, this is how you die.

722
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:18,940
And every time I closed my eyes, I felt as if I went without going anywhere.

723
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:26,940
I felt as if I kept going lower within myself and I knew there was a clear channel to exit

724
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,540
me through my feet.

725
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,860
I knew there was, it was a map.

726
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:36,900
There was something there that I could leave if I so chose to do so.

727
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,540
And it scared me to death.

728
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,780
It's literally scared me to death, man.

729
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:47,780
And when I opened my eyes at last time, I saw four fuzzy feet walking by pause, walking

730
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:52,580
by the bottom of that door with a set of Cochran military boots behind him.

731
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,700
That was a dog handler and his drug dog.

732
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,220
So you know, they had gotten one that they had gotten them to come out 55 miles out from

733
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:04,300
base to go through all of our stuff, make sure there's no drugs involved.

734
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,940
And I said, man, I said, I'm glad to, I'm glad to see you because he didn't know what

735
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:08,980
I just experienced.

736
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,740
And I said, my Diddy bag is out there in a day room.

737
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,900
He says, that's all right, Mario.

738
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,580
We already have it.

739
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,620
I don't know who he was, but he knew my name.

740
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,860
I don't know if he had just been told my name or what, you know, I played a lot of

741
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,980
tennis back then and he may have been somebody I played with.

742
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:27,900
But, uh, I said, I'll be out in just a minute, man.

743
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,180
He goes, yeah, no worries, man.

744
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:29,980
He says, you're all good.

745
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,140
Just come and check on you.

746
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:31,740
That's what he said.

747
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,940
Just came in to check on you.

748
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:33,860
And I said, thank you.

749
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,460
So they, they left her.

750
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,020
We're leaving.

751
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:40,580
And I opened up the stall door and I just went to the sink and mind you, I still have

752
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:46,620
on my long johns and my fatigue pants and shirt and, you know, same clothes.

753
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,820
I was in about 30 hours now.

754
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,940
And I just turned that faucet on as ice cold water.

755
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,940
And I just literally just drowned in myself with water.

756
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:59,580
I was just soaking wet because a master Sergeant Gray said something to me as I came out

757
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,420
there and he said, what'd you do?

758
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,260
Climb in the sink or something like that.

759
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,060
And I, and I did, I don't even know if I answered.

760
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,340
I just said, yes, sir.

761
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:13,620
Um, so I, I think I had a towel in my hand and he said, well, he goes, get your stuff.

762
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,860
He goes, we have to go, we have to go back to the SATA building.

763
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,860
That was our main operations building on Ellsworth.

764
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,820
And I said, yes, sir.

765
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,380
So I grabbed my stuff and immediately I said, well, what about Michael Johnson?

766
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,540
He said, don't worry about him.

767
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,820
He'll be going with Sergeant Hawkins.

768
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,580
I said, okay.

769
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,020
And I really wanted to talk to him, but immediately upon arrival at

770
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,060
that site, we were separated right then and there.

771
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,940
And I don't know what good it would have done because he wasn't coherent

772
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,940
or wasn't answering or anything anyway.

773
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,100
He hadn't said a word.

774
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,100
Nothing, not one word that I knew of, not one word.

775
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,300
He hadn't said anything to me or to anybody else that was there.

776
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,900
And I don't know how they transported him, you know, other than him telling

777
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:53,620
me that Master Sergeant or Tech Sergeant Hawkins was going to take him to the base.

778
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:53,900
Right.

779
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:01,940
So I got my diddy bag and loaded up and, uh, got my weapon, everything.

780
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,020
Off.

781
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,100
We went to Ellsworth and it was about an hour, 10 minute ride back to Ellsworth.

782
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:11,420
We went in through the back gate at box elder and went straight to the

783
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:17,340
SATAP building and he escorted me the entire way armory turned in, turned

784
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,700
in my weapon, all that stuff.

785
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:28,340
And, um, which was normal procedure, you know, um, went to Ralph East

786
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,020
breaker's office under escort.

787
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:34,900
And of course, when you are called in like that, you do a formal report in

788
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,300
where you literally bang on, knock on the door frame or whatever, even if the

789
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:42,220
door's open, you knock on the door frame and then your commander, whomever

790
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:45,180
tell you can enter the room, you enter the room, go directly to his desk.

791
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:49,500
You know, he was together at attention, you know, report in, you know, senior

792
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,820
man was reporting as ordered, sir, you know, and, uh, he told me at ease, but

793
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,140
he didn't tell me I could sit down.

794
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:57,900
I never forget that.

795
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:01,540
I just thought it was strange, you know, and I, and he had to

796
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,540
know how long I'd been up.

797
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,940
I mean, I was, I was weakened.

798
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:10,180
If I may say, I just felt really weakened in a different state, not

799
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:14,300
knowing what I experienced, I was still wet from an hour and 15 minutes ago

800
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:20,860
from the sink, you know, so it was really strange and, uh, he asked me

801
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:25,980
some questions and he said, uh, I remember him saying, sounds as if

802
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,940
you've had an interesting evening or night or something like that.

803
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,780
And I said, yes, sir.

804
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,180
And I looked to my left and there's, there's a total of five people in that room.

805
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:39,380
There's the deputy base commander who I don't remember his name, but next to him

806
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:44,900
was a man in a gray tweed, uh, suit with a hat and the hat was under his arm.

807
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:55,620
Then there was a captain, uh, Jack Reed, OSI next to him was this new OSI guy

808
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,900
named Rick Doty.

809
00:53:59,100 --> 00:53:59,740
Interesting.

810
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,180
Yeah.

811
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:04,980
So, and do you have any speculation as to who the guy in the gray tweed suit was?

812
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,220
I was never introduced to him nor told his name.

813
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:13,220
And I only found out, uh, Jack Reed was a captain in OSI.

814
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,140
He was the lead OSI officer on Ellsworth at that time.

815
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:24,060
And, uh, through an email that Rick Doty sent me after about five years of

816
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:29,620
trying to, trying to get him to answer my emails or talk to me, because the first

817
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,340
time I saw him was on ancient aliens.

818
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,340
And I said, I know that guy.

819
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,380
He was at my debrief.

820
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,020
I was a counterintelligence officer for the air force office, special investigation.

821
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:42,060
I was personally fascinated by the fact that Richard Doty had been involved in

822
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,900
the aftermath of Mario's case.

823
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:48,460
I knew about Doty because of a great book called project beta by Greg Bishop.

824
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,860
Doty was an air force counterintelligence agent, basically tasked with performing

825
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:58,140
a psychological operation on an innocent researcher named Paul Benowitz, who had

826
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,020
seen an exotic craft at Kirtland air force base.

827
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,820
Doty convinced Benowitz that he was in touch with aliens, even receiving

828
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,220
signals on his computer.

829
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,860
This eventually drove Benowitz into psychiatric hospitalization.

830
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:14,660
So the fact that Doty was part of Mario's debrief is fascinating, seems very

831
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:17,820
important and requires follow-up by some brave souls.

832
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,780
And up to that point, I had nobody.

833
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:20,220
Yeah.

834
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,300
I had had nobody that could say, yeah, they were there or whatever, you know,

835
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:28,540
what have you, I tried running down my old flight chief and assistant flight chief,

836
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,380
but with no success or anybody else.

837
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,100
And especially Michael Johnson.

838
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,180
Some money has been spent trying to locate Michael Johnson.

839
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,460
We looked in hospitals.

840
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,260
We've looked in can't find him anywhere.

841
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:38,940
No, sir.

842
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:43,940
And I reported that the arrow in March of a 23, I think when I spoke with them.

843
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,740
Did they ever follow up at all?

844
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:46,620
I don't know.

845
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,860
They never got back with me.

846
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,300
Four hours and 19 minutes.

847
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,060
I spoke with them.

848
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:51,860
That's crazy.

849
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:52,100
Yeah.

850
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,860
And they set up to get a copy of everything which had been, you know, talked about.

851
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,340
They say they don't record it.

852
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:02,660
How do you, how do you, how do you send somebody a copy without recording something?

853
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,060
Come on.

854
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:03,940
That's ridiculous.

855
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,020
Can you write that fast?

856
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:09,220
No, but I mean, it's also like, and there's not, there's more than one person

857
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,140
sitting there also.

858
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,300
Oh my God.

859
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:15,260
But I mean, you're the government agency tasked for investigating UFOs and you

860
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,820
don't record your conversation.

861
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,180
It's absolutely absurd.

862
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:18,380
Yeah.

863
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,980
And then two weeks later is when Kirkpatrick went on and said there was no substantial

864
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,500
evidence.

865
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,540
Uh, can you contact Michael Johnson's family?

866
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,180
I don't have any way.

867
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,900
I don't have any, any numbers or anything.

868
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,540
He said he was from Chicago, Illinois.

869
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,900
Believe me, every resource, including other law enforcement officers that I know

870
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,060
today's technology have not located him yet.

871
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:38,940
Neither has arrow.

872
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,300
So what, what was your interaction with Doty?

873
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:42,300
Nothing.

874
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,140
Not one that we'd ever spoke or anything like that.

875
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,700
He was directly reporting to, uh, Captain Jack Reed next to him.

876
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:49,980
Okay.

877
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,340
So that's fascinating, right?

878
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:55,060
That this guy who's clearly this disinfo agent, you know, at least in the

879
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:00,100
context of Benowitz is showing up seven years earlier, eight years earlier in

880
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:04,580
your case, and you don't know why he's brand new then.

881
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:12,700
So as a person that's very high in this whole thing said, those were the days

882
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:20,820
that when he was probably honestly not, uh, changed in any way, perhaps.

883
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,900
I just want to say that the right way.

884
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:28,140
Cause we w you know, we, uh, I email him once in a while, um, and he'll answer me

885
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,660
back, whereas it took me about five years to get him to even do that.

886
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:35,540
And then we got to be on a, a cast together.

887
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,540
So real quick, just context, he now has come out saying he's reformed and he

888
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:44,180
apologizes for, you know, his malpractice in the past.

889
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,700
Uh, a lot of people are suspicious of that reform.

890
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,460
It does feel a little bit.

891
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,260
Sometimes to me, like he's flooding the zone with this info.

892
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:56,660
Like he'll talk about, you know, six alien races and it just seems extremely

893
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:00,180
speculative and not based on any sort of evidence, very weird.

894
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,940
Yeah, it's, it's, uh, it's more than I know how to swallow.

895
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:09,540
I only know that, uh, what I witnessed is my incident and, uh, anybody that I

896
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:13,620
could get that's, you know, that was there has some idea of it or that I knew.

897
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,460
I've done everything that I can to try and locate them.

898
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:20,780
And he is the only person so far that I have found alive.

899
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:24,300
And mind you, I'm 69 and I think he's older than I am.

900
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:29,460
I think, I think that's what he told me that he was in his 70s and I have no idea.

901
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:33,940
I mean, when I saw that thing the other day about him saying he was, it was from

902
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:39,060
78 to 88 when he was an OSI really, really bothered me.

903
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:41,300
And that was just last week that I saw that.

904
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:45,420
And, uh, I'll try to find the program again and I'll send you something about it.

905
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:49,660
Did you have any biological after-effects after you had this experience?

906
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:56,580
Well, I, uh, I, if you want me to, I'll, I'll explain that because I get sent over

907
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:02,620
to the, uh, flight surgeon's office after this entire debriefing takes place and

908
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:07,140
questions and like you wouldn't believe, uh, from my commander.

909
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:12,740
And I just relayed everything that I just told you with the exception of what I

910
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:18,020
saw or what I thought I saw at the side window of my vehicle.

911
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:25,780
Had I said that I saw these beings, they would have immediately removed me from

912
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,900
the PRP personal reliability program.

913
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:28,900
I'd have lost my clearance.

914
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,980
I'd have lost my job.

915
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,020
I'd have never been in the missile field again.

916
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:38,340
And I was a newlywed at the time and I needed a job and I loved what I was doing.

917
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:41,780
I just had no, no idea that something like this could even happen.

918
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,220
So did you lie about what happened to you?

919
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,260
No, I did not lie.

920
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,780
I just simply did not tell them what I saw out that side window.

921
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:53,740
I told them everything else, the size of the craft, you know, and, and how

922
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:59,180
we came upon it and flipping the facility lights at it and every, I told

923
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:04,260
them the entire story up to the point where what was out that window, I

924
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:08,460
never said a word about, so I had to write that in the report also, but that

925
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:14,660
was after about an hour and a half, almost two hours of this, uh, debriefing

926
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,860
in the commander's office.

927
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,020
And once that was done, he said, well, we're going to have the flight

928
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,180
surgeon take a look at you.

929
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,060
I said, yes, sir.

930
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:21,580
Okay.

931
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:26,380
So, uh, they loaded me up in his staff car and took me over to medical.

932
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,580
And I'd never been in a flight surgeon's office before.

933
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,780
Thinking, oh boy, well, you know, what's, what's this going to be?

934
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,660
And I'm still wet.

935
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:36,860
Like I said, I'm still damp from the water, the basin bath, I call it.

936
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:45,780
And, uh, I stripped down to my underwear and my, and my, and a T-shirt or something.

937
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,860
And there was a nurse in the room and there were two flight surgeons.

938
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:49,700
And that was the time.

939
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:54,820
And when they had these, uh, these gray, like separating walls that were about

940
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:57,740
five or six feet high with this little waving glass at the top of it.

941
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:01,380
So if you walked in another room over there, you could see heads, but you

942
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,660
couldn't see what was going on.

943
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,660
That used to be like a big, like a room divider or something.

944
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,660
And that was important because the guys from OSI, they were on the other side

945
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,620
of that, of that wall, of that, that panel.

946
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,260
And I knew they were there.

947
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:22,940
Uh, and as the doctors, you know, started, you know, asking me questions, uh,

948
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:28,820
it was one tall and one short, uh, they tested my ears, eyes, nose, throat,

949
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:33,620
looked at my joints, my hands, my fingers, you know, just literally everywhere.

950
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,980
And, uh, then they'd like walk over a few feet away and they'd talk a little

951
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,580
bit and I couldn't quite hear what they were saying.

952
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:42,500
And the nurse was just over to my right.

953
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:50,340
And, uh, came back and the one of them grabbed a, you know, a latex glove

954
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,540
and he puts it on his hand.

955
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:55,300
And I just thought there's a nurse in here and then he snapped that thing.

956
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,660
You know, I just thought, oh, you know, really I did.

957
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,140
I thought, oh man, you know, we're looking forward to this.

958
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,260
And, uh, he goes, uh, everyone woods.

959
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,100
You mind if I take a look at your gums?

960
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,140
And, uh, that was the, that was farthest from my mind of

961
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,540
anything in that room that day.

962
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,260
And I said, excuse me.

963
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:17,180
He goes, yeah, I need to, I need to look at your gums, your teeth.

964
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,540
I, I, that was better than the alternative.

965
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:21,260
I said, sure.

966
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:21,940
Okay.

967
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:27,220
So, uh, I just sat right there and he just opened my mouth and he just took

968
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,100
his, his index finger and his thumb.

969
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:34,340
And he just went all the way around by gums and my teeth squeezing tops and

970
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,780
bottoms that I mean, really took his time and spent time up here in the front

971
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:42,300
under my tongue, just pressing down like on the bottom, like the floor of

972
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,580
your jawbone or something.

973
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:48,980
And, uh, took him a couple of minutes and believe me, if somebody puts their

974
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,980
fingers in your mouth for a couple of minutes, it's strange feeling.

975
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:56,620
You know, it's not something that you want to repeat or have repeated.

976
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:57,660
Why do you think you checked that?

977
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:58,620
I have no idea.

978
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,140
I have honestly no idea.

979
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,340
And when he stopped, he popped the glove off.

980
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:05,340
He says, um, you know, you have a couple of burns on your body, right?

981
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:06,900
And I said, excuse me.

982
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:11,220
He goes, yeah, above your right eye and on the back of your right hand.

983
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,140
Well, I didn't have a glove on this hand.

984
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:17,980
And then my beret came down like this, you know, as my beret was on my head

985
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,660
and it burned me right above my eyebrow, right there.

986
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:23,620
Now I did have those air force glasses on.

987
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:27,900
So now I think that's why it had a strange curve in it in that, in that

988
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,060
little sunburn, but he says, we need to take a skin sample.

989
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,420
And I said, Oh, okay.

990
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:41,060
And they pulled out the nurse had this little tray, uh, with two types

991
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:45,980
of, uh, our two little, uh, stainless cylinders on it with cork tops on it.

992
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:52,140
And I guess the tool was inside the little cylinder thing.

993
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:53,660
He popped that off.

994
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,860
He went up here and he just clipped a piece of skin off there.

995
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:58,380
And he took the whole tool and he stuck it right down in there and put

996
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:59,700
a cork on it, laid it on that tray.

997
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:03,260
I felt it, you know, didn't feel like much, just a little clip.

998
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,300
I mean, like clipping a nail or something, you know?

999
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,140
And then he did it on the back of my hand once over here.

1000
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,820
And once right over here, same tool.

1001
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:13,260
I don't know if they could pick up two different pieces of flesh, but

1002
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:17,100
it does, we use the same tool, but it in the other one corked it and did that.

1003
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,820
And they walked over for a second and talked a few more moments.

1004
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,940
And then they turned around and said, uh, thank you, you know, but, uh, you

1005
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,860
know, you're done, you know, you can go back over to the commander's office.

1006
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:28,860
Now you can get dressed.

1007
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,740
I said, yes, sir.

1008
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,220
Thank you.

1009
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:33,100
Okay.

1010
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:38,020
So when I looked back up, OSI had, they had, they had gone.

1011
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:41,740
So there was a driver in the, in the, in, uh, Colonel Spraker's vehicle.

1012
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:46,460
He was waiting on me when I got dressed and went back out there, uh, I got in a

1013
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:51,100
vehicle and went straight back to Colonel Spraker's office where OSI was there.

1014
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:55,380
So Colonel Spraker, uh, asked some more and every time I would ask about Michael

1015
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:58,500
Johnson, they tell, they kept telling me, don't worry about Michael Johnson.

1016
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,140
He's fine.

1017
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:00,260
He's fine.

1018
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,100
Really bothered me.

1019
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:03,700
Yeah.

1020
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:04,540
It just, I just.

1021
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,180
It almost sounds like they're covering for something.

1022
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:11,460
And, uh, Oh, when I did go back to Colonel Spraker's office again, I had to

1023
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:18,500
go and do a formal report in again and, uh, do everything I was told.

1024
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:22,100
Then he told me I could sit down in front of him, which I did.

1025
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:28,340
And then the, uh, the captain Jack Reed walked over to his desk, Colonel Spraker's

1026
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:32,020
desk and handed him the paper and he said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1027
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:32,500
I'm sorry.

1028
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:32,980
I'm sorry.

1029
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:36,700
I walked over to his desk, Colonel Spraker's desk and handed him the paperwork.

1030
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:44,580
And, uh, at the same time, Colonel Spraker handed me these reporting forms.

1031
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:48,180
I don't know what, I don't know the number, but he handed me these,

1032
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,500
he handed me these forms.

1033
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:53,740
He said, I need you to write down every single thing that happened on that site

1034
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:58,300
tonight from the time you got this alarm to the completion, you know, and I went,

1035
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:03,780
Oh, I mean, I print very well and I'm pretty detailed and I'll be happy to do that.

1036
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:09,060
Again, I omitted what I saw at my right window, so I never got a copy of that.

1037
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,980
They would not let me have a copy of that.

1038
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:16,020
And, um, which I found kind of odd because anytime, any other time, you know,

1039
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:19,860
you get article 15 or something, you get a copy of it, you know, something bad

1040
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:23,340
that you've done, and again, I felt as if I'd done something incorrect or wrong.

1041
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:25,260
Cause I knew I didn't strike that site.

1042
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:28,300
And that seemed to be a big question is why didn't you strike this site?

1043
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:33,740
Uh, of course they had some, they had to have somebody address that alarm.

1044
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,900
I don't know who or how, but they did.

1045
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:39,140
But then Jack Reed walked over and handed him this other piece of paper

1046
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:40,660
as he was putting mine down.

1047
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:45,180
And it was, uh, like a non-disclosure agreement, but I don't even think

1048
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,100
they had that terminology then.

1049
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:51,420
I just think it was something that I was told for one, this was a,

1050
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,860
this was now a classified incident.

1051
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,340
That's what I was told.

1052
01:06:55,340 --> 01:07:00,420
And I was agreeing to that and that I would not speak to any type of, uh,

1053
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:03,220
they didn't even use the word social media.

1054
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:05,900
It was like media people at any time.

1055
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,980
If anybody comes into the missile field, you don't talk to anyone period.

1056
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,380
You don't even tell your wife.

1057
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:15,500
And now she thought it was odd because I should have been gone, come back

1058
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,700
in the morning of the fourth day.

1059
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:20,660
I had just departed the day before then this happened that night.

1060
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:24,620
And then I wasn't allowed to call her until about three o'clock when

1061
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:25,700
everything was said and done.

1062
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,700
And I agreed to that agreement.

1063
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:35,340
So Rick Doty's job, what he later said when I questioned him about it was

1064
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:44,620
he was there, he was brought in to go over, sent over to the flight

1065
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:50,300
surgeon's office to pick up our medical records, mine and Michael Johnson's.

1066
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:53,140
Now I had no idea Michael Johnson was even over there.

1067
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,500
If he was truly there or not, I'm really not sure.

1068
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:56,540
I never saw him.

1069
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,500
I didn't see Michael again.

1070
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:03,660
As I said, for about 18 days, but, uh, he was there to study.

1071
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,660
So you did see Michael 18 days later.

1072
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:05,940
Yeah.

1073
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:11,340
He, he was there to pick up just our medical records and bring them back to

1074
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:17,980
his officer, which I find, I just find indifference with that, you know, there

1075
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:20,060
had to be something said about what just happened.

1076
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:24,340
I mean, for one, it was an incident of security being that we didn't do what

1077
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:27,180
we were supposed to do and we had five hours of missing time, they have to

1078
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:31,140
account to that for somebody, somebody higher than that base commander or

1079
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:35,020
deputy base commander and that, and that squadron commander, they had to address

1080
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:40,180
somebody say, right, Pat or wherever they have, they have to up channel

1081
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:42,340
reporting has to take place that incident.

1082
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:44,260
Um,

1083
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,860
so I was able to call her at about three o'clock and she picked me up and she

1084
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:50,300
sees me, I got a bandaid up here and I got one on the back of my hand.

1085
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:50,780
What happened?

1086
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:51,540
I can't tell her.

1087
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,620
And I, and I had to stick with that.

1088
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:56,220
And I said, just something happened.

1089
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:59,500
And I said, my partner and I, we were brought back in, you know, to, well,

1090
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,300
I'll go back out.

1091
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:01,780
So I got extra days off.

1092
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:04,540
We'll go back out on the next rotation, but I never went back to the women

1093
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,100
control.

1094
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:08,900
They sent me to kilo control under the scrutiny of my flight chief and

1095
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:12,580
assistant flight chief and the OIC, which was the flight control team.

1096
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:18,660
And the OIC, which was a lieutenant over all the missile, over everything

1097
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:19,740
out there in that sector.

1098
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:26,500
Um, and he had a, he had a hit, not a name, but he had a, um, a terminology,

1099
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:30,780
not a flight chief, but an officer in charge, uh, the flight operations.

1100
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:31,700
I'm not sure.

1101
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:35,300
And he stayed there, uh, at kilo control.

1102
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:39,300
And of course I was a member then never a team leader again, until the day I,

1103
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,140
nine months later, I got my assignment to go to Korea.

1104
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:50,020
But getting back to that about two and a half, three weeks later, we're living

1105
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,020
in, it's called Haines way apartments.

1106
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,740
They're still there today in Rapid city.

1107
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:01,100
I get this bar none kid you not.

1108
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:04,300
When that not came with that door, I knew it was Michael Johnson.

1109
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:09,700
I knew it was that man and I'd never met him or had him in any kind of a, other

1110
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,380
than sitting in the cab of that truck, which I know he only said like three

1111
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:16,180
words to me, whatever man and outside too, or I don't know what it is.

1112
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:19,300
And that was back at the site when I was flashing the lights at it.

1113
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:23,340
That's all he'd ever said to me, other than the fact that, uh, in the day

1114
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:26,660
room or on the way out on a bus, he'd said he was from Chicago, Illinois.

1115
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:29,820
Uh, his, he was not married and he lived in the barracks.

1116
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:32,740
I knew that he knocks on my door open.

1117
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,260
I said, Michael, how you doing, man?

1118
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,140
I said, come on in here.

1119
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:37,260
We got to talk, you know, band-aids are off.

1120
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:38,620
Had no more marks.

1121
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,620
It was sunburned kind of thing.

1122
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:41,300
It was more Mark.

1123
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,700
What he did, what he took off than there was when the skin healed.

1124
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,580
So, which was nothing.

1125
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,540
I'm old Tampa boys.

1126
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:52,940
I'm used to sunburn, you know, I look like this in the summertime, but, um,

1127
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:57,900
he came in and I said, I introduced him to my wife and I said, all right,

1128
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:58,780
this is what we're going to do.

1129
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:03,140
And he looked at me and I said, I want you to draw what you saw and

1130
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,300
I'm going to draw what I saw.

1131
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:08,460
Now I hadn't drawn anything up to that time, other than pyramids and

1132
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:11,740
trying to find out what the hell a pyramid, what it is, what it does

1133
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:14,180
and what's supposed to be or why.

1134
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:18,940
Real quick, before you say what you both draw, was he in a normal state again?

1135
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:20,860
He was, he was talking, it was cool.

1136
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:21,780
And like, okay.

1137
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,340
Yeah, he was, he was cool.

1138
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:27,180
He was still reserved, but he was cool, you know, cause we didn't

1139
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:28,260
really know each other that well.

1140
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:36,460
And, uh, so he comes in and he meets my wife and I think I put him at the kitchen

1141
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:40,020
table, we had a round kitchen table and I sat at the coffee table on the couch

1142
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:43,860
and I started drawing, you know, the craft, what I saw, you know, and.

1143
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:51,780
We, we talked about, you know, what we heard, what I heard everything.

1144
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:55,260
He saw the craft.

1145
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:00,340
He saw the black sphere in front of the vehicle jumping up and down.

1146
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,660
He smelled the smell.

1147
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:04,460
He heard, do not fear.

1148
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:08,460
He heard all of that and saw every bit of it, but couldn't do nothing about it.

1149
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:12,900
It was as if he was just literally turned off and couldn't respond to anything.

1150
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,580
He felt everything.

1151
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,060
I ran that finger in his ear that deep.

1152
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:22,620
I felt really bad about that, but I just wanted him to know that I was trying.

1153
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:23,220
I was checking it.

1154
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:26,420
He knew that I was checking him from what, you know, what was going on, you know,

1155
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:28,100
but he couldn't do nothing about it.

1156
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:32,500
He couldn't undo himself or just move.

1157
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,340
So how'd you guys leave it?

1158
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:36,420
So did you draw, you drew very similar things?

1159
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,540
Yeah, we drew the exact same pictures and everything.

1160
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,860
Could we see the pictures and show the audience?

1161
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,740
Well, I, I, I do have the drawings.

1162
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:42,980
Yeah.

1163
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:46,220
I don't have them from him, but I've got my rendition of them.

1164
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:56,980
That's remarkable.

1165
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:59,620
And then after that, what happens between you and Michael?

1166
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:02,380
We were there an hour, hour and a half, and it was a good, good,

1167
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:04,100
and it was good vibes all the way through.

1168
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:07,300
He had some tea or something and we talked some more.

1169
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,020
We said, Hey, well, we need to get together again and chat some more.

1170
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:10,420
You know?

1171
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,940
And he said, yeah, I agree with that.

1172
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:13,900
That was the last time I ever saw him.

1173
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:15,340
You couldn't get in touch after that.

1174
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:16,180
No, she tried.

1175
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:16,740
No.

1176
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:17,380
Uh, yeah.

1177
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,260
Yeah.

1178
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,260
I don't know where he went.

1179
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:20,620
I don't know what happened to him.

1180
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,060
I don't know if he was sent somewhere else.

1181
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,500
It wasn't eight months later.

1182
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:27,380
Well, it was about seven months, six months later, I got promoted to an

1183
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:29,740
NCO non-commissioned officer buck sergeant.

1184
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:33,420
So I know he had to go, he, he outranked me by two months.

1185
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:38,620
So he had to be upgraded also or promoted to an NCO.

1186
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:41,860
And, uh, have you tried looking up his records?

1187
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,100
Yeah, everything, anything and everything.

1188
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:44,940
You can't find anything.

1189
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,100
I can't find a damn thing.

1190
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:50,020
Do you think the guy in the gray tweed suit, you know, I think Bob Jacobs

1191
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,100
talked about two guys in great tweed suits.

1192
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:54,380
I think he was a GS government service employee.

1193
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:55,020
Okay.

1194
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:58,180
And so he was probably Bob and I talked about that too.

1195
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:00,180
So he was probably the highest ranking guy in the room.

1196
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:00,700
Yeah.

1197
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:01,900
Well, I don't know.

1198
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,180
I mean, for GS service perhaps.

1199
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:09,380
Um, but, uh, Colonel Spraker was the highest ranking in that room.

1200
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,740
And I don't remember the rank of the deputy base commander.

1201
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:17,940
If you have 170, you know, people seeing a thing around nuclear bases and they're

1202
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:22,220
all told to sign non-disclosures after they see a thing, what do you think the real

1203
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:26,420
number is given how many thousands of people have worked at nuclear bases, you

1204
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:31,180
know, in the 70 year plus American nuclear program history?

1205
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:33,180
You think it's over a thousand?

1206
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:33,820
It has to be.

1207
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:38,500
I would say that anybody even today where then they're, they're still active.

1208
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,940
You know, uh, Ellsworth has been decommissioned on the missile side.

1209
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:46,980
I think that was in 1992 and the only missile that ever flew out of the

1210
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:50,780
ground and the minute man program was at November two, where I was located,

1211
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:52,820
not during my time, but in the sixties.

1212
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,980
And I believe it flew for five seconds.

1213
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:58,140
It was detonated, you know, a dummy warhead, you know, they just, they

1214
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,340
wanted to make sure that it would launch out of the silo.

1215
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:00,900
That's all.

1216
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:08,260
Mind's eye view from every one of those sites are standalone sites.

1217
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:12,060
Those missiles are standalone with that launch control facility.

1218
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:17,500
So when each launch control facility, you've got 10, 1.2 megaton missile

1219
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:20,020
systems sitting in the ground all around you.

1220
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:22,380
I mean, up to miles away from you.

1221
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:26,140
As I said, you know, November five was the closest launch

1222
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:27,980
facility to November control.

1223
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:34,340
If you have the technology to shut off one missile or to alarm one missile,

1224
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:38,020
would you not know that that's the shortest response time?

1225
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:42,820
And this is really reaching, but why didn't they set off November 10 or

1226
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:48,580
November nine up by Castle Rock or why didn't we know why was it they didn't

1227
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:52,900
have no time to spare or what they just set off November five and knew we were

1228
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:56,820
coming, I literally, I really do think that, I mean, I don't think it was

1229
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:01,260
they knew, I think they know they can see the power grid under the ground because

1230
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:04,220
everything out there is underground, everything.

1231
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:06,420
That's why they, that's how they keep power on in the wintertime.

1232
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,060
They built underground all these years.

1233
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:12,900
Also the response on the human side for you feels oddly routine.

1234
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:17,820
If that were like the first or only incident that had ever happened, you'd

1235
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:22,260
think that, you know, the, the superior superiors would be freaked out, right?

1236
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:26,340
Like it's like you have nuclear missile silos, like, you know, these are, you

1237
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:31,260
know, it's, it's, it's, it's our, you know, top of the food chain when it comes to

1238
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:36,340
American defense and offense or so we think there are other variations and I

1239
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:41,980
think they in turn gauge our overall knowledge on splitting the atom and

1240
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:46,500
what's in those two hemishells, what source we're using, where it's no matter

1241
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,900
if it's plutonium, it's uranium or what it is.

1242
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:50,580
And I worked at those facilities too.

1243
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:54,780
I was with USDA for quite some time also as a security inspector.

1244
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,980
So I've been through a lot of these laboratories.

1245
01:16:56,980 --> 01:17:01,740
I've been to Los Alamos, Sandia, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Y-12

1246
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:05,940
facility, Oak Ridge gaseous diffusion facility and general electric neutron

1247
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:09,580
devices where triggering mechanisms were built, RTGs.

1248
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:13,900
So where, where, where were you at GE, Schenectady, New York?

1249
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:15,500
No, Largo, Florida.

1250
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:15,980
Okay.

1251
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:18,740
That was their DOE facility, which is now decommissioned.

1252
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:19,740
They don't do it any longer.

1253
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:24,340
They made the triggering device there that, that is used that you can see on.

1254
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:30,060
It's clear whatever's going on on the UFO side is very interested in not only

1255
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:35,180
nuclear weapons, but it seems like nuclear energy, anything in which we use an atom

1256
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:39,700
for, but I honestly think that they gauge our intelligence on that in some way.

1257
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,460
And that's why they're so closely scrutinized.

1258
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:45,140
The other thing that's funny, I think they have a sense of humor.

1259
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:49,540
And the reason I think that is when you get all these sites that are shut down

1260
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:53,180
and everybody scrambles together, they're all offline and everything, like what

1261
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:58,940
happened to Robert Salas for instance, and his commander, the flip side of that

1262
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:04,100
is when one of these sites alarm and start its countdown as it's going to launch.

1263
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:11,060
So the response to that, once you're dispatched, if, if the launch crew wants

1264
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:15,220
to dispatch you, if they're really worried because they have an override also that

1265
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:20,620
they can do something with, and I don't know exactly how that works, but they're

1266
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:24,660
dispatch you to the site with your F-154 pickup truck and all your goodies.

1267
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:26,500
You've got your diddy bag, your weapon, your stuff.

1268
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:28,700
You're ready for it to be out there for two weeks.

1269
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:32,420
If you have to, every time you leave, you can stay out in that missile field

1270
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,580
for a very long time period.

1271
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:40,740
The missile is counting itself down.

1272
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:42,260
It's going to launch.

1273
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:48,180
You take, and you go to the site, you open up the gates, you drive your

1274
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:52,020
vehicle right up on top of the blast door, which is at ground level, right

1275
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:56,500
on top of an octagon shaped nine ton door and sit right on top of that site,

1276
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:59,860
right on top of that blast door, put your vehicle in neutral.

1277
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:06,140
If you can find a rock big enough, chalk both tires, just chalk one front, one

1278
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:09,580
back so it don't roll if there's a little bit of lean to one of the, one of the

1279
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:11,820
doors or something, so I'll be retold.

1280
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:18,500
Grab your stuff, get off that site and set up a one mile ECP entry control

1281
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:24,300
point and wait for further orders in hopes that if this thing cannot be stopped

1282
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:28,620
or overridden, when that, when that blast door blows out from underneath that

1283
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:32,780
vehicle, it's going to fall down on top of that, on top of that rocket.

1284
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:38,340
And all it's in hopes to do is to damage it, to offset its guidance control.

1285
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,820
So it'll just go off aimlessly like a scud and crash.

1286
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:46,100
That's what it, that's what they do and get down to 10 or 15 seconds and it

1287
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,340
stops, then everything's normal again.

1288
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:50,100
Crazy.

1289
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:52,860
And people rolling up on these sites have sometimes seen those

1290
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,300
crafts and they blow away.

1291
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:59,780
And then that happens, you know, I would venture to say that there were

1292
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:03,300
800 security policemen at Ellsworth airport space while I was there.

1293
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:06,540
That's standard configuration.

1294
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:10,260
That's not an operational readiness inspection or anything like that.

1295
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:13,580
They were just normally 800 or right there about security

1296
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:16,340
policemen, law enforcement and, or security.

1297
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:23,540
Anybody that worked on that missile field, I would say, I would say one out

1298
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:28,460
of every four has probably seen something in the night sky because everybody

1299
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:31,580
works rotating shifts, whether they report it or tell their partner

1300
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:35,180
about it is up to them, but I'd venture to say it's that frequent.

1301
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:38,260
That's why, and that's just that Ellsworth that doesn't include

1302
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:45,300
Minot, that doesn't include, uh, uh, Malmstrom or Effie Warren in Wyoming.

1303
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:52,580
I've been told or asked just recently if I'd appear before Congress and I, and I

1304
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:57,380
would, I would appear before Congress and I know that's pretty hair raising for a

1305
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:07,140
lot of people, but when they get all the scientists and all the pilots and everything

1306
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:10,940
else out of the way with these huge credentials, I was just a security

1307
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,620
policeman at 23 years of age.

1308
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:16,340
I have a high school education, have some college.

1309
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:19,700
I've been most mostly technical schools all my life.

1310
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:24,020
And I really try to read a lot and do a lot of things to educate myself further.

1311
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:28,540
It just didn't work out for me being able to do the things, you know,

1312
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:29,860
going to college and so forth.

1313
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:35,300
When they're done with all of that and they want a real up close and personal

1314
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,340
account, then they got to come to me sooner or later.

1315
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:43,780
And you don't have to put that in that, in this, but you know, that's what

1316
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:46,340
somebody from up there told me.

1317
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:50,340
I said, eventually they got to hear somebody that's had a close and

1318
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:53,180
personal, uh, time with these things.

1319
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:59,460
So being that I was on duty, I was a prime candidate for that as I've been told.

1320
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:01,620
And I wish I had more witnesses.

1321
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:04,380
I wish there were people that could just pull up out of nowhere, you

1322
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:05,460
know, that were there.

1323
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:09,140
But you know, there's just so much time has passed, you know, we've been through

1324
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:11,700
so much with COVID and everything else.

1325
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,340
I don't know.

1326
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:18,580
What about, what about the guy you said you were buddies with where you ran in

1327
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:22,340
and you started signaling what you thought was a B 52 at the time?

1328
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:22,860
What was his name?

1329
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:23,620
Bill Holliman.

1330
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:24,220
Bill Holliman.

1331
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:25,260
Are you still in touch with Bill?

1332
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:28,500
Well, I know it was William, William something Holliman.

1333
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:31,300
We called him Bill and he was from North Carolina.

1334
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:34,300
I have searched how many names are the last name of Holliman.

1335
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:34,940
I don't know.

1336
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:39,140
And that's the only way I've even, but have, did you even speak to him one

1337
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:42,660
on one after that being like, remember when we signaled the thing, I was never,

1338
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:44,860
uh, I never went back to November control.

1339
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:47,300
They sent me to Kelo control.

1340
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:48,580
They just completely separated us.

1341
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:52,660
I never saw Michael Johnson again until about, uh, three weeks later.

1342
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:56,180
So they just separated you and how far is Kelo control from November?

1343
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:00,060
Well, yeah, honestly, it's a sister flight, but it's where the supervision

1344
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:01,940
hang their hat at nights.

1345
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:06,900
Instead of us being at November control or any of the, or Oscar flight or any

1346
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:10,540
of the other flights where you don't have the supervision of a flight chief

1347
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:15,140
and assistant flight chief, uh, you do it Kelo.

1348
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:19,300
So they have a way of monitoring, watching every single thing that you do.

1349
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:21,500
And also the OIC.

1350
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,460
And so you just never saw Bill again?

1351
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:27,260
Uh, no, maybe a guard mount once or twice.

1352
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:28,420
Hey Bill, that kind of thing.

1353
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,020
Just passing.

1354
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:30,980
You ever say, Hey Bill, you know, what about that?

1355
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:33,620
I wanted to, but it never really presented itself.

1356
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:37,060
And there were a couple of other guys there, even that Sergeant Garza.

1357
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:42,500
Uh, I'd love to have spoken with him again because, uh, and he was from Texas.

1358
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:46,740
I remember that we talked about it and, uh, cause I was just that

1359
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:50,620
close born in Port Arthur, but I was born in Virginia and my parents

1360
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:53,260
and they moved to, uh, to Port Arthur.

1361
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,740
My dad could ship in and out of there.

1362
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:57,940
And you received a hypnotic regression about all of this, right?

1363
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:58,540
I did.

1364
01:23:58,660 --> 01:23:59,500
I certainly did.

1365
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:03,700
Um, uh, Bob Upton did my first one and Yvonne Smith did my second one.

1366
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:04,580
What came out?

1367
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:13,300
Uh, well, the, the, uh, the inside of the craft, what was that like?

1368
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:22,700
I I've got some drawings of it, but what I saw or what I experienced in my mind,

1369
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:26,860
uh, was not all pleasant.

1370
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:33,860
And these, these were the, the one that was messing with me was a very tall one

1371
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:41,620
that was doing the, you know, one thing to me, whereas in regression number two,

1372
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:49,060
I found out that Michael was laying opposite to me and there was one of the

1373
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:51,700
short ones or small ones between us both.

1374
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:56,540
And, uh, he was facing one direction.

1375
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:59,780
I was facing the opposite direction, kind of like, like that would be.

1376
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:02,860
And, uh, what were they doing?

1377
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:04,820
Were they doing taking samples or?

1378
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:09,220
Well, the tall one did something to my wrist and I kept telling him how to hurt

1379
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:15,860
me and he, and, uh, he told me, he said something, you know, we don't hurt you

1380
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:16,860
or something like that.

1381
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:17,940
I don't remember.

1382
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:19,580
I'd have to go back and listen to it again.

1383
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:22,820
I, I don't even listen to my first regression session for a year.

1384
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:28,420
I was so afraid of what I, what I would hear or what I would find out or what I

1385
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:34,100
would see in the actual incident itself that when I, when I sat down from inside

1386
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:42,500
that window, I want you to know that the words do not fear travel through my body

1387
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:51,340
like a vibration, like, uh, uh, like a hiss, a telepathic, I don't know, but I

1388
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:57,140
kept hearing over and over, do not fear, do not fear, uh, do not fear.

1389
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:05,380
And was it a good vibe or bad as far as your, it was, it was, it was complete.

1390
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:10,460
It was as if, you know, when somebody says something, you'll say, uh, what or

1391
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:13,060
huh, there's none of that.

1392
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:17,100
There's no misinterpretation of someone speaking to, you know, exactly what's

1393
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:21,660
being said, was there, was there sort of a sense of their intention as positive

1394
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:28,980
or negative, or was it assuring, assuring, I think no matter what you see visually,

1395
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:29,820
do not fear.

1396
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:35,300
And that's what we seem to have the hardest problem with is what we're seeing visually.

1397
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:39,340
If you had kind of a best guess, do you think they had positive intentions or

1398
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:43,620
negative or I think they had positive, but they fulfill their mission, whatever

1399
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:49,180
that mission is, whether it's to obtain DNA material or what have you, or some

1400
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:54,340
kind of a programming or I don't know any, whatever they want to do, they're

1401
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:58,460
going to do outside of like the obvious, which is you experienced this kind of

1402
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:00,900
crazy paranormal disruption in your life.

1403
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:05,580
Uh, did this kind of, was this an inflection point or did it change your

1404
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:07,420
life in a dramatic way afterwards?

1405
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:12,580
How so I had to find out everything about archeology and pyramids.

1406
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:17,700
And so that was just something that it almost felt like it was installed

1407
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,100
inside of you or downloaded.

1408
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:20,260
Yes.

1409
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:24,180
And why, still today, why do you think you became so interested in that?

1410
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:25,140
I have no idea.

1411
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:29,540
Do you know that, um, the air force, uh, paid for this movie called star gate.

1412
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:30,460
Have you ever seen this movie?

1413
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:31,220
Absolutely.

1414
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:34,420
So, you know, there's a star gate in the pyramid.

1415
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:37,180
It's sort of this portal, this like time travel machine.

1416
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:42,340
Do you think that might be related to, you know, why you're so interested in

1417
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:42,940
pyramids?

1418
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:49,460
I think they were power generators and whatever they generated power to was

1419
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:55,060
worldwide, and I think it was at a time in which we have been completely blacked

1420
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:57,220
out from, have you heard of Christopher Dunn?

1421
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:57,860
I have.

1422
01:27:58,540 --> 01:27:58,940
Yes.

1423
01:27:58,980 --> 01:27:59,700
An engineer.

1424
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:00,340
Yes, I have.

1425
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:01,460
What do you think of his theory?

1426
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:03,260
I think his theory is absolutely correct.

1427
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:05,460
Uh, Robert shock.

1428
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,300
And I think, absolutely.

1429
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:11,380
I think, uh, the erosion marks on that grace finks and everything else around it.

1430
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:16,660
Can you, can you recapitulate or can you retell Christopher Dunn theory

1431
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:17,700
just for the audience?

1432
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:25,420
Well, the, the archeological tools in which was used to create, uh, and, and.

1433
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:32,300
Carver cut this granite or not in the archeological, uh, array of tools of

1434
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:39,620
copper and wooden chisels today in some form of, of, uh, advanced mathematics

1435
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:42,180
was used in order to create what they did.

1436
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:45,900
And even just the placement of the pyramid, great pyramid itself.

1437
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:49,220
I mean, the entire plateau is the only place they can support that way.

1438
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:54,300
And the entire plateau was built before the pyramids were placed on top of it.

1439
01:28:55,380 --> 01:29:01,380
So who had that technology and what was used to who, who, who mandated that?

1440
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:07,340
What Pharaoh woke up one morning after his dates and whatever else he ate and

1441
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:11,500
he said, ah, let's build that plateau so it can hold, uh, how many millions

1442
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:12,620
of pounds is this thing way?

1443
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:17,900
I have no idea right now, but I mean, 750 feet from edge from corner to

1444
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:20,060
corner and what 432 feet high.

1445
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:20,620
Is that right?

1446
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:25,980
Uh, on 13 acres.

1447
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:27,420
I mean, how, how can that be?

1448
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:31,940
Do you think the beings you experienced are aliens or do you think they're humans

1449
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:36,740
or what exactly did the alien, what exactly did the entities you encountered

1450
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:37,260
look like?

1451
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:39,940
Oh, they look like grays.

1452
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:43,540
They look like the small grays, but the one behind them, I guess you would

1453
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:47,500
classify him as a tall gray on Whitley Strieber's book communion.

1454
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:52,740
Of course, the first time I saw that picture, I froze in my, I froze in my, in

1455
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:57,340
my stride and I had to have that book and, uh, Barnes and Noble or wherever

1456
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:59,020
it was at the time when it came out.

1457
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:03,700
And I literally, before I opened the first to the first page, I literally

1458
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:09,780
just sat and stared at that picture for many hours before I ever even read his

1459
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:10,220
book.

1460
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:13,460
Do you think that there, there's actually a line from communion by

1461
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:17,660
Whitley Strieber where, uh, it's like this weird joke, you know, he actually,

1462
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:23,260
I think he or his wife comments on how ugly, uh, the aliens are and the alien

1463
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:26,900
turns back and he goes, uh, someday soon, my dear, you'll look like us.

1464
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:30,940
So it's this implication that actually we're kind of turning into these beings.

1465
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:34,780
In 10,000 years, will we have these smaller appendages, our little fingers,

1466
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:39,780
our little toes, how will our bodies be at that particular point in time?

1467
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:41,580
You know, how will our diets change?

1468
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:42,780
How will light change?

1469
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:45,580
How will radiation that affects our atmosphere today?

1470
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:47,340
How will it change in the future?

1471
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:52,420
How will it change us completely as we become a space faring civilization?

1472
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:56,940
And we will be in, you know, whatever, whenever that could take place, we,

1473
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:57,980
we will do that.

1474
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:03,180
Uh, how will that change us without the gravity that we, that we undergo today

1475
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:08,860
and, and the things in which we live with today, you know, radio waves, 5g,

1476
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:10,420
everything has an effect on you.

1477
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:12,940
So you think these beings could be us from the future?

1478
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,460
No, I don't think they are.

1479
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:16,500
I don't think we're going to be there.

1480
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,540
I don't think we're that lucky.

1481
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:19,940
So what do you think they are?

1482
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:21,740
Do you think they're from another dimension or?

1483
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:22,580
They could be.

1484
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:25,180
I mean, the technology is wide open.

1485
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:27,540
Anything you can imagine probably is.

1486
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:29,060
What was the craft like?

1487
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:30,740
So you're, you're in the inside of this thing.

1488
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:31,820
What did it look like?

1489
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:34,140
A beehive.

1490
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:35,780
Beehive.

1491
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:36,100
Yeah.

1492
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:36,740
How so?

1493
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:42,580
Well, there were, uh, from my looking around as I did in that playground, like

1494
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:50,780
I always try to take a mental picture of something, they were just multi-levels

1495
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:55,980
with, with all these small grays everywhere going to and fro and doing

1496
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:56,780
whatever they were doing.

1497
01:31:56,780 --> 01:32:00,420
I just got to look for a moment and I was following one and even the

1498
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:07,100
floor and the boards around the bottom of the floor, uh, had energy was

1499
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:11,060
everything emanated power in some way.

1500
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:15,620
Uh, the walls, uh, was there a humming associated?

1501
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:16,700
Not that I can remember.

1502
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:21,820
And it almost felt like the tall gray was maybe in charge of these smaller grays.

1503
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:22,500
Absolutely.

1504
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:23,340
In that room.

1505
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:27,100
Another thing too, I was not on a table.

1506
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:38,260
I was, uh, from my memory, I was on some type of a, uh, I was like wrapped in a

1507
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:45,220
triangular kind of, uh, beam or something that was body length, about four foot in

1508
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:53,620
the air and, uh, as like a, a, a strange light would not a strange light.

1509
01:32:56,620 --> 01:33:01,180
It's even hard to describe, but it was as if I was inserted in something that

1510
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:06,980
was some type of a force field or some kind of a, a holding field that they

1511
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:12,780
could move you around in like a gurney without wheels, a table without a back

1512
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:15,220
or, or wheels or legs attached to it.

1513
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:20,220
And I felt as if, you know, they, when they reached in or when he lifted my

1514
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:27,380
arm up, lifted me up right here on my wrist, you know, it exited that, that

1515
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:33,540
pyramidal field or whatever it was above me and it was in his atmosphere at that

1516
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:38,820
time, uh, in my, in hypnosis, that's what I saw.

1517
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:42,140
The other thing was, this is mess interesting.

1518
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:50,860
I, uh, I'm taken to a room when I first get there, I'm taken into this room.

1519
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:54,460
If you can call it a room, everything's generated, everything's power gen,

1520
01:33:54,460 --> 01:34:00,500
there's power on every wall, every nook and cranny, where no buttons or, or, or

1521
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:06,220
places to insert a tape or anything like that, but the whole place is like, is

1522
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:13,340
powered and there were all these old things like a sewing machine table with

1523
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:18,820
a singer sewing machine on it, those old 50 style lamps that went from the floor

1524
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:23,540
to the ceiling and had bulbs sticking off of them like that, TV and a cabinet.

1525
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:26,220
It was like an antique shop for future.

1526
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:32,940
Yeah, like a museum and a, and a, and this is, uh, uh, old wooden box radio.

1527
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:39,940
And I found that to be so cool because I ended up buying a, a US RKO radio

1528
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:45,700
in a mahogany cabinet that worked with tubes from a rancher there in South

1529
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:48,820
Dakota that I wish I'd have never had wooden knobs and everything on it and

1530
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:54,660
worked beautifully and, uh, that from that, from when I saw that I had to

1531
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:58,500
have one of these damn radios, I don't know why, but this one was much nicer

1532
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:02,580
than what I saw, but iron, a steam iron standing.

1533
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:07,660
I drew pictures of, of, of it, the best of my recollection of everything.

1534
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:11,100
And then I was told in the, in the very back of the room, there was a round

1535
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:14,740
window, but it looked like, it looked like it was a, it was a round window

1536
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:18,380
with a slice taken out of it, like a pie without, with a slice removed from it.

1537
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:23,020
And I was told I could go look out that window, but I was too afraid to walk

1538
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:27,420
over there and look out of it for some reason I didn't, I don't know why, but I

1539
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:32,660
mean, but I felt at ease, but I still didn't want to know, or didn't want to

1540
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:36,980
see out that window, something really bothered me and about looking out that

1541
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:37,340
window.

1542
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:41,060
And I was told that twice that I could go look out the window and I didn't.

1543
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:48,380
So then I was told to follow and to follow when I did, I followed a small

1544
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:58,220
gray in front of me, little eggs and, uh, like a little gray type, uh, like

1545
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:01,180
spandex suit or something on, on, I guess.

1546
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:05,380
I mean, these, these things are so foreign to you.

1547
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:08,260
There's this, this whole visual concept is so foreign to you.

1548
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:11,740
It's very hard to find words for a lot of it, even after 44 years.

1549
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:12,860
And it's just difficult.

1550
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:17,780
And I went, I followed him, went, turned left in this small little opening

1551
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:21,140
area and went into this room where it was just fogged.

1552
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:27,020
And then that's where my memories end, but that's where the thing was done to

1553
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:35,100
my wrist and then I don't know from that point on, I had seemed to be right

1554
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:36,060
around the end of it.

1555
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:40,060
Did it feel like a dream-like state or did it feel physical in this

1556
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:41,260
hypnotic regression?

1557
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:42,620
Oh no, it felt physical.

1558
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:43,220
It felt real.

1559
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:47,300
The, uh, the first time I was hypnotized, which was, uh, Robert Upton, Bob

1560
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:54,780
Upton, uh, I had, I had a pretty bad time because I never, I'm not a person

1561
01:36:54,780 --> 01:36:57,140
ever thinking that I could be hypnotized to start with.

1562
01:36:57,740 --> 01:37:02,620
I'm pretty strong-willed and, and, uh, I feel as if I'm common-sensed also.

1563
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:06,060
And, and I just thought, oh, hypnosis is for someone else.

1564
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:09,780
It's just not for me, but, uh, Robert wanted me to try it.

1565
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:11,060
So I said, okay.

1566
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:15,540
And, and, uh, the funny thing, cause, uh, we had been through a hurricane

1567
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:19,900
just prior to that down in Brunswick, Georgia, and I had some roof damage

1568
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:22,660
and deck damage on the back of my home.

1569
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:25,620
And they were reroofing my house that day.

1570
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:30,380
Now, what a day to be hypnotized on by this guy who he came up from Jacksonville,

1571
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:32,020
67 miles south of me.

1572
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:44,900
And, uh, he's like the, uh, lead, uh, hypnotic regression person for a

1573
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,460
move on at the time.

1574
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:49,060
I don't know if he still is, but he has my admiration.

1575
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:50,780
I couldn't do his job.

1576
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:55,340
And he didn't get any sort of weird sense from him that he had ulterior motives.

1577
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:56,380
No, no.

1578
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:59,780
Now, now Robert Hastings had given him a set of questions that he was

1579
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:01,180
going to ask me and he told me that.

1580
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:02,220
And I was fine with that.

1581
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,220
They were reroofing my home.

1582
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:09,340
So you'd imagine there's like 15 people on my roof and I, my, my

1583
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:10,740
home has got a really steep roof.

1584
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:11,700
I couldn't do it.

1585
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:12,900
I can't even climb up there anymore.

1586
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:19,380
But so they're literally peeling off plywood and replacing plywood,

1587
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:21,500
nailers and everything else.

1588
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:22,740
Things being tossed, run up there.

1589
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:29,620
I never heard a single, a single air gun going off during that hypnosis session.

1590
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:31,020
That's why I knew I was hypnotized.

1591
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:34,420
I never heard any of that, but he took me down to a level.

1592
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:38,620
He had a way of doing it that evidently worked.

1593
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:50,100
But once I did and I confronted what I saw, I, uh, it really upset me a great

1594
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:54,540
deal, literally come into face to face and, and smelling that smell again,

1595
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:59,060
hearing those words again, uh, maybe I was, I got that deep into it

1596
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:00,380
and I never thought that I could.

1597
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:06,260
Uh, I don't know if a person's mind has changed as we had said earlier.

1598
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:09,140
I don't know if that's what happens, but

1599
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:14,180
was it cathartic at all, or was it just purely painful?

1600
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:18,020
It got painful.

1601
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:18,740
It really did.

1602
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:24,780
I mean, when, when, when I visualized and saw what was being done in my wrist

1603
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:28,220
and the way in which it was being done, it just, I mean, he could have

1604
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:30,060
cut my whole arm off, I wouldn't have known the difference.

1605
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,740
I couldn't, there's nothing I could do to stop it.

1606
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,380
You know, I mean, it could have been the end of my life right there.

1607
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:35,940
And that's how, that's how.

1608
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:38,460
Did you know implants as far as the puncture?

1609
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:39,580
Well, I have no idea.

1610
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:43,820
And those are on the other side of my body anyway, or those pock marks that, um.

1611
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:47,420
Do you still have the marks at all?

1612
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:47,660
Yeah.

1613
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:48,460
Can I see him?

1614
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:48,980
Sure.

1615
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:54,340
Right there.

1616
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:57,140
Right there.

1617
01:39:58,460 --> 01:39:59,380
Add these socks on.

1618
01:39:59,380 --> 01:39:59,780
Wow.

1619
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:01,260
Wow, wow, wow.

1620
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:02,620
Wow.

1621
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:03,380
Yeah.

1622
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:03,980
Those look.

1623
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:07,580
I mean, just like perfectly vertically aligned.

1624
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:11,660
Well, I had a doctor who's no longer with us, but like so clearly not like a spider,

1625
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:13,940
but like too, way too big for that.

1626
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:15,820
Like, you know, yeah.

1627
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:17,340
Well, what would you say?

1628
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:20,260
Like, like a couple of centimeters, maybe a centimeter.

1629
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:21,340
Dr.

1630
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:26,300
Mark Goll, um, he, he did, I had back surgery years ago and he did that.

1631
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:29,020
And we had talked, we had taught, he was a really great guy.

1632
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:33,380
Unfortunately, COVID took him way too young as it did many, many people.

1633
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:37,180
And we were sitting in my backyard one night and after he had looked at this

1634
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:39,660
and he said, you know, he said, I'm going to be honest with you, Mario.

1635
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:45,260
Cause I wanted to get something from him recorded, you know, and, uh, didn't

1636
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:50,420
have that chance to, the last time I saw him was probably 2019 and he has some

1637
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:55,140
family issues and had to go up north and where he got COVID and he died and, uh,

1638
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:59,180
his kids went to school with my kids at Frederica Academy on St.

1639
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:02,900
Simon's Island, uh, in Georgia.

1640
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:10,500
But he said, you know, what perplexed him was that there was no known life

1641
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:16,220
saving event that he could think of even including up to a car accident that

1642
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:22,380
anything would be put in there or down here to either put in something or take

1643
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:27,220
out something he said, and they're exactly the same depth and this in the

1644
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:30,860
same size, you know, top to bottom.

1645
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:35,340
He said, so I find that really odd, you know, cause they, I told him the

1646
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:38,740
whole incident what happened and he just, he's like, holy crap indicates

1647
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:42,940
a technology or paradigm of our medical understanding.

1648
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:46,900
And if you look at this up close under a microscope, which has been done

1649
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:51,900
from a pair or a magnifying scope, it has a little dimple right now, right

1650
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:55,540
in the top of it, like a, like you drop water in a, you know, drop a rock in

1651
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:59,300
water and it goes, that little dimple is right in the middle of both of them.

1652
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,540
That is really, that is really strange.

1653
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:05,140
So I don't know when these happened.

1654
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:07,740
I honestly don't, I don't remember healing from them.

1655
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:11,820
Uh, I didn't say it happened during my incident in 77.

1656
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:13,140
I don't know where they came from.

1657
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:16,460
Do you feel like you have a mission associated with this interest in

1658
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:21,700
pyramids where it's like, you know, at the time at which you're, you leave

1659
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:26,020
this earth, you want to accomplish something related to the pyramids?

1660
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:30,060
Man, that's a great question.

1661
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:32,900
Yes, I would like to know the answers.

1662
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:40,820
I would like to see those tools, you know, as, uh, as Christopher Dunn says,

1663
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:42,700
I would like to see those tools.

1664
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:47,700
And finally the admission that they had tools far greater than

1665
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:50,020
what we ever have imagined.

1666
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:55,300
And I think just like melting rock in South America and so I could say human

1667
01:42:55,300 --> 01:43:00,300
and some of the other facilities where these rocks are, you know, 13 sided

1668
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:04,420
and just an inch and a half and stuck in a hole is two feet deep all

1669
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:05,580
the way through the entire rock.

1670
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:07,660
How do you do that without softening that stone?

1671
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:11,340
Do you feel like, do you feel like these sites globally?

1672
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:16,020
I feel like this is what Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson, Robert

1673
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:20,220
Shock, all these guys are kind of getting into this idea that maybe a lot of this

1674
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:24,180
ancient geological, you know, architecture, megalithic architecture,

1675
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:28,860
that's precociously astronomically aligned in a way that we don't even understand

1676
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:34,900
today and it lines up with, you know, ice age or pre ice age, uh, you know,

1677
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:36,060
kind of vernal equinox.

1678
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:36,860
Absolutely.

1679
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:40,740
And so do you think that a lot of this architecture was, these were maybe

1680
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:45,660
kind of celestial ascent chambers that were star gates to another world?

1681
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:46,100
Sure.

1682
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:49,380
And maybe things were getting kind of gnarly or cataclysmic and

1683
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:51,140
they were portals to elsewhere.

1684
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:51,700
Elsewhere.

1685
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:53,100
Totally believe that.

1686
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:56,340
Have you ever seen the Netflix show dark by any chance?

1687
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,060
I've seen some of it, I believe.

1688
01:43:58,220 --> 01:44:02,380
So it involves, uh, missing people around nuclear bases and

1689
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,300
a secret time travel program.

1690
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:05,580
No, I got to see that.

1691
01:44:05,620 --> 01:44:05,940
Yeah.

1692
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:08,620
You should check it out because, um, I wish they'd call me.

1693
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:13,660
I'd like to know, you know, Lawrence, Lawrence Bell is so Bell aircraft.

1694
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:18,380
So they broke the sound barrier in 1947 X 15, Chuck Yeager.

1695
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:19,060
Exactly.

1696
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:23,580
And so there's an article in 1956 where they're saying we're going to beat gravity

1697
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:24,700
and it's right around the bend.

1698
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:29,940
And Lawrence Bell's quote from this article is, uh, we are already working

1699
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:33,260
with nuclear, nuclear fuels to cancel out gravity.

1700
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:37,780
And so you got to think if, if time travel is possible at any point in the

1701
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:40,260
future, it's probably always been possible.

1702
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:40,740
Right.

1703
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:44,540
And so where would we discover some sort of time travel program?

1704
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:47,780
It would probably be co-located with nuclear programs.

1705
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:48,460
Absolutely.

1706
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:50,900
So, and then how would you affect timelines?

1707
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:54,900
You might do it with, you know, particular people who represent kind of nodes or

1708
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:59,020
whatever, who get interested in things like pyramids after, you know, their

1709
01:44:59,020 --> 01:44:59,780
encounters.

1710
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:03,420
And so do you think that, you know, that's a possible explanation that maybe

1711
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:09,220
a future time travel program represents an overlay over all of these nuclear sites

1712
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:13,420
in a way that somehow, you know, might profoundly shift humanity and might also

1713
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:15,220
keep us alive.

1714
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:20,220
Because if you think about where is the center of the apocalypse, it's these

1715
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:20,980
nuclear sites.

1716
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:25,500
I mean, where, what, what's going to dictate the end of the world or not, you

1717
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:26,740
know, it's going to be these sites.

1718
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:27,660
So I have no idea.

1719
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:32,780
These are crazy speculation, but so gravity is, is very related with time and

1720
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:33,780
general relativity.

1721
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:35,460
So, you know, Lawrence Bell is right.

1722
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:38,700
And they're kind of using nuclear fuels to cancel out gravity.

1723
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:41,500
Maybe you're using nuclear fuels to mess with time too.

1724
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:46,940
It just makes you wonder how much technology that has been buried somehow or

1725
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:53,180
another has been removed from our everyday conscious thought, you know, and

1726
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:54,580
why was that removed?

1727
01:45:54,580 --> 01:45:56,460
Did we get so dangerous to ourselves?

1728
01:45:56,460 --> 01:46:02,260
I mean, unfortunately, I wish we weren't so warlike because you don't believe

1729
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:03,860
something that I believe in.

1730
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:05,300
We're supposed to go to war over that.

1731
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:10,380
I just, I just, I just disliked that so much, you know, and religion, you know,

1732
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:17,580
I don't want to get into that, but what you believe is fine with me.

1733
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:18,420
Yeah.

1734
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:20,140
What you believe is fine with me.

1735
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:22,260
What I believe is fine with me.

1736
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:24,300
And why can't it just be that?

1737
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:26,460
Do you think that, yeah, sorry.

1738
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:26,980
No, no, no.

1739
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:32,420
I do think that this technology that we're speaking of, even though we don't

1740
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:36,140
know it truly exists, it points to its existence in some way.

1741
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:40,060
And one day I think we will find the magic key somewhere.

1742
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:40,860
There's a craft.

1743
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:45,060
If it hasn't already been discovered, it's sitting in a cave somewhere or under

1744
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:49,780
the ocean somewhere under a ledge somewhere, or maybe even circling the

1745
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:51,540
planet invisible that we can't see.

1746
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:52,740
We're going to run into one day.

1747
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:53,380
I don't know.

1748
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:56,140
Well, maybe it'll happen sooner than maybe it'll happen sooner or later.

1749
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:59,060
And I, I just hope I honestly do.

1750
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:01,260
And I get asked this all the time.

1751
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:07,220
Well, you think they're going to come and defeat us and take us over.

1752
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:09,940
And, and my answer is always the same.

1753
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:14,460
Look at any civilization that's out there comes here within their own

1754
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:18,340
lifetime and leaves and goes back in their same lifetime, that's 10,000

1755
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:19,540
light years advanced to us.

1756
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:23,860
That's what Carl Sagan said that bar none.

1757
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:26,420
That's just 10,000 light years advanced to us.

1758
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:27,220
So think about that.

1759
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:30,260
We're like the ants in an ant bed and they're standing in there looking

1760
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:34,940
at us, you know, I often think about the reverse visualization that night when

1761
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:38,980
I was flipping the facility lights at that, at that craft, whatever it was

1762
01:47:38,980 --> 01:47:43,340
at the time to me, what would I have thought in my mind had I been up there

1763
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:49,300
looking down at this rectangular shape site, somebody's turning off and on

1764
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:51,020
the lights real quick and succession.

1765
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:53,940
Why would I flash back or wait a minute?

1766
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:56,780
How, how does that person down there see us up here?

1767
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:00,460
Why would they know that we're not supposed to be here or we're

1768
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:01,620
just up here observing?

1769
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:02,580
How would they know that?

1770
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:07,860
Do we find out who this guy is or a person is I should say, or what?

1771
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:08,540
I don't know.

1772
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:12,460
I've done that reverse thing a couple of times to try to give answers to myself,

1773
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:16,700
which always end up, you know, with a zero, I'm right back where I started.

1774
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:20,540
But I do want to say that where new Lake reservoir dam was,

1775
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:25,420
it's a Pythagorean triangle from November one, November five, over to

1776
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:31,260
new Lake reservoir and back to November one control, I believe based on that

1777
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:34,580
position of new Lake reservoir dam, that's where that crap was.

1778
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:38,500
It was over that body of water when I saw it, why, I don't know, but there's,

1779
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:42,660
there's always some type of a, there's a lot of sightings over water.

1780
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:43,420
Yes.

1781
01:48:43,460 --> 01:48:46,140
And the deepest part of that reservoir, I think, is only like a

1782
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:47,340
reconstruction right now.

1783
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:50,100
Cause I've been talking about it a lot for the last couple of years.

1784
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:55,340
I don't know if that's done anything, but, um, the people in Newel are really good.

1785
01:48:55,340 --> 01:49:00,980
And I, I, while we were there, uh, doing that filming, there were, uh, a couple

1786
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:03,420
of individuals we're out on Ormond road.

1787
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:05,220
That's the road that November five is on.

1788
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:06,660
It's a dirt road still today.

1789
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:09,340
And there's a golf course off to the left side of the road.

1790
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:13,380
There's a golf course on the left side of the road, and there's a golf course

1791
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:13,860
still today.

1792
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,380
And there's a golf course off to the left side of it.

1793
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:21,900
When you, when you turn out a new on the Ormond road in that day, you know, the

1794
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:25,900
town's so small that when we arrived there early in the morning to film, all

1795
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:27,220
these people started seeing us.

1796
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:32,500
So they, you know, news travels fast through there and they're great people.

1797
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:36,500
I've always, I've always had a lot of respect for those folks and, uh, great

1798
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:39,180
cooks to great Western Plains cooks, man.

1799
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:45,100
I cook some good food, but, uh, you would not believe the parade we had going up

1800
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:46,860
and down Ormond road watching this film.

1801
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:49,660
And it was the strangest thing because I had not been back to November

1802
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:51,820
five since that night.

1803
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:57,460
And the producer did not want to go directly in front of November five site

1804
01:49:57,460 --> 01:50:03,780
itself, because, uh, there's now like a small cattle processing facility on it,

1805
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:07,540
built on it, cause it's built on the bedrock and when they detonated and

1806
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:11,660
collapsed the silos in and, and returned it, they left the fencing

1807
01:50:11,660 --> 01:50:12,980
and the rock base there.

1808
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:16,980
So these ranchers used it to store hay on or do something on their cattle.

1809
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:18,660
The fencing is all still there.

1810
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:23,740
We could have used another site, but instead they went about 150

1811
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:26,340
yards, uh, to the east of the site.

1812
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:33,460
And we were looking into a plain field, you know, while I'm holding up my

1813
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:36,220
drawings and the drones over my shoulder, taking pictures of them.

1814
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:38,380
I just felt that not very good.

1815
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:42,340
And, uh, but when I got out of that vehicle and walked toward that site,

1816
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:45,180
man, that feeling came over me.

1817
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:52,220
I about went to my knees and, uh, and hypnosis when, uh, Robert Upton

1818
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:54,260
finished that hypnosis, something was wrong with me.

1819
01:50:55,260 --> 01:51:02,940
And about four days later, I went to, uh, my, uh, pulmonologist, uh, and I was

1820
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:09,180
in AFib and, uh, so I had to go in the next day because my heart was out of

1821
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:12,940
rhythm, never had any heart problems whatsoever ever in my life.

1822
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:13,900
I've always been an athlete.

1823
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:19,380
And, uh, of course they put the, the patches on and shot me and sync

1824
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:24,940
resynced me, I guess, and, uh, about a week went by and I started thinking

1825
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:26,380
about this thing over and over again.

1826
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:27,860
Boom, I went right back in AFib.

1827
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:29,180
So I had to go back and do it again.

1828
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:32,220
And, uh, then they put me on medication.

1829
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:36,820
So I have to take medication, you know, and anytime you go into AFib, I guess,

1830
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:38,460
they, uh, it puts you on a blood thinner.

1831
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,940
Do you regret having done the hypnotic regression?

1832
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:44,740
Cause it really gave me some insight, you know, and then, and it made it

1833
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:49,500
a lot easier when I, when I, uh, did the session just last year or year

1834
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:54,740
before last with, uh, Yvonne Smith in California, do you ever experience weird

1835
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:59,580
electromagnetic effects with your body or like what sort of stuff, like a light

1836
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:02,980
going off or something when I walk in a room with fluorescent light fluorescent

1837
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:07,780
light, I've got a little, a little light fixture it's named Honda phones dying

1838
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:09,300
quickly, anything like that.

1839
01:52:09,740 --> 01:52:12,500
No, I have had some other strange things go on though.

1840
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:13,940
Uh, Robert Hastings.

1841
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:19,500
I talked about that with emails vanishing everywhere, you know, off the

1842
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,660
cloud and everywhere else just wiped clean.

1843
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:27,220
I've had that happen, uh, as is he, but, um, yeah, I've had several incidents

1844
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:28,780
where that has really bothered me.

1845
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:37,060
Then the night of, uh, December 17th, 2017, uh, my son was in his room.

1846
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:41,220
He was, he was home from, from, uh, working, uh, he was working, he was

1847
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:43,140
in living in Florida, came on the visit.

1848
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:48,780
Uh, and it was right at 4 11 AM.

1849
01:52:48,780 --> 01:52:51,660
And there's, that's also another thing about waking up at certain times

1850
01:52:51,660 --> 01:52:55,180
of the night, one 11, three 33, four 11.

1851
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:59,100
Uh, it's just, it's just strange how that, how that happens.

1852
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:01,140
But, uh, I pay attention to it.

1853
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:07,500
And, uh, I have a room in the back of the house because I, I worked

1854
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:10,020
12 hour shifts, so it rotated.

1855
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:13,220
So sometimes I'd have to, you know, sleep during the day, you know, till

1856
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:18,060
3 PM, get up to go in for a 6 PM to 6 AM shift, you know, so it was rotating.

1857
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:21,020
So I had to have it darkened out so you could sleep.

1858
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:22,580
You just guys can't sleep in sunlight.

1859
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:27,100
I don't know anybody that can, but, uh, anyway, I was, I was there sleeping

1860
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:34,820
and had to get up for work and all of a sudden I opened my eyes and I had

1861
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:36,940
this, I'm standing at the foot of my bed.

1862
01:53:36,940 --> 01:53:41,260
I have, I have never been a person to sleepwalk ever in my life that I know.

1863
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:42,100
I know ever.

1864
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:46,740
And I'm standing at the foot of my bed, holding onto my bed frame with my right

1865
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:50,340
hand and directly in front of me, there's about a four and a half or a five foot

1866
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:54,020
whole diameter in a North wall of my bedroom.

1867
01:53:54,820 --> 01:54:01,020
And on that, in that circle that vanished immediately, like sparks

1868
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:02,780
flew off either side of it.

1869
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:05,180
That's like, what the hell?

1870
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:12,780
Anyway, as soon as that, as soon as that flashed out or went away, all the

1871
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:16,860
lights in my house started flickering just all over the house.

1872
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:21,900
And then the strange alarms started, I started hearing them and my son

1873
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:24,180
popped through my door and he goes, dad, what the hell's going on?

1874
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:25,140
He goes, what's going on?

1875
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:27,340
I said, I don't know, son.

1876
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:29,180
He goes, what's those alarms?

1877
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:29,940
And I said, I don't know.

1878
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:30,980
I grabbed my pistol.

1879
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:33,020
I didn't know why I was going to clear my house, you know?

1880
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:35,420
And, uh, which I did.

1881
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:41,380
I couldn't explain what I just saw and hadn't even verbally said anything about

1882
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:46,180
it yet, and it was just right here in front of me, uh, and mind you, just two

1883
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:52,140
dressers that were partially that had a, that were partially gone or in

1884
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:54,020
that dark circle that I saw.

1885
01:54:55,540 --> 01:55:00,540
And so I cleared my house and the, and I go into the kitchen area and the, all

1886
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:04,540
the lights were just like, just barely on, like they're just like the candle

1887
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:10,860
light all throughout the house and the stove, the oven, the microwave and

1888
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:14,420
refrigerator, they have low voltage alarms on them, which I never knew.

1889
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:16,060
That's what the alarms were.

1890
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:17,140
They were all going off.

1891
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:21,820
So everything seemed to be normal other than the fact that the lights were on.

1892
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:23,780
I tried flipping on lights and they wouldn't come on.

1893
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:26,820
They just come on barely and just flicker for a minute.

1894
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:29,700
And I just turned it back off, you know, but the stuff, but the light over

1895
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:33,460
the stove, it was doing that every light, every electrical component in my

1896
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:35,940
home was affected, everything, doorbell system, everything.

1897
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:39,100
So I went back and talked to my son.

1898
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:42,380
I said, Jake, I said, what the heck was that?

1899
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:43,820
What the heck was that, man?

1900
01:55:43,820 --> 01:55:44,940
He goes, I don't know, dad.

1901
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:45,580
It's weird.

1902
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:46,660
He gets, it's really weird.

1903
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:48,060
You can call them and talk to them about it.

1904
01:55:48,820 --> 01:55:51,900
So I said, well, I'll call Georgia power in the morning when I get up, you know?

1905
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:55,620
So I, I just put everything down.

1906
01:55:55,620 --> 01:56:00,100
I laid back down and just thinking, you know, uh, what was that?

1907
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:05,140
And about eight o'clock, my son pops through my door and go, he knocks first.

1908
01:56:05,140 --> 01:56:07,260
He says, Hey dad, he goes, George powers here.

1909
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:08,540
I said, what?

1910
01:56:09,620 --> 01:56:11,420
He said, yeah, Georgia powers in the front yard.

1911
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:12,740
And I live on an acre.

1912
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:17,740
So to my, to the street from my front porch is about 200 feet.

1913
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:24,020
And, uh, so I got dressed and I hobbled out there and these guys are out there

1914
01:56:24,020 --> 01:56:28,780
working on the, where the power distribution comes into my home and it's all underground.

1915
01:56:28,780 --> 01:56:30,180
My home was built in 97.

1916
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:34,460
And, uh, so I found the supervisor.

1917
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:36,940
I said, I said, Hey, I said, how you doing, sir?

1918
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:38,180
I said, I told him my name.

1919
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:39,020
He goes, is this your house?

1920
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:39,820
And I said, yes, sir.

1921
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:40,780
He just looked at me.

1922
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:44,300
And, uh, I said, wow.

1923
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:45,780
I said, what happened?

1924
01:56:45,780 --> 01:56:50,300
He goes, um, he just looked at me and he said, uh, well, he

1925
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:52,940
lost, he lost power, lost the leg of power.

1926
01:56:53,780 --> 01:56:55,220
I said, dang, does that up?

1927
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:56,780
Does that mess up the whole neighborhood?

1928
01:56:56,780 --> 01:56:57,740
He goes, he looked at me.

1929
01:56:57,740 --> 01:56:59,700
He says, no, he says just your house.

1930
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:01,540
I said, what do you mean?

1931
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:06,460
He goes, well, you lit up our board downtown like the 4th of July out here.

1932
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:09,020
And I said, well, how did I do that?

1933
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:09,860
We were all asleep.

1934
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:10,980
You said, I don't know.

1935
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:14,300
He said, but we're going to have to replace this leg.

1936
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:16,100
So you have power in your home.

1937
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:18,060
He said, come on, I'll show you something.

1938
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:22,420
Say they had already taken this big dolly and it had like transformer equipment.

1939
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:23,380
I've got pictures of it.

1940
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:25,260
Call Robert Hastings.

1941
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:30,940
First thing they take this transformer thing on, on a dolly, take it to

1942
01:57:30,940 --> 01:57:35,660
the back where my meter is and they jumper in to that meter box.

1943
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:40,220
So to establish power or a, uh, what do you call it?

1944
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:47,020
To, um, uh, refine the, the power going in my home instead of, instead of just

1945
01:57:47,020 --> 01:57:48,540
two legs, it gives it a third leg.

1946
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:49,580
Somehow it converts it.

1947
01:57:49,580 --> 01:57:53,020
And I don't know how that works, but I got pictures of it and he said, you'll

1948
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:55,100
be fine till we can come out and replace that wire.

1949
01:57:55,300 --> 01:58:00,740
And, uh, it took them about two days, three days and they were back and they did it.

1950
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:06,420
But, uh, I just kept questioning what I had seen and what had happened and why

1951
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:12,100
that happened and ours was the only house affected a couple of weeks later.

1952
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:15,180
One of our neighbor's kids come by that.

1953
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:18,220
My son used to play with, he stopped his truck.

1954
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:19,380
He's got an F one 50.

1955
01:58:20,020 --> 01:58:20,700
He says, Hey, Mr.

1956
01:58:20,700 --> 01:58:21,060
Woods.

1957
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:22,260
And he's been in my backyard.

1958
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:23,380
These kids have had parties.

1959
01:58:23,380 --> 01:58:26,020
They all shot bows and arrows together, BB guns, name it.

1960
01:58:26,020 --> 01:58:29,060
You know, we do all that stuff, ride motorcycles.

1961
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:30,740
He goes, Hey, Mr.

1962
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:33,740
Woods, he said, um, I was cutting my grass and he waved at me and I'll

1963
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:35,700
stop and I stopped and he stopped.

1964
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:38,900
And he goes, Hey, what was going on there?

1965
01:58:38,980 --> 01:58:42,300
Uh, last week or so when all those lights were in your backyard.

1966
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:43,660
And I said, what are you talking about?

1967
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:46,260
He just, he didn't hesitate it for a second.

1968
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:51,380
He goes, he goes, your backyard was lit up like a Hollywood set or something.

1969
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:53,580
He said, like those great big lights, they say up in the air.

1970
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:55,500
He says a whole backyard was lit up.

1971
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:57,860
I said, what do you mean, man?

1972
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:00,620
He said, yeah, it was four o'clock in the morning.

1973
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:01,700
He was leaving for work.

1974
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:02,860
That's how he saw that.

1975
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:06,500
And I said, well, you know, I've only got two spotlights right there

1976
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:08,620
on the corner of that room outside.

1977
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:13,100
And I said, uh, and on the corner of the back and the lights over the, on

1978
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:16,780
the rear patio, you know, he goes, I don't know, but it was lit up

1979
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:17,860
like you wouldn't believe.

1980
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:19,940
And I just, I just kept it to myself.

1981
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:22,500
I said, man, what did happen?

1982
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:23,900
Really?

1983
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:31,340
So what would they, what interests could they possibly, they would have in,

1984
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:36,500
you know, in a 65 year old man or whatever age I was at that time,

1985
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:39,340
what, what could they possibly want?

1986
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:40,580
I mean, what do you think?

1987
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:41,660
I have no idea.

1988
01:59:41,780 --> 01:59:43,500
I honestly don't have a clue.

1989
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:44,140
What do you think?

1990
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:46,740
What do you hope the world gets from your testimony?

1991
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:53,660
Understanding perhaps or possibility of, uh,

1992
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:58,340
perhaps not to fear as much.

1993
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:05,900
And, uh, not to think that they're here to defeat us because they were, we

1994
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:07,820
wouldn't be having this conversation right now.

1995
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:10,620
They'd have done it long ago.

1996
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:13,900
Anyhow, do you think they're hybridizing themselves with us?

1997
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:20,140
Could very well be depends upon their, maybe their situation on their own planet.

1998
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:24,540
Maybe they're overcrowded perhaps, or they're something's dying there or

1999
02:00:25,780 --> 02:00:27,060
progression through space.

2000
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:30,060
You know, you can't always get back to the starting point.

2001
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:34,860
You know, maybe they have to occupy worlds along the way in their great expansion.

2002
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:39,300
Well, it sounds like even on Ellsworth that it was kind of an open secret that,

2003
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:43,700
you know, a lot of people had had some interesting experiences before you, Mario.

2004
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:48,060
Do you think, you know, I was talking with Robert Hastings and you know, he was

2005
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:53,500
noting that he had 167 ICPM security personnel, radar operators, guys on, on

2006
02:00:53,740 --> 02:00:56,580
bases like yourself who've experienced crafts.

2007
02:00:56,980 --> 02:01:00,380
And then I remember I asked him, I was like, you know, Robert, uh, what

2008
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:03,260
percentage of these people have had close encounters of the third kind where

2009
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:04,620
they've actually met beings?

2010
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:08,340
And he said something like seven or eight, but then he said, I didn't ask

2011
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:10,300
anybody, those were the people that volunteered.

2012
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:15,060
And I think about the culture of secrecy and humility, uh, when it comes to

2013
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:19,580
working at nuclear bases, if you have seven or eight people who you're just

2014
02:01:19,580 --> 02:01:23,860
incidentally finding out are having, you know, close encounters with the third

2015
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:29,060
kind and actually seeing beings, it's probably over a hundred of the 170.

2016
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:31,740
It's probably a, you know, a massive, uh, you know,

2017
02:01:31,940 --> 02:01:33,980
never alone, always with a partner.

2018
02:01:34,380 --> 02:01:37,620
You were never alone in any nuclear facility.

2019
02:01:37,620 --> 02:01:39,820
It's a two man rule.

2020
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:41,820
It has to be two of you at all times.

2021
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:45,140
Are there other cases like yours that you've found out about where the

2022
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:47,780
partner sort of seems to disappear or go missing?

2023
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:51,060
Terry Lovelace and his partner, Toby.

2024
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:53,180
Cause Terry's still around, right?

2025
02:01:53,220 --> 02:01:53,500
Oh yeah.

2026
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:53,740
Yeah.

2027
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:54,580
He's a great guy.

2028
02:01:54,620 --> 02:01:55,580
But Toby's gone.

2029
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:56,220
Toby's gone.

2030
02:01:56,220 --> 02:01:59,580
He, uh, Terry told me that he, he literally, he never fully

2031
02:01:59,580 --> 02:02:01,740
recovered after their incident.

2032
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:02,820
Now he was not on duty.

2033
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:04,300
They were simply on a camping trip.

2034
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:08,900
And is Toby like in some facility, mental health facility, or is he just

2035
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:11,060
like, no, no trace of him.

2036
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:12,220
Terry can't even find him.

2037
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:13,940
No, no, no, he was available.

2038
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:18,660
And, uh, of course the VA, uh, they were giving him, you know, whatever

2039
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:21,340
pills or whatever to help his anxiety.

2040
02:02:21,820 --> 02:02:27,420
And, um, from my understanding, he had a really bad drinking problem

2041
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:28,620
from that period of time.

2042
02:02:29,580 --> 02:02:37,180
And, uh, some people, I guess that's the way it affects and it's really quite sad.

2043
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:39,860
Uh, and he was a real light-skinned black guy also.

2044
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:42,740
And we talk about that correlation between us and our partners.

2045
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:44,100
And it happened the same year.

2046
02:02:44,620 --> 02:02:47,420
Also in that movie, close encounters, a third kind came out.

2047
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:52,660
I, I went to see it in rapid city at the theater, you know, on

2048
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:54,100
main streets, still there today.

2049
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:58,180
Uh, or the building is, I'm not sure if the theater is or not, but I think it is.

2050
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:05,500
And, uh, that part where, uh, Roy Neary is crossing the railroad tracks and,

2051
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:09,300
and he's looking at the map, got the flashlight in his mouth and that light

2052
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:14,820
pops on, if you'll notice during that period of time, his body was, it was

2053
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:21,740
as if he was being, um, whatever he was hearing or feeling was talking to him

2054
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:23,620
or programming him on the inside.

2055
02:03:23,620 --> 02:03:31,900
He's a literally, he's doing some kind of a weird, uh, uh, I should say

2056
02:03:32,020 --> 02:03:35,660
receiving of whatever is, is giving him.

2057
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:39,100
And you can see it and he portrays it very well.

2058
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:42,700
And it really made me think a lot, because when I saw that movie is as if

2059
02:03:42,700 --> 02:03:46,460
what's going on in a missile field right now, not just to me, but to these

2060
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:49,220
craft are out there, there's cattle mutilations going on, Linda

2061
02:03:49,220 --> 02:03:50,540
Moulton house in the area.

2062
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:56,940
I tried contacting her like 20 might've been before that, but she got my email

2063
02:03:56,940 --> 02:04:02,700
into our 2014, I had sent something to her and, uh, she worked at a station

2064
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:06,820
in Denver, Colorado was, you know, like, I don't know if she was in what kind

2065
02:04:06,820 --> 02:04:10,580
of news she did, but she was investigating cattle mutilations all

2066
02:04:10,580 --> 02:04:12,300
throughout the Northwest where we were.

2067
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:16,860
And, uh, of course we were told not to speak to any media people whatsoever.

2068
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:24,060
But the point is that, um, when he underwent what he did under that light

2069
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:29,460
before that craft let him go, it seemed to put something in his mind, which

2070
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:34,020
really struck me before it stopped, you know, and moved, I had to literally

2071
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:39,820
get up out of my seat and I ran out and sat on the curb on main street in

2072
02:04:39,820 --> 02:04:45,380
rapid city, cause I, I, what I just saw felt as if it was a direct replay of

2073
02:04:45,380 --> 02:04:50,100
what I just went through only a little bit different where, you know, the

2074
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:54,020
crap was above him and these little guys came up to the side of our vehicle.

2075
02:04:54,940 --> 02:04:56,460
Just that, just like that.

2076
02:04:57,380 --> 02:05:03,300
And it's really hard to deal with, you know, often it feels like, um, the

2077
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:07,940
ear bones are messed with the bones dealing with balance and orientation.

2078
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:11,780
And then this is a interesting kind of connection around them.

2079
02:05:11,780 --> 02:05:12,820
Checking your teeth.

2080
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:17,660
My buddy made a documentary on this guy, Andre Puharich and Puharich

2081
02:05:17,940 --> 02:05:19,900
helped start the MK ultra program.

2082
02:05:19,900 --> 02:05:21,940
So it's like CIA, Yugoslavian guy.

2083
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:22,860
What is he?

2084
02:05:22,900 --> 02:05:26,620
Is he, I think he was read something about the guy with that name.

2085
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:27,580
I'm pretty sure I did.

2086
02:05:27,860 --> 02:05:28,220
Yeah.

2087
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:31,860
He's either he's like, yeah, Eastern European or Russian.

2088
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:32,260
Yeah.

2089
02:05:32,260 --> 02:05:33,500
Maybe, maybe Yugoslavian.

2090
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:37,740
And, um, yeah, he was at Northwestern and he had, you know, the Roundtable

2091
02:05:37,740 --> 02:05:40,740
Institute at Maine where they were sort of summoning stuff.

2092
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:45,940
And then he was also, he had this actually school of space children in

2093
02:05:45,940 --> 02:05:49,940
upstate New York where he was, you know, studying all sorts of telepathy

2094
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:51,060
and download channeling.

2095
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:55,140
Actually, the book Star Trek came, he had this one, uh, channeler

2096
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:56,700
named Phyllis, Phyllis Schaeffer.

2097
02:05:57,140 --> 02:06:00,860
And, uh, she wrote a book called the only planet of choice that was

2098
02:06:00,860 --> 02:06:04,500
channeled and she was in communication with the nine quote unquote, which

2099
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:08,300
is this council of, you know, possible ET beings and they were talking about

2100
02:06:08,300 --> 02:06:10,220
the earth as a bottleneck of consciousness.

2101
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:14,380
We have to get past this bottleneck in order to ascend whatever fascinating

2102
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:21,300
stuff, but, um, interestingly, Puharich found this guy who was sort of

2103
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:25,220
schizophrenic and he was hearing voices in his head, but it almost sounded like

2104
02:06:25,220 --> 02:06:29,020
the voices he was hearing were similar to like what somebody would describe in

2105
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:33,060
an alien telepathy experience where they were, they were getting, he was getting

2106
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:38,020
kind of immediate downloads and Puharich was studying him and they realized he

2107
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:41,300
was a construction worker and he was working with, uh, you know, sawing

2108
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:42,300
metals or whatever.

2109
02:06:42,700 --> 02:06:48,700
And so they found these fine, uh, you know, metals in his teeth and that

2110
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:55,420
somehow in Puharich belief was that, um, extremely low frequency radio waves

2111
02:06:55,500 --> 02:07:00,620
were actually responsible for thought in a way that's upstream or connected with

2112
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:03,940
the acoustical waves that, you know, represent our normal cognition.

2113
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:09,500
And so maybe they were checking your teeth either because they were worried

2114
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:13,780
that you were already receiving downloads or like in touch prior to this

2115
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:17,980
experience, or because they thought the implant where they would communicate

2116
02:07:18,060 --> 02:07:20,300
with you on a go-forward basis might be there.

2117
02:07:21,620 --> 02:07:22,140
Wow.

2118
02:07:22,780 --> 02:07:24,340
I've never even thought of it that way.

2119
02:07:24,340 --> 02:07:29,740
I, some people said they were looking at you maybe for radioactive contamination

2120
02:07:29,740 --> 02:07:30,540
or something like that.

2121
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:31,940
You might be right.

2122
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:33,420
I mean, this is my, my hair.

2123
02:07:33,620 --> 02:07:34,980
That really does make sense, man.

2124
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:36,220
I mean, you got to look at it all.

2125
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:38,060
You can't, you can't discount anything.

2126
02:07:38,580 --> 02:07:42,940
Cause you're dealing with a technology that, that don't sit on couches, you

2127
02:07:42,940 --> 02:07:50,060
know, that, that can speak full volumes through your cellular work in your body.

2128
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:51,980
They don't need to communicate.

2129
02:07:51,980 --> 02:07:55,740
I mean, they have no, that's something that's their brain is so far past that

2130
02:07:56,420 --> 02:07:58,740
they don't have to speak words to you.

2131
02:07:58,740 --> 02:08:05,580
And their language is, is probably where we say, and, um, um, man, like

2132
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:06,980
there's none of that in that.

2133
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:07,500
Yeah.

2134
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:08,700
They have those conversations.

2135
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:10,380
It's direct route access.

2136
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:14,700
And you never ever will forget that feeling and that sound ever.

2137
02:08:14,940 --> 02:08:15,140
Yeah.

2138
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:20,380
It's almost like we have this meme library that was, is installed or something.

2139
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:23,700
You look at like Descartes demon, like maybe that's actually more true than

2140
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:30,580
not where, uh, the Cartesian 3d time bound plane is sort of controlled, uh,

2141
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:35,740
at least as far as the veneer that we see and, uh, the shade, the shades of that

2142
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:40,060
we're seeing shadow of play of something higher and, uh, that something higher

2143
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:44,980
might communicate, be able to communicate on a much more direct level and also be

2144
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:50,860
able to, um, shade or, uh, you know, in Plato, you have like, you know, it's

2145
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:52,660
like, don't trust your senses, right?

2146
02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:53,100
Right.

2147
02:08:53,180 --> 02:08:56,620
You have to contemplate virtue and you can ascend out of the lower world or

2148
02:08:56,620 --> 02:08:59,060
whatever, there's much more and, uh,

2149
02:08:59,260 --> 02:09:00,780
I only want to read any of that.

2150
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:03,060
Yeah.

2151
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:07,580
And, um, and you forget your primordial self and maybe in experiences like this,

2152
02:09:07,580 --> 02:09:10,820
you sort of, you know, you get back in touch with it, but maybe, maybe some of

2153
02:09:10,820 --> 02:09:15,140
these beings are, yeah, you know, I was at, I helped put offs house not too

2154
02:09:15,140 --> 02:09:19,300
long ago and on his bookshelf, he had this book called daemonic reality.

2155
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:22,820
And it was like, you know, like, I don't know, I got to read the book,

2156
02:09:22,820 --> 02:09:27,220
but it's, it feels like the implication is like our low level reality is kind

2157
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:29,540
of controlled by some sort of, you know, Gnostic traditions.

2158
02:09:29,540 --> 02:09:34,540
You might call it like a Demiurge where, um, we're not seeing, you know,

2159
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:35,540
ultimate reality.

2160
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:41,380
I think in Lou's book, I found the part where he talks about some of his

2161
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:48,500
superiors, where they have this demonic, uh, direction thinking these things were.

2162
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:49,820
Yeah.

2163
02:09:49,820 --> 02:09:50,060
Yeah.

2164
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:51,820
It's called the Collins elite.

2165
02:09:52,020 --> 02:09:52,420
Yeah.

2166
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:52,980
Yes.

2167
02:09:53,540 --> 02:09:58,380
You know, versus where Lou was in his thinking, which I agree with a hundred

2168
02:09:58,380 --> 02:10:02,060
percent, I've been told that several times, well, you know, these are just

2169
02:10:02,060 --> 02:10:05,820
demons, these are just angels and demons, you know, all right, well, what's

2170
02:10:05,820 --> 02:10:08,460
your definition definition of an angel?

2171
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:13,180
That's what, yeah, in my book, I mean, I would just look at somebody that says

2172
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:17,660
that, you know, I'm not saying it doesn't exist, you know, I, I, I'm serious.

2173
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:22,060
And I've, I've seen something in my time too, after our mother passed away

2174
02:10:22,540 --> 02:10:28,100
and that really, uh, an apparition, I'll just say, and it was my mother's

2175
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:31,340
apparition and my brothers both saw it.

2176
02:10:32,220 --> 02:10:37,620
And, uh, uh, and that established me, you know, that night I said, and

2177
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:38,620
we all talked about it.

2178
02:10:39,220 --> 02:10:42,300
Our mama was standing in that kitchen in a lightning storm.

2179
02:10:42,980 --> 02:10:46,980
Her figure was there, not her face, but her figure was there.

2180
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:51,220
And at two o'clock in the morning on a thunderstorm night in Tampa, Florida,

2181
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:52,380
a couple of days after she died.

2182
02:10:52,380 --> 02:10:53,100
And that's the truth.

2183
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:57,740
But I, I, I totally agree with what you, what you're just saying there.

2184
02:10:58,460 --> 02:11:03,300
Cause I think that, uh, I always associate it to when you're in your mother's

2185
02:11:03,300 --> 02:11:08,100
womb and you're, and your dad or your mom, or you're one of your aunt's been

2186
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:12,420
down or your brother's future brother or sister leans down and starts talking

2187
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:18,140
to you and you're in your mother's womb, you know, baby hears that that to me.

2188
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:25,780
Uh, directly related to what I kept hearing, do not fear that I recognized

2189
02:11:25,780 --> 02:11:35,580
it and, uh, the accent on that voice sounded as if, uh, something off of, uh,

2190
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:39,820
what was that, um, Hogwarts or what, or what, what do you call it?

2191
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:45,500
Um, yeah, Harry Potter, when that snake is talking to him, like that,

2192
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:47,380
that's the way those basilisk.

2193
02:11:47,860 --> 02:11:49,860
That's the way those words rolled.

2194
02:11:50,660 --> 02:11:52,500
Do you like, I can't even do it.

2195
02:11:52,660 --> 02:11:56,780
Do not fear, do not fear and elongate it out.

2196
02:11:56,780 --> 02:12:01,420
Not just those words, uh, how short I was, do not fear it.

2197
02:12:01,420 --> 02:12:08,420
I still can't do it right, but it, it, it gets to every part of you in description.

2198
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:09,340
It gets to every part.

2199
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:11,220
You just feel it radiate through you.

2200
02:12:11,740 --> 02:12:14,860
And before joining Ellsworth Air Force Base, what was, what was

2201
02:12:14,860 --> 02:12:15,780
kind of your motivation?

2202
02:12:15,780 --> 02:12:16,900
Why'd you get into this?

2203
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:20,700
Uh, honestly, uh, I should have probably gone in the Navy.

2204
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:25,300
Uh, my father was a merchant seaman and he sailed with Texaco, sailed all of

2205
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:32,940
his life, seen USOs, um, he was in a car accident in 73 and lost his life.

2206
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:38,300
And I just turned 17 years old, uh, when that happened.

2207
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:41,900
So it literally changed the entire configuration of my family.

2208
02:12:42,540 --> 02:12:46,540
And my thoughts prior to, I wanted to go to the, uh, maritime Institute.

2209
02:12:46,540 --> 02:12:48,540
I think it was in some part of Connecticut.

2210
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:49,740
I could be mistaken.

2211
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:52,180
Uh, and I wanted to become a captain.

2212
02:12:52,740 --> 02:12:55,980
I didn't want to be a chief engineer because I saw how dirty my dad would get.

2213
02:12:55,980 --> 02:13:00,420
Or I'd go down to an engine room of a ship that he was on at port and see him

2214
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:03,700
climbing up out, out of a cylinder of a, of an engine.

2215
02:13:03,780 --> 02:13:08,140
So, you know, the size of these things are massive and, uh, I always

2216
02:13:08,140 --> 02:13:09,340
respected that a great deal.

2217
02:13:09,340 --> 02:13:14,220
But for me, uh, growing up in South Florida and, and Long Beach and other

2218
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:18,180
places, I, uh, always had this aspiration for things that flew.

2219
02:13:18,620 --> 02:13:21,700
So whenever the Cape was launching and that kind of thing, I always went

2220
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:24,420
outside either to see him or go with a bunch of friends, go to Cape

2221
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:26,740
Pinaveral to, you know, to watch a rocket launch.

2222
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:29,060
And originally I didn't want to go.

2223
02:13:29,060 --> 02:13:30,820
I wouldn't even think about security police.

2224
02:13:30,860 --> 02:13:34,980
Uh, but, uh, I'm colorblind.

2225
02:13:35,180 --> 02:13:38,740
And after I passed all the tests to work on rocket engines, cause I

2226
02:13:38,740 --> 02:13:40,580
thought NASA is my goal, right?

2227
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:45,300
I, uh, was in the hallway at the aphid station in Jacksonville, just a young

2228
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:51,100
guy, long hair down here and, uh, this little staff sergeant, she came running

2229
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:52,460
up to me, she goes, uh, Mr.

2230
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:54,580
Woods, she goes, we got to, we got to talk to you for a minute.

2231
02:13:54,580 --> 02:13:55,860
And I said, what is it?

2232
02:13:55,860 --> 02:13:56,980
You know, I was ready to go.

2233
02:13:56,980 --> 02:13:58,340
I was going to go back home to Tampa.

2234
02:13:59,060 --> 02:14:04,340
Uh, and she told me, she goes, uh, I need you to talk to somebody.

2235
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:05,060
And I said, okay.

2236
02:14:05,060 --> 02:14:09,380
So I went back with her when in this office and there was this gentleman

2237
02:14:09,380 --> 02:14:12,660
standing there and I think he was like a tech sergeant, he six, he seven,

2238
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:14,340
somewhere around there and he goes, uh, Mr.

2239
02:14:14,340 --> 02:14:15,940
Woods, he goes, I need you to look at some things.

2240
02:14:15,940 --> 02:14:18,620
And he opens up this sample book.

2241
02:14:18,620 --> 02:14:20,820
Like you would go pick out carpet, you know, with all these

2242
02:14:20,820 --> 02:14:22,860
different colors of carpet, but it was wiring.

2243
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:29,180
And he said, show me the, the, uh, purple and yellow, uh, intertwined wire.

2244
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:32,500
And I just looked, you know, and really I couldn't do it.

2245
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:36,980
And, uh, he let me do that two or three times and he goes, that's why

2246
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:38,980
you can't wire a rocket engine.

2247
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:41,540
So it made perfect sense to me.

2248
02:14:41,540 --> 02:14:45,020
So of course I did score good on my ASPAP test.

2249
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:48,140
So she asked me if I'd be interested in some other things.

2250
02:14:48,140 --> 02:14:49,620
And I said, sure, let's have a look.

2251
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:51,220
So they had videotapes back then.

2252
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:56,060
And, um, I looked at a couple of them and then I saw these guys

2253
02:14:56,060 --> 02:14:59,460
rappelling out of a helicopter, you know, fully clothed, fully armed,

2254
02:14:59,460 --> 02:15:01,180
you know, and it came out on fast ropes.

2255
02:15:01,180 --> 02:15:03,860
And I said, and they had berets on their head and I said,

2256
02:15:03,860 --> 02:15:04,740
that's what I want to do.

2257
02:15:04,740 --> 02:15:08,300
So that's how I ended up in security police and loved it.

2258
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:10,020
So you want to be a rocket scientist?

2259
02:15:10,340 --> 02:15:13,140
Well, I wanted to do engines, rocket engines.

2260
02:15:13,140 --> 02:15:13,380
Yes.

2261
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:15,340
I have a tough job.

2262
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:17,540
I used to always launch rockets growing up as a kid.

2263
02:15:17,540 --> 02:15:17,980
Did you?

2264
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:18,420
Yeah.

2265
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:22,180
They were 98 cents for, you know, the little rocket engines, you know,

2266
02:15:22,180 --> 02:15:27,820
fuselages were all made of like, uh, paper towel rolls or something.

2267
02:15:27,860 --> 02:15:30,940
What do you think sparked your early interest in rockets and space?

2268
02:15:31,900 --> 02:15:37,580
Uh, I I'm sure that what I saw in 1961 at D Queen elementary

2269
02:15:38,060 --> 02:15:40,500
school in Port Arthur, Texas had something to do with it.

2270
02:15:40,540 --> 02:15:42,620
Uh, where'd you see in 1961?

2271
02:15:42,660 --> 02:15:49,860
Uh, my, my mother, uh, was taking me to my first grade, uh, school,

2272
02:15:49,900 --> 02:15:51,300
which was D Queen elementary.

2273
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:56,020
And, uh, we were about the fifth or the seventh car back in line.

2274
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:59,300
And I'm on the passenger side in the, in the front seat, no seatbelt.

2275
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:00,460
We didn't do that back then.

2276
02:16:00,980 --> 02:16:02,420
My sister was in the back seat.

2277
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:05,620
Of course, my mother's driving and she stopped short of the car in front of her.

2278
02:16:06,580 --> 02:16:09,180
And she says, look, Anthony, look at those flying saucers.

2279
02:16:10,380 --> 02:16:12,940
When's the last time your mother ever said something like that to you?

2280
02:16:13,580 --> 02:16:16,940
I mean, I'm just six years old, five and a half, six years old.

2281
02:16:17,940 --> 02:16:20,700
And I, I just couldn't even fathom what she said.

2282
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:25,780
And they were right over a church, just maybe 25 to 50 feet in the air.

2283
02:16:25,780 --> 02:16:26,500
And there were three of them.

2284
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:29,620
They were beautiful, prettiest craft ever seen in my life.

2285
02:16:29,660 --> 02:16:31,300
I can picture them in my mind right now.

2286
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:33,060
My sister and I talk about it all the time.

2287
02:16:34,060 --> 02:16:38,740
And, uh, the thing that struck me was they were there long enough to where I kind of

2288
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:44,100
did a really strange scan, looking around at people always kind of anything worth

2289
02:16:44,100 --> 02:16:48,420
memorizes and memorizing is worth looking around for a moment to take a quick mental

2290
02:16:48,420 --> 02:16:50,500
picture of it, if that explains that.

2291
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:55,540
But we had a playground directly across from the school that the road was blocked

2292
02:16:55,540 --> 02:17:02,180
off and all the kids, everybody met out there before class time, every eye and arm

2293
02:17:02,180 --> 02:17:07,140
and hand and pointer finger was pointing in the air and then looking back to the

2294
02:17:07,140 --> 02:17:10,700
left at the side of the school, we didn't have AC back then.

2295
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:12,340
So the windows were always open.

2296
02:17:12,340 --> 02:17:16,300
There were people, it was like a four, maybe five story building at the time.

2297
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:17,700
It's been since rebuilt.

2298
02:17:17,780 --> 02:17:23,380
Uh, um, but anyway, all these people were pointing out the windows and the

2299
02:17:23,380 --> 02:17:25,900
grades went from kindergarten to 12th grade there.

2300
02:17:26,420 --> 02:17:31,540
So everybody, including teachers were looking outside and the strangest part

2301
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:36,900
about it, it was over the directly over this church that sat right on the corner

2302
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:41,900
of Dequeen Boulevard and the schools here and the church was there.

2303
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:45,540
So they were just right here and we were right there next to it.

2304
02:17:45,540 --> 02:17:48,580
And my mom, she opens her door and steps out.

2305
02:17:48,580 --> 02:17:50,860
And my sister, I remember her saying, mom, I'm scared.

2306
02:17:50,860 --> 02:17:52,300
She says, it'll be okay, honey.

2307
02:17:52,340 --> 02:17:53,340
They're not here to hurt you.

2308
02:17:54,260 --> 02:17:55,100
That's what she said.

2309
02:17:55,660 --> 02:17:58,340
And I grabbed her by the other hand, we were hanging there watching them, you

2310
02:17:58,340 --> 02:18:00,940
know, and probably watched them for a good couple of minutes.

2311
02:18:01,340 --> 02:18:08,220
And they were white silver craft, standard saucer configuration with a dome on top

2312
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:12,780
and a dome on the bottom, but they had these lights that went around the outer rim of it.

2313
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:18,060
And they were all in, they were all synchronized and it was extremely fast.

2314
02:18:18,060 --> 02:18:23,100
It was so much to take in as something you've never seen or didn't, it couldn't

2315
02:18:23,100 --> 02:18:26,700
even know existed, but it felt so normal.

2316
02:18:26,740 --> 02:18:29,740
It looked so normal, like somebody was checking in on us.

2317
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:37,140
If that's the word and when they left, it was all at one time straight up, if

2318
02:18:37,140 --> 02:18:39,660
there would have been clouds, they'd have punched holes through those clouds.

2319
02:18:40,140 --> 02:18:41,380
And they were just gone.

2320
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:46,060
It just literally just went from that big around to this big around and out of your

2321
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:46,580
sight.

2322
02:18:47,340 --> 02:18:53,820
And the strangest part about that, everybody on that playground in the school, in

2323
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:56,020
school, nobody said a word about it.

2324
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:59,380
Everybody went right back to what they were doing and never mentioned it.

2325
02:18:59,380 --> 02:19:04,340
All day long, have you talked to any of the witnesses since other than my sister, my

2326
02:19:04,340 --> 02:19:10,220
mother has since passed long ago, but, uh, uh, Port Arthur, Texas is a long time, a

2327
02:19:10,220 --> 02:19:14,940
long time ago, but, uh, I've never forgotten that.

2328
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:18,740
So it's really, really something that's remarkable.

2329
02:19:18,740 --> 02:19:20,500
Did you feel changed after that at all?

2330
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:25,220
Or in some way, my sister and I talked about it.

2331
02:19:25,220 --> 02:19:28,780
I just think the visualization of it and what it could possibly mean to a six year

2332
02:19:29,260 --> 02:19:35,260
old definitely has, and, you know, changing effects on what you've known forever.

2333
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:40,820
You know, not questioning God because I believe in God and, uh, and, and, and my

2334
02:19:40,820 --> 02:19:44,220
savior, but I, I, it just changes you.

2335
02:19:44,220 --> 02:19:49,580
It, it, uh, opens your eyes or your mind into what is, or could be.

2336
02:19:50,620 --> 02:19:54,300
And that might've gotten you interested in space and rock, possibly that sort of

2337
02:19:54,300 --> 02:19:54,700
thing.

2338
02:19:54,700 --> 02:19:55,020
Yeah.

2339
02:19:55,380 --> 02:19:56,020
Interesting.

2340
02:19:56,100 --> 02:19:58,580
I don't think that, I don't think they come without a reason.

2341
02:19:58,580 --> 02:20:04,220
I, I, if I can just say that, I think, I think they have great effects and there's

2342
02:20:04,260 --> 02:20:09,100
seems to be this thing with the number three, what it could mean.

2343
02:20:09,100 --> 02:20:09,660
I don't know.

2344
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:13,620
I know, I know Tesla had a real strange thing concerning the number three and

2345
02:20:13,620 --> 02:20:14,700
I've read a lot about him.

2346
02:20:15,580 --> 02:20:16,060
Um,

2347
02:20:17,260 --> 02:20:19,900
well, it's, yeah, it's a sort of Jesus died at 33.

2348
02:20:20,180 --> 02:20:24,740
Alexander the great died at 33 in Freemasonry of 33 levels.

2349
02:20:24,820 --> 02:20:26,540
Why do you think, why do you think that?

2350
02:20:26,940 --> 02:20:30,860
It's, it's such a, it's such a, like, like a life-changing event that seems

2351
02:20:30,860 --> 02:20:35,300
pretty, pretty bizarre that people won't, especially in 61, when you haven't

2352
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:36,700
seen that many things in the sky.

2353
02:20:36,740 --> 02:20:39,780
No, ever other than aircraft with propellers.

2354
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:44,020
There were no jets, you know, I flew on a bunch of them.

2355
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:46,980
So even at a young age, but yeah, that's very true.

2356
02:20:46,980 --> 02:20:54,300
I, I, I always, I always wonder if just being in the proximity of these things,

2357
02:20:54,300 --> 02:21:01,420
if they're, if they're pulsing or emanating some type of, uh, some type of,

2358
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:07,940
uh, uh, not energy, but a wave or, uh, something that might be inducing to

2359
02:21:07,940 --> 02:21:15,260
humankind, uh, maybe in the thought of them or, or, or some, some kind of idea.

2360
02:21:15,980 --> 02:21:21,540
Uh, you, I don't ever, uh, very few people that I've spoken with or call me

2361
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:28,500
have ever run from a craft or if they've seen one, uh, up close and personal, but

2362
02:21:29,620 --> 02:21:36,660
it just amazes me that it just seems to be the normal thing when a person does

2363
02:21:36,660 --> 02:21:40,140
see it and then they later recollect and, oh, it's something different now, you know.

2364
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:44,220
I don't know if your mom was so nonchalant about it, like that feels so

2365
02:21:44,220 --> 02:21:46,820
shocking, especially when you have your two, two young kids with you.

2366
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:49,380
Uh, she had seen things before she said.

2367
02:21:49,900 --> 02:21:53,860
And, uh, and she literally didn't elaborate on any of it, but she said she had seen

2368
02:21:53,860 --> 02:21:58,020
things before in a Rocky mountain, North Carolina, growing up as a, as a kid.

2369
02:21:58,540 --> 02:22:03,540
And of course my father was from Benaca Honduras and he's seen so many things I

2370
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:09,460
can't even in the, in the jungles and in the ocean, and he used to always tell me

2371
02:22:09,460 --> 02:22:16,100
of, of, you know, an entire crew of 29 or 30 men seeing something exit from the

2372
02:22:16,100 --> 02:22:21,620
water and come up into the atmosphere and bolt off, you know, and I just let it go.

2373
02:22:21,620 --> 02:22:24,700
I never really thought too much about it at all.

2374
02:22:24,780 --> 02:22:27,220
And, uh, if you, I don't know if you've ever heard of the Marine

2375
02:22:27,220 --> 02:22:29,700
Sulphur Queen, it was a ship that sank in 63.

2376
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:33,500
Was she, uh, she left port in Port Arthur, Texas.

2377
02:22:33,500 --> 02:22:36,740
That was the first ship I ever went on as a child at five years old.

2378
02:22:36,740 --> 02:22:39,500
My father served on that vessel and had two cousins on board.

2379
02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:43,980
And, um, he had a job with Texaco at that particular time.

2380
02:22:43,980 --> 02:22:47,940
So I went with him to, he was getting his things and going up that gangway.

2381
02:22:47,940 --> 02:22:50,700
I lost, you know, they didn't net the gangways back then.

2382
02:22:51,300 --> 02:22:55,140
And I lost one of my shoes and I was so fearful of, I have my dad by the

2383
02:22:55,140 --> 02:23:00,060
hand, probably broke his fingers, but, uh, I was so fearful of falling through

2384
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:03,340
the steps and into the water, you know, cause it was at nighttime and then she

2385
02:23:03,340 --> 02:23:07,540
sailed and she was gone just a couple of days later and they never found anything.

2386
02:23:07,540 --> 02:23:13,620
But one nameplate on her said Marine Sulphur on Miami beach and, uh, don't

2387
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:16,180
know what happened to that vessel and all hands were lost.

2388
02:23:16,580 --> 02:23:18,540
So two of his cousins went down on that ship.

2389
02:23:23,460 --> 02:23:26,660
Since I did the documentary last year and wrote my book, I've been

2390
02:23:26,660 --> 02:23:31,940
amazed by the number of people who've told me that the phenomenon of sighting

2391
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:35,260
these objects and having these weird experiences that I suppose you could

2392
02:23:35,260 --> 02:23:37,980
call them paranormal, it runs in the family.

2393
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:40,500
Mom had it, dad had it, granddad had it.

2394
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:42,180
It's quite common, isn't it?

2395
02:23:42,260 --> 02:23:42,580
Yeah.

2396
02:23:42,580 --> 02:23:47,380
I mean, and so I would, I wouldn't turn it into a movie script of some

2397
02:23:47,380 --> 02:23:48,700
sort of magical ability.

2398
02:23:49,140 --> 02:23:55,180
It's just, if it's a feature of intelligence, uh, then, uh, no surprise

2399
02:23:55,180 --> 02:23:57,020
that it gets passed down family to family.

2400
02:23:59,220 --> 02:24:01,100
Mara, you have an amazing story, man.

2401
02:24:01,220 --> 02:24:02,900
I'm super grateful for you.

2402
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:08,140
And I try to, to bring every single part of it out every single time.

2403
02:24:08,180 --> 02:24:12,620
And I just want to be as factual as I know how to be, whether it be the

2404
02:24:12,620 --> 02:24:17,940
incident itself, hypnosis, what I saw, what I drew, what I feel.

2405
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:21,740
And I don't try to embellish any part of this, any part whatsoever.

2406
02:24:21,740 --> 02:24:22,780
I never will do that.

2407
02:24:23,220 --> 02:24:24,580
I just need Michael Johnson.

2408
02:24:24,860 --> 02:24:25,180
Yeah.

2409
02:24:25,180 --> 02:24:26,340
I need Michael Johnson.

2410
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:26,540
Yeah.

2411
02:24:26,860 --> 02:24:28,460
Anybody out there, we got to, yeah.

2412
02:24:29,340 --> 02:24:33,340
Every single, and there's quite a few now podcasts and every single

2413
02:24:33,340 --> 02:24:34,540
network I've ever been on.

2414
02:24:34,980 --> 02:24:39,540
I've always asked if anyone knows Michael Johnson, I don't know his middle initial.

2415
02:24:40,060 --> 02:24:41,860
Uh, he told me he was from Chicago, Illinois.

2416
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:46,900
I went on, I've been on all, you know, on every social media that I could.

2417
02:24:46,980 --> 02:24:51,300
And also TWS, which is together or together, we serve military stuff,

2418
02:24:52,220 --> 02:24:54,140
trying to find people from that time.

2419
02:24:54,140 --> 02:24:58,580
And a couple that I have found that I knew that I've known, um, I

2420
02:24:58,580 --> 02:24:59,700
can't get an answer out of them.

2421
02:24:59,740 --> 02:25:00,020
Yeah.

2422
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:04,420
And I can see their picture and their rank and how, how long they stayed in

2423
02:25:04,420 --> 02:25:08,460
the service, it gives you those dates, but I can't find, I can't make

2424
02:25:08,460 --> 02:25:10,060
communication or contact with them.

2425
02:25:10,100 --> 02:25:14,140
Have you made any money off of, you know, you're telling your, your

2426
02:25:14,140 --> 02:25:15,460
account of what had happened to you?

2427
02:25:15,460 --> 02:25:16,500
No, I don't have a book.

2428
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:18,300
I would like to try to do an audio book.

2429
02:25:18,940 --> 02:25:23,660
Uh, and someone, uh, close to me suggested that I've never done that.

2430
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:27,620
Have you faced any pushback from the colleagues or the press or people

2431
02:25:27,620 --> 02:25:30,620
are mostly people just grateful that you've told your account?

2432
02:25:31,580 --> 02:25:35,180
Uh, you know, I've had a couple of people say something before, like,

2433
02:25:35,180 --> 02:25:36,780
you know, this guy's smoking something.

2434
02:25:36,780 --> 02:25:40,140
I wish I was, I wish that's all it would have been, but either as

2435
02:25:40,140 --> 02:25:43,860
Robert Hastings once said, he goes, Mario, either you were in the right place at

2436
02:25:43,860 --> 02:25:48,060
the right time or the wrong place at the right time, but you were there no matter

2437
02:25:48,060 --> 02:25:53,580
what and he coined it for me and I have the greatest respect for that man ever.

2438
02:25:53,740 --> 02:25:53,980
Yeah.

2439
02:25:53,980 --> 02:25:57,740
Well, it's super clear just speaking to you, how matter of fact you are and

2440
02:25:58,580 --> 02:26:04,460
how, uh, yeah, just descriptive the account is, I mean, I, I, I feel like

2441
02:26:04,460 --> 02:26:07,980
I have decent pattern matching when it comes to people bullshitting me for a

2442
02:26:07,980 --> 02:26:12,380
job, I, you know, invested companies and stuff, so it's like kind of the ultimate,

2443
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:15,780
like the only thing, you know, you can't be an expert in everything and you kind

2444
02:26:15,780 --> 02:26:17,540
of just have to be sussing out people.

2445
02:26:18,140 --> 02:26:20,420
And so, uh, you passed my test, man.

2446
02:26:20,420 --> 02:26:24,820
And I'm sure you did the entire audience at Mario really appreciate it, man.

2447
02:26:24,820 --> 02:26:25,700
This was amazing.

2448
02:26:25,700 --> 02:26:30,500
And yeah, thanks for your time and for your service and, uh, for, for going public.

2449
02:26:30,820 --> 02:26:31,580
Ambassador.

2450
02:26:32,060 --> 02:26:33,260
I've heard that word before.

2451
02:26:33,340 --> 02:26:35,420
Ambassador, ET ambassador.

2452
02:26:35,420 --> 02:26:36,180
I've heard that before.

2453
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:37,220
I don't know.

2454
02:26:37,220 --> 02:26:37,620
It's true.
