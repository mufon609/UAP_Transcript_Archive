1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes, sir, General Hanley, sir.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Good evening, sir.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Captain.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry to summon you at this hour, sir,

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
but we have flash traffic, unidentified, highly unusual.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I thought you should see for yourself.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
All right, let's take a look at it.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Carry on.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It tripped the fence at 2220 off the coast of Oregon.

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Repeated calls for identification go unanswered.

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Initial trajectory?

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
South by southeast.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What about other aircraft here, or missile testing?

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Negative.

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
DOCTO C MUSIC

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
10.

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hut.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
As you were.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Bearing is 0.319.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Target dropped off the screen at 2226 and touched down in the vicinity.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We don't know that.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We don't know that.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We don't know that.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We don't know that.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We don't know that.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We don't know that.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We don't know that.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We don't know that.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,160
As you were.

31
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,420
Bearing is 0.319.

32
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,960
Target dropped off the screen at 2226 and touched down in the vicinity.

33
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,020
We don't know that.

34
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:25,660
Sir we triangulated its descent and have concluded that it did land roughly 200 miles east of

35
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,660
Lincoln Nebraska.

36
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,660
My God.

37
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,660
Well, that can't be.

38
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,660
Those maneuvers that break any pilot's neck.

39
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,660
All right, Lieutenant,

40
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,660
I want you to start your written report immediately.

41
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,660
You will use the radar tapes as supportive information.

42
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,660
Negative.

43
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,660
Object she tracked was a bull-eyed meteor.

44
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,660
And that's what the report would read.

45
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,660
Excuse me, sir.

46
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,660
With all due respect,

47
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,660
meteors don't rise or change directions.

48
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,660
You saw it yourself on the screen.

49
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,660
Lieutenant, I saw a bull-eyed.

50
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,660
The anomalous characteristic

51
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,660
must have been due to a computer malfunction.

52
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,660
I suggested each of you check your equipment.

53
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,660
I don't want to see this happen again.

54
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,660
Captain, you will erase the radar tapes immediately.

55
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,660
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

56
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,660
And you will instruct your people

57
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,660
not to discuss this event with anyone.

58
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,660
Understood?

59
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,660
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,660
This is Hanley.

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,660

63
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,660
We have a confirmed angel.

64
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,660
Repeat.

65
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,660
Confirmed angel.

66
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,660
Touchdown.

67
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,660
Midwest sector.

68
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,660
Procedure, Zebra, Echo, Zebra.

69
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,660
Now and then.

70
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,660
We have a confirmed angel.

71
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
Repeat.

72
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,660
Confirmed angel.

73
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,660
Touchdown.

74
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,660
Midwest sector.

75
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,660
Procedure, Zebra, Echo, Zebra.

76
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,660
Now and then.

77
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,660
It's freezing out there.

78
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,660
Yeah?

79
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,660
Yeah.

80
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,660
That's good.

81
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,660
My God!

82
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,660
What happened?

83
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,660
Honey, honey, are you all right?

84
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,660
Carl!

85
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,660
Get me something to put around her!

86
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,660
Come on.

87
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,660
Everything's going to be all right.

88
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,660
Come on.

89
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,660
Get me something to put around her!

90
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,660
Come on.

91
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
Everything's going to be all right.

92
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
You'll see, everything's going to be just fine.

93
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,660
Sit down right here.

94
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,660
You just sit right there.

95
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
Get you a nice warm.

96
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,660
That's right.

97
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,660
Yes.

98
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,660
Carl, get that pot of coffee now.

99
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,660
I'll do you up.

100
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,660
Oh, my God.

101
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,660
You'll be all right.

102
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
Come on.

103
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,660
Ma'am.

104
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,660
It's OK.

105
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,660
It's OK.

106
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,660
Take it easy.

107
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,660
You're all right.

108
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,660
You're OK.

109
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,660
Now, where do you live?

110
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
Have you ever seen her before, Bonnie?

111
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,660
Never.

112
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,660
And you have no idea what happened or how she got here?

113
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,660
She hasn't said a word.

114
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,660
You better get her to a doctor fast.

115
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,660
I agree.

116
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,660
Come on.

117
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,660
Come on.

118
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,660
Come on.

119
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,660
It's all right.

120
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,660
Come on.

121
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
Come on.

122
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,660
The nearest hospital's in Alliance.

123
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Alliance.

124
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,660
That's right.

125
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,660
Alliance.

126
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,660
Is that where you're from?

127
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,660
Ah!

128
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,660
Lady, don't do that.

129
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,660
You have scared me to death.

130
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,660
No.

131
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,660
Mary.

132
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,660
What's that?

133
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,660
My name.

134
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,660
You said you wanted to know my name.

135
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
I remember now.

136
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,660
Mary Wilkes.

137
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,660
That's good.

138
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,660
That's good.

139
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,660
You think you could tell me where you live?

140
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,660
On a farm outside Northgate.

141
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,660
That's a good 30 miles from here.

142
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,660
How'd you ever end up all the way out here?

143
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,660
I don't know.

144
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,660
Just...

145
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,660
I don't know.

146
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,660
I don't know.

147
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,660
I can't remember.

148
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,660
Please just take me home.

149
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,660
It's OK.

150
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
I'll take you home.

151
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,660
All right?

152
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,660
I'm taking you home.

153
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
Well, I think I at least ought to see inside.

154
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,660
I'd like to speak with your husband.

155
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,660
He's not here.

156
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,660
He's on a trucking run in Colorado.

157
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
I'm really tired.

158
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,660
My boy's inside alone.

159
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,660
Thank you.

160
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,660
OK, I'll file my report with what I got,

161
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,660
but I want you to promise me something.

162
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Yeah?

163
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,660
The minute you remember anything else, anything at all,

164
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,660
I want you to contact the local police.

165
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,660
I will.

166
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,660
Thank you.

167
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Yeah, yeah.

171
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,660
There's a phone company truck outside my window here,

172
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,660
and it's making a lot of noise.

173
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,660
It's 3 o'clock in the morning, for God's sake.

174
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660
The business office is closed, ma'am.

175
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
It opens at 9 a.m.

176
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,660
I can give you the number if you wish to lodge a complaint.

177
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,660
The business office is closed, ma'am.

178
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,660
It opens at 9 a.m.

179
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,660
I can give you the number if you wish to lodge a complaint.

181
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
No!

No!

183
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,660
No!

184
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,660
Neil, I can use some help.

185
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,660
It's one of my patients, Leslie Hahn.

186
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,660
She's been having some very unusual dissociative episodes lately.

187
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,660
What are you getting?

188
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,660
Uncertain.

189
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,660
She may have been victimized by early sexual abuse.

190
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,660
I've got her on clonopin, one and a half milligrams twice a day.

191
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,660
She seemed to be responding,

192
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,660
but then I got a call early this morning about 6 o'clock.

193
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,660
She was in a blind panic.

194
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,660
She sounded manic, paranoid.

195
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,660
What triggered it?

196
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Some story about being assaulted last night.

197
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,660
Get this.

198
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,660
She said it involved telephone repairmen.

199
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,660
I think it might be time for some regressive hypnosis.

200
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,660
Why don't you let me talk to her first?

201
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,660
Give her my home address.

202
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,660
Tell her to come by around 8.

203
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,660
Okay.

204
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660
Look, send them in.

205
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,660
Morning, doctor.

206
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,660
I've been wanting to talk to you.

207
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,660
I understand you put one of my patients back on the street again.

208
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,660
We've been through this before.

209
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,660
You can't hold someone in a mental hospital

210
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,660
just because they're acting weird and disgusting.

211
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,660
We'd have half the city in here.

212
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,660
The woman peas down subway greetings.

213
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,660
She camps out in front of Neiman Marcus, chanting obscenities.

214
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,660
She hit a rabbi in the head with a grapefruit.

215
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,660
What does she have to do, Stanley, shoot the president?

216
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,660
Neil, you're a very talented man.

217
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,660
But before you came here,

218
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,660
the average stay in the East Wing was two weeks.

219
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,660
Now it's 4.5 weeks.

220
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,660
That is totally unacceptable.

221
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,660
I know what my patients need,

222
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,660
and it's not getting snowed on Haldol

223
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,660
and being dumped on the streets before they're ready.

224
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,660
Stanley, your system stinks.

225
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,660
This medical center has operated successfully for decades, doctor,

226
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,660
long before you showed up on your high horse.

227
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,660
I have four people in emergency.

228
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,660
I've got no place for them.

229
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,660
I need two beds from your ward,

230
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,660
whichever ones, that's your choice.

231
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,660
But by tonight.

232
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660
Is that it?

233
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,660
That's it.

234
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,660
Better get a move on, Tim. You don't want to be late for school.

235
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,660
Mom, is Dad coming home?

236
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,660
Soon, honey, soon.

237
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,660
What kind of jam do you want on your toast?

238
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,660
Strawberry.

239
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
How soon?

240
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,660
Well, he's going to be calling home tonight,

241
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
so you can ask him yourself, okay?

242
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,660
Mom, the toast is burning.

243
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,660
Geez.

244
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,660
It's okay, it's all right.

245
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,660
I'll just put in some more.

246
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,660
What kind of jam do you want?

247
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,660
I'll just put in some more.

248
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,660
I'm sorry.

249
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,660
I'm sorry.

250
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,660
I'm sorry.

251
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,660
I'm sorry.

252
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,660
I'm sorry.

253
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,660
Leslie, I'm Dr. Chase.

254
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
Please come in.

255
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,660
I, uh...

256
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
I feel scared sometimes.

257
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,660
Like somebody's watching me.

258
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,660
Following me.

259
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,660
Tracking me.

260
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,660
I haven't felt like this since I was a kid.

261
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,660
You told Dr. Torricello about this?

262
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,660
No.

263
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,660
Not about being...

264
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
watched.

265
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
I was afraid he might think I was crazy.

266
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
I don't know, I don't know.

267
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
Maybe, maybe I am crazy.

268
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,660
Leslie, I wouldn't be in too much of a rush

269
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,660
to diagnose myself.

270
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,660
A lot of things could be going on.

271
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,660
Dr. Torricello told me something happened last night

272
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,660
involving telephone repairmen.

273
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,660
Yes, yes.

274
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,660
It scared me to death.

275
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,660
I'm still shaking.

276
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,660
Tell me about it.

277
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,660
Um...

278
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,660
I have a small house in Venice.

279
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,660
My, um, my boyfriend Ray.

280
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,660
He's a cop and he was working last night

281
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,660
so I thought I would just go to bed early.

282
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,660
I knew that they were coming to get me.

283
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,660
I wanted to run.

284
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,660
I wanted to...

285
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,660
I wanted to scream.

286
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,660
I felt like I was suffocating.

287
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,660
I don't remember much else.

288
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
But I do know that they got into the house.

289
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,660
How?

290
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,660
I don't know.

291
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,660
I just, I can't remember.

292
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,660
I don't know.

293
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,660
Did you recognize any of them?

294
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,660
Can you recall their faces?

295
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,660
You don't understand.

296
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,660
They had no faces.

297
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,660
And it's the last thing I remember.

298
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,660
The last thing I remember.

299
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,660
Until I, um, I woke up

300
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,660
naked on the couch.

301
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,660
I was sick and

302
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,660
disoriented.

303
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,660
Oh my god.

304
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,660
I just thought something was wrong with the clock

305
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
but the clock in the kitchen...

306
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,660
The clock in the kitchen

307
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,660
had the same time

308
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
so I guess about, um,

309
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
three hours had passed.

310
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,660
And you don't remember anything of what happened during that time?

311
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,660
No.

312
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,660
It's a total blank.

313
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,660
Was there any sign of forced entry?

314
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,660
You know, the doors, the windows?

315
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,660
No.

316
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,660
Everything was still locked.

317
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,660
No.

318
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,660
What's happening to me?

319
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,660
I can't sleep.

320
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,660
I start crying for no reason.

321
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,660
I can't stand being touched

322
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,660
not even by Ray.

323
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,660
He doesn't know what's going on.

324
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,660
I don't know what to tell him.

325
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,660
Please, Dr. Chase.

326
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,660
Please.

327
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
You've got to help me.

328
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,660
Mom, let's get some donuts.

329
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
My dad likes grapes.

330
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
Yeah, but your dad claims to be dieting while he's been on the road

331
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,660
so let's skip him this time, okay?

332
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,660
Next time.

333
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,660
Hey, Miss Wilkes.

334
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,660
Hi, Jeannie. How's school?

335
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,660
Boring.

336
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,660
Hey, Timmy, how are the Dodgers doing?

337
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,660
No pitching. Can't win without pitching.

338
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,660
How can we like them? Doesn't everybody hate them?

339
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,660
My aunt Lee took me to a dodger camp

340
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,660
when I was a little kid.

341
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,660
Oh, way back then, huh?

342
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,660
Mrs. Wilkes!

343
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,660
Mom, you're bleeding!

344
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,660
Any history of nosebleeds?

345
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,660
Not since I was a kid.

346
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,660
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

347
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,660
Were you experiencing headaches before this occurred?

348
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,660
No, no.

349
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,660
Runny nose? Swelling?

350
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,660
No. Infection?

351
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,660
What's happened? Out of the blue.

352
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,660
Well, well.

353
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,660
What are we here?

354
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
What?

355
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,660
You try and hold.

356
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,660
Real still.

357
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,660
Do you see something?

358
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,660
Hold real still now.

359
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,660
Something in there?

360
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,660
Ow.

361
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,660
Ow.

362
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,660
What is that?

363
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,660
I'm the foggiest.

364
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,660
Looks like, almost like a little pellet.

365
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,660
Or it could be part of a larger object

366
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,660
that's broken off.

367
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,660
Any idea how this could have become lodged

368
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,660
in your nasal cavity?

369
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,660
No, I haven't.

370
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,660
You haven't?

371
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,660
No, nothing.

372
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,660
Hmm.

373
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,660
Well, it's peculiar.

374
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,660
The nosebleed probably resulted

375
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,660
from the shifting of that pellet.

376
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,660
But there might be more permanent damage.

377
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,660
There's no telling how long

378
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,660
that thing's been up there.

379
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,660
Oh.

380
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,660
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

381
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,660
There's no infection.

382
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,660
But I would try to find a specialist

383
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,660
the next time you're in Omaha.

384
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,660
I'm going to visit my sister soon

385
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,660
in Los Angeles.

386
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
Well, I hear tell there's a doctor

387
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,660
or two in that town as well.

388
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,660
Oh.

389
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,660
Oh.

390
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,660
Hey.

391
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,660
Thank you.

392
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,660
You're beautiful.

393
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,660
I really needed to see you.

394
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,660
What's wrong?

395
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,660
Leslie.

396
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,660
Hi, Ray.

397
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,660
For the antique show.

398
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,660
Think we can unload it?

399
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,660
Rita, that is really, really terrible.

400
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,660
What do you think, Leslie?

401
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,660
Leslie?

402
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
Leslie.

403
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,660
Leslie.

404
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,660
Leslie.

405
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,660
No, just keep it away from me, Ray.

406
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,660
Would you take me home, please?

407
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,660
I don't feel very well.

408
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,660
Hey.

409
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,660
You know, I wouldn't mind if just once

410
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,660
you'd let your guard down and let me in.

411
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,660
Just once.

412
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,660
I do let you in.

413
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,660
No, you don't.

414
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,660
We've been together

415
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,660
nearly a year now.

416
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,660
Every time I get too close, you pull away.

417
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,660
You're doing it right now.

418
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,660
I'm sorry, Ray.

419
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,660
I'm sorry.

420
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,660
It's just that I'm...

421
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,660
I'm so tired.

422
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,660
I know.

423
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,660
I worry about you.

424
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,660
I don't want you to.

425
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,660
I do.

426
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,660
Look, I gotta be getting back.

427
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,660
Okay.

428
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,660
Leslie, you sure you want me

429
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,660
to come by tonight?

430
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,660
Yeah, I'm sure.

431
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,660
Okay. I'll see you later.

432
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,660
Okay.

433
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,660
Thanks for the flowers.

434
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,660
Excuse me!

435
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,660
What are you men doing here?

436
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,660
Geological survey.

437
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,660
Hey!

438
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,660
Hey! I want the truth!

439
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,660
What are you doing here?

440
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,660
I told you once, lady.

441
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,660
A survey.

442
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,660
You're a liar!

443
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,660
Hey!

444
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,660
What are you doing here?

445
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,660
I told you once, lady.

446
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,660
A survey.

447
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,660
You're a liar!

448
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,660
They're lying.

449
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,660
You know what I think?

450
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,660
I think you're nuts!

451
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,660
You got a zoo here, Doc!

452
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,660
I mean, really!

453
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,660
What are you talking about, a zoo?

454
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,660
What the hell's the matter with you?

455
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,660
A woman who thinks she's a wolf?

456
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,660
General Patton through the heating ducts?

457
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,660
Who let these wackos in here?

458
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,660
Wake up and smell the coffee, folks!

459
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,660
Hey!

460
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,660
Hey! Watch your mouth, stupid!

461
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,660
Jose! Jose!

462
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,660
Jose!

463
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,660
Jose!

464
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,660
Jose!

465
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,660
Jose, help me!

466
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,660
Mr. Waxheimer, we all have problems.

467
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,660
We're trying to help one another.

468
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,660
Now, just help us out

469
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,660
and let Jim take you back to your room, please.

470
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,660
Thank you.

471
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,660
It's not right.

472
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,660
I know.

473
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,660
You shouldn't say that.

474
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,660
I know. I know.

475
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,660
All right, people, that's it for today.

476
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,660
Please leave your work on the table

477
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,660
and be sure your name's on it.

478
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,660
Mr. Randall?

479
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,660
Mr. Randall?

480
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,660
Would you please leave your watercolor over here?

481
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,660
Sure.

482
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
Why not?

483
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,660
Okay, let's see.

484
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,660
Hmm.

485
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,660
I don't have much of an art career

486
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,660
waiting for me, do I?

487
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,660
I think it's very interesting.

488
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,660
What?

489
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,660
What?

490
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,660
I like him.

491
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,660
I like him, Doc.

492
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
He thinks I got talent.

493
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,660
Don't tell him that's the only thing

494
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,660
I know how to paint.

495
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,660
Do you want to buy it?

496
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,660
Oh, come on.

497
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,660
I got a trunkload of them in my locker.

498
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,660
Not today.

499
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,660
No, huh?

500
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,660
Luann?

501
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,660
Come on, baby. I'll walk you home.

502
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,660
Come on.

503
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,660
It is the only thing he ever paints.

504
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,660
I've got Leslie's test results.

505
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,660
And?

506
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,660
All normal.

507
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,660
That's good news.

508
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,660
Neil, she's becoming more and more panicky.

509
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,660
She's obsessed with those missing hours.

510
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,660
I think she's ready.

511
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,660
Okay, let's give it a shot.

512
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,660
Set up a session at my house Thursday night.

513
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,660
They're coming for me.

514
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,660
I can see them.

515
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,660
They're coming.

516
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,660
Who is?

517
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,660
Who are they?

518
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,660
I don't know who they are.

519
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,660
I don't know.

520
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,660
What do you want?

521
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,660
I'm afraid of them.

522
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Please don't touch me.

523
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,660
Don't be afraid, Leslie.

524
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Don't be afraid.

525
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,660
This is not happening now.

526
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,660
This is all in the past.

527
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,660
No!

528
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,660
Stay away from me!

529
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,660
They're coming through the walls!

530
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,660
I can't move.

531
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
They're putting me on a table.

532
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,660
And I can't move.

533
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,660
Oh, God!

534
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,660
They're taking off my clothes!

535
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Oh, God!

536
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,660
Oh, God!

537
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,660
Oh, God!

538
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,660
Oh, God!

539
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,660
Oh, God!

540
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,660
Stop them!

541
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,660
Please stop them!

542
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,660
Leslie, close your eyes.

543
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,660
Close your eyes, Leslie, now.

544
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,660
This is not happening now.

545
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,660
It's not happening now, Leslie.

546
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,660
This is all in the past.

547
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,660
You're safe.

548
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
You're here in my office.

549
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,660
They can't hurt you, do you understand?

550
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,660
Yes.

551
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,660
Good.

552
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,660
Because at the count of three,

553
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,660
I want you to look at them.

554
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,660
I want you to look at them.

555
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
And you'll be able to see their faces much more clearly.

556
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
No, Leslie.

557
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,660
Leslie, remember.

558
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,660
You're not there.

559
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,660
All right, you ready?

560
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,660
Yes.

561
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,660
Hey.

562
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,660
One, two, three.

563
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,660
Can you describe them, Leslie?

564
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
Can you tell me what they look like?

565
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,660
They're not...

566
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,660
They're not evil!

567
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,660
What do they look like?

568
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,660
They have...

569
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,660
thin little grey bodies.

570
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,660
Big heads.

571
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,660
Big black eyes.

572
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,660
I don't like their eyes.

573
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,660
Leslie, are you still in your dining room?

574
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,660
No.

575
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,660
Somewhere else.

576
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,660
Somewhere else.

577
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,660
Where?

578
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,660
On...

579
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,660
On the ship.

580
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,660
Oh, God.

581
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,660
There's another one coming now.

582
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,660
What's this one look like?

583
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,660
He says he's the doctor.

584
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,660
Did he tell you that?

585
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,660
No.

586
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,660
But I know what he's thinking.

587
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,660
He knows what I'm thinking.

588
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,660
No.

589
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,660
No.

590
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,660
Please don't.

591
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,660
He's spreading my legs.

592
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,660
No, please!

593
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,660
No.

594
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,660
Please don't, please don't.

595
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,660
Listen, it's not happening now.

596
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,660
This is not happening now.

597
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,660
I'm going to count to three.

598
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,660
And when I do,

599
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,660
you will wake up.

600
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,660
One.

601
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,660
You're back in that restful,

602
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,660
beautiful, peaceful place again.

603
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,660
Two.

604
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,660
You're relaxing.

605
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,660
You're relaxing.

606
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,660
Three.

607
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,660
You're awake.

608
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,660
Three.

609
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,660
So how do you feel?

610
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,660
I don't know.

611
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,660
These people you told us about,

612
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,660
can you draw me a picture of them?

613
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,660
I can try.

614
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,660
No.

615
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,660
Will you please tell me what the hell is going on?

616
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,660
Who broke into her house the other night?

617
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,660
Aliens? Ghosts?

618
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,660
No, of course not.

619
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,660
Something happened.

620
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,660
It may not have happened the way she saw it.

621
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,660
And it may not have happened that night.

622
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,660
Are you saying some kind of sexual abuse?

623
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,660
Possibly.

624
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,660
A childhood assault.

625
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,660
Rape.

626
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,660
Maybe even incest.

627
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,660
It's just too painful for her to remember,

628
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,660
so she buries it.

629
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,660
Instead of seeing the true

630
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,660
assaulter or assaulters,

631
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,660
she sees something else.

632
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,660
See, her mind is not

633
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,660
quite ready to accept

634
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,660
what it really was.

635
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,660
Not yet.

636
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,660
Not yet.

637
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,660
You have to be patient, Rae.

638
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,660
You have to understand what she's going through.

639
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,660
You okay?

640
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,660
Feeling better?

641
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,660
Yeah.

642
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,660
You asked me who they were, Dr. Chase.

643
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,660
I don't know.

644
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,660
But I do know

645
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,660
what they're after.

646
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,660
It's me.

647
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,660
The piece of me.

648
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,660
My skin.

649
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,660
My blood.

650
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,660
That's what they want.

651
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,660
And they're going to be coming

652
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,660
again.

653
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,660
I know it.

654
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,660
You can't just look at one symptom.

655
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
You have to see the whole picture.

656
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,660
With all of her anxiety,

657
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,660
she's still a solid, functioning, integrated person.

658
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,660
If she were psychotic, she couldn't have been

659
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,660
hypnotized so easily.

660
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,660
Really? Then where did all that stuff come from?

661
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,660
Aliens in spaceships?

662
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,660
Little gray people with burning black

663
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,660
eyes? Wait a minute.

664
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,660
She's making this up, right?

665
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,660
Well, I'm quite sure she's not

666
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,660
consciously lying. Her emotions are very

667
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,660
real. Have you ever encountered

668
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,660
other cases missing time?

669
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,660
Other cases?

670
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,660
There was a guy, uh, beach

671
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,660
or leech or something,

672
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,660
and he was making the rounds a while back, asking

673
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,660
questions about the same sort of thing.

674
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,660
It was all very similar to your case, missing

675
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,660
time.

676
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,660
UFOs? Yeah, I think it did

677
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,660
involve UFOs.

678
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,660
Perfect. That's all we need.

679
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,660
Well, I think you should

680
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,660
at least speak with the man. I'll search through

681
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,660
my files, see if I can come up with his name,

682
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,660
and if I do, I'll put him in touch with you.

683
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
Good night, sweetheart.

684
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,660
We get to see daddy tomorrow.

685
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,660
Good night.

686
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,660
I'll check for monsters first.

687
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,660
Okay.

688
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,660
None in there?

689
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,660
No.

690
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,660
Okay.

691
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,660
Okay.

692
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,660
Okay.

693
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,660
Okay.

694
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,660
Okay.

695
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,660
None in there.

696
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,660
There's none over there.

697
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,660
And none under

698
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,660
there. There are no

699
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,660
monsters to be found.

700
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,660
So little boys can

701
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,660
close their eyes and drift

702
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,660
away.

703
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,660
Okay.

704
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,660
Wait, could you

705
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,660
leave it on?

706
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,660
Yes.

707
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,660
Okay.

708
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,660
Night.

709
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,660
Night.

710
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,660
Night.

711
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,660
Okay, Silent Sam.

712
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,660
You want to talk about it?

713
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,660
Nothing to talk about.

714
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,660
Aren't you sleeping at night?

715
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,660
What's wrong, Tim, huh?

716
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,660
I know something's bothering you.

717
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,660
You can talk to me.

718
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,660
Dad! Dad's back!

719
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,660
There's my big man.

720
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,660
Come on.

721
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,660
Come on.

722
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,660
Oh, boy.

723
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,660
I missed you.

724
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,660
Who's this right here?

725
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,660
All right, put a little on it.

726
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,660
There you go.

727
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,660
There you go.

728
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,660
You can fly ball.

729
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,660
Fly ball, get under it.

730
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,660
Attaboy. Attaboy.

731
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,660
Attaboy.

732
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,660
Oh, looky there.

733
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,660
The prettiest girl in the county.

734
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,660
I wonder who she's going out to dinner with tonight.

735
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,660
Well, I might not be if you don't get yourself in

736
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,660
and get changed.

737
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,660
I'll be in there in just a few minutes.

738
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,660
Okay.

739
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,660
Dad, do you have to go out tonight?

740
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,660
Hey, champ, I got to show your mom

741
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,660
a good time once in a while.

742
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,660
Besides, you ought to be happy. Sharon's coming over

743
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,660
to see it. Attaboy.

744
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,660
I don't care. I don't want you to go.

745
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,660
Hey, hey,

746
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,660
hey, hey.

747
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,660
Now, son, we've talked about this.

748
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,660
Now, you know

749
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,660
your mom and I need some time together.

750
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,660
Timmy, this isn't like you.

751
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,660
What is it? What's the matter, son?

752
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,660
It's...

753
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,660
It's mom.

754
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,660
Well, what about mom?

755
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,660
She scares me now.

756
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,660
Come here.

757
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,660
Come here.

758
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,660
Come on.

759
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,660
Oh, my God.

760
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,660
Oh, my gosh.

761
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,660
Come on.

762
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,660
If I haven't laughed, it's hard to do.

763
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,660
You know, I don't know how long.

764
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,660
Oh. Well, it sure is nice

765
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,660
to see you having fun again.

766
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,660
Things have seemed a lot serious

767
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,660
since I've been home.

768
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,660
I had a talk with Timmy

769
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,660
now.

770
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,660
He says things haven't been

771
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,660
right with you.

772
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,660
He's, uh...

773
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,660
Well, the boy's scared

774
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,660
is what he is. The boy's scared.

775
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,660
It must have been a trip I took

776
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,660
to see Doc Holton and...

777
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,660
What trip to see Doc Holton?

778
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,660
I had a nosebleed

779
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,660
and he was with me

780
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,660
and, you know, I mean,

781
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,660
it was just a nosebleed, but

782
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,660
he was scared, probably.

783
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,660
And why was it you didn't tell me about that?

784
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,660
Because it was a nosebleed.

785
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,660
It wasn't anything.

786
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,660
I'm gonna go have it rechecked

787
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,660
when I go to visit Lee.

788
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,660
Honey, why are you so nervous?

789
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,660
What's happening?

790
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,660
Nothing's happening.

791
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,660
Don't get upset about it.

792
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,660
Don't get upset.

793
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,660
It's okay. That's not what you're thinking.

794
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,660
Well, it's not.

795
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,660
I wouldn't lie to you about that.

796
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,660
Honey, I know you wouldn't.

797
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,660
But I want you always to remember

798
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,660
what I told you.

799
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,660
If old troubles do come back,

800
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,660
this old boy's gonna stand

801
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,660
next to you no matter what.

802
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,660
Okay?

803
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,660
You know something?

804
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,660
I just got a great idea.

805
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,660
To do?

806
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,660
Mm-hmm.

807
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,660
This is for the kids.

808
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,660
We haven't been up here in years.

809
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,660
Well, then I say we're overdue, huh?

810
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,660
Well, time sure have changed.

811
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,660
I can remember when you had

812
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,660
to fight for a spot out here.

813
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,660
It's a school night, remember?

814
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,660
Yeah, well...

815
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,660
That never stopped us.

816
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,660
Oh.

817
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,660
It's quarter to.

818
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,660
We'd best get going.

819
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,660
Mm-hmm.

820
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,660
But I want to come

821
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,660
back here again.

822
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,660
Makes me feel like a kid again.

823
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,660
What you looking at, honey?

824
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:52,660
That star over there?

825
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:54,660
It's not a star. Stars don't move.

826
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,660
Well, it's probably an airplane or something.

827
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,660
What is it?

828
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,660
What is it?

829
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,660
What are you getting so upset about?

830
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,660
It's only a...

831
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,660
No, it's not.

832
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,660
Oh.

833
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,660
I want to come back.

834
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,660
Who's coming?

835
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,660
They always come back for me. Please.

836
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,660
Darling, sit them down. It's all right.

837
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,660
No! I won't let them take me.

838
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,660
There isn't anybody coming. No!

839
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,660
Mary! Mary!

840
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,660
Mary!

841
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,660
It's all right!

842
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,660
It's all right!

843
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,660
Mary, it's okay.

844
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,660
No!

845
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,660
No!

846
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,660
It's all right!

847
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,660
It's all right.

848
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,660
It's just a helicopter!

849
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,660
That's all it is!

850
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,660
It's just a helicopter!

851
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,660
It hits all the bugs.

852
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,660
Just a helicopter.

853
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,660
It's all right.

854
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,660
It's all right.

855
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,660
It's just a helicopter.

856
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,660
You expecting someone?

857
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,660
No.

858
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,660
You must be Neil Chase.

859
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,660
Ah, you must be, um,

860
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,660
what, wife, girlfriend?

861
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,660
Daughter.

862
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,660
Oh, the man has such excellent genes.

863
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,660
Haven't eaten yet, I hope.

864
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,660
Bought some Thai, my treat.

865
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,660
Now, uh,

866
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,660
this way to the kitchen, I presume.

867
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,660
Ah, Caesar salad. Perfect.

868
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,660
It's just as if you knew what I was bringing.

869
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,660
Would you mind telling me who the hell you are?

870
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,660
Ah, yes. Where's my head?

871
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,660
Of course I know you, but you, of course, do not know me.

872
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,660
My name is Addison Leach.

873
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,660
But what's in a name?

874
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,660
Still doesn't tell you what I do, does it?

875
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,660
I'm a ufologist.

876
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,660
My specialty is abductions.

877
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,660
That pretty little Japanese doctor

878
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,660
at the hospital contacted me

879
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,660
and told me of your interest.

880
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,660
I figured since I was springing for the grub,

881
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,660
you'd be delighted to see me.

882
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,660
Well, I'm here.

883
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,660
You're here.

884
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,660
I'm hungry. You're hungry.

885
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,660
None of us have eaten.

886
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,660
That's synchronicity, if you ask me.

887
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,660
So why don't we have some dinner?

888
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,660
And I'll wise you up to some of the things

889
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,660
I think you ought to know.

890
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,660
What do you say?

891
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,660
They occur with a certain regularity,

892
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,660
but nobody pays any attention,

893
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,660
except for a few of us who know better.

894
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,660
Have you learned enough to know better, doctor?

895
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,660
If you mean, do I believe in flying saucers?

896
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,660
Absolutely not.

897
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,660
Well, you seem like an intelligent man.

898
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,660
You'll change your mind.

899
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,660
The phenomena is worldwide, you know.

900
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,660
I've investigated sightings

901
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,660
from Senegal to Manitoba.

902
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,660
The abductions in the Congo

903
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,660
are virtually identical

904
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,660
to the investigations you've been making here.

905
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,660
I'm not investigating abductions.

906
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,660
Oh?

907
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,660
Missing time?

908
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,660
Little gray man, large eyes?

909
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,660
Medical probes? Sounds familiar?

910
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,660
Take 100 sightings.

911
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,660
60 aren't even reported.

912
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,660
25 are honest misidentifications.

913
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,660
10 are BS of the National Enquirer variety.

914
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,660
And the remaining five?

915
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,660
Ah, the remaining five.

916
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,660
Amazing, incredible,

917
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,660
totally unidentified

918
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,660
and entirely real.

919
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,660
I've been onto abductions for years now,

920
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,660
long before they became fashionable.

921
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,660
Look,

922
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,660
I didn't just come here to have dinner

923
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,660
and have a few laughs.

924
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,660
We need each other, Doctor.

925
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,660
How do you figure that?

926
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,660
I've been hosting

927
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,660
regular meetings of abductees in my house,

928
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,660
a sort of group therapy session, if you like.

929
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,660
We are in dire need

930
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,660
of a professional,

931
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,660
someone who can help heal them

932
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,660
and lend credibility to their plight.

933
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,660
You just don't get it, do you, Leach?

934
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,660
I'm not interested in UFOs.

935
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,660
I didn't like fairy tales when I was a kid.

936
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,660
But one of your own patients

937
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,660
is an adoptee, Doctor.

938
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,660
You can look for answers in the stars,

939
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,660
Mr. Leach.

940
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,660
I'll find mine right here on Earth.

941
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,660
You know, I've never understood

942
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,660
you so-called men of science.

943
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,660
Something comes along, exciting,

944
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,660
and wildly important,

945
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,660
and you turn your back on it

946
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,660
just because it doesn't happen to fit inside

947
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,660
your little box-like view of the universe.

948
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,660
Don't bother, Doctor.

949
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,660
I'll find my own way out.

950
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,660
Good night, young lady.

951
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,660
You're not scientists!

952
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,660
You're cowards!

953
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,660
Come on.

954
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,660
I kind of liked him.

955
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,660
He's funny.

956
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,660
You're funny.

957
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,660
I can't.

958
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,660
Funny.

959
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,660
Thank you.

960
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,660
Thank you very much.

961
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,660
Hi, guys!

962
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,660
Whoa, Timmy!

963
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,660
Look at you!

964
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,660
You got so big, I don't believe it!

965
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,660
Here, give me that. Oh, Mary!

966
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,660
Great to see you.

967
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,660
How was your flight? It was smooth.

968
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,660
Did you get to see a movie?

969
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,660
Yeah.

970
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,660
What do you think, huh?

971
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,660
I bet you're hungry.

972
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,660
What do you say to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

973
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,660
and a big glass of milk? Yeah!

974
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,660
Can I get you some iced tea, Lee?

975
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,660
Oh, that sounds good. It's really hot today.

976
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,660
I think we can go swimming.

977
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,660
I still have no idea how I got to that diner.

978
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,660
I have no memory of it at all.

979
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,660
Had you been drinking?

980
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,660
No.

981
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,660
I haven't touched a drop in years.

982
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,660
I haven't... No.

983
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,660
It was different, Lee.

984
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,660
This was different.

985
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,660
I think I'm going crazy.

986
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,660
Oh.

987
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,660
I don't know.

988
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,660
I think I'm going crazy.

989
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,660
I think I'm going crazy.

990
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,660
I think I'm going crazy.

991
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,660
Oh.

992
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,660
Do you remember when we were little

993
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,660
we heard that tornado warning

994
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,660
for the next county coming over Dad's radio?

995
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,660
Yes, I remember.

996
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,660
Every time the wind blew in the house creek

997
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,660
you'd get the jitters.

998
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,660
Yeah, I was really scared.

999
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,660
For days I kept looking out the window

1000
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,660
waiting for the funnel cloud to appear.

1001
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,660
But you weren't scared at all.

1002
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,660
Remember?

1003
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,660
It got me through it, you know that?

1004
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,660
It did.

1005
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,660
It was like that a lot when we were growing up.

1006
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,660
Even though I was the older one

1007
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,660
I always knew I could count on you for strength.

1008
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,660
That's not the way I remember it.

1009
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,660
Well, that's the way it was.

1010
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,660
You were stronger.

1011
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,660
Still are.

1012
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,660
That's why I know you'll come through this okay.

1013
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,660
That's why I know you'll come through this okay.

1014
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,660
Whatever it is.

1015
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,660
Oh, Mary.

1016
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,660
What?

1017
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,660
Your nose is bleeding.

1018
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,660
Here.

1019
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,660
Oh, not again.

1020
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,660
Look, I don't know about all this other stuff

1021
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,660
but we better get this nosebleed thing checked out.

1022
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,660
Come on.

1023
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,660
The doctor will be with you in a moment.

1024
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,660
Okay, thank you.

1025
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,660
Thank you.

1026
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,660
Mrs. Wilkes.

1027
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,660
Good afternoon.

1028
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,660
I am Dr. Akkar.

1029
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,660
Hello.

1030
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,660
Yes.

1031
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:10,660
I understand you're

1032
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,660
having trouble with your nasal passages.

1033
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,660
Yes.

1034
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,660
Some periodic bleeding?

1035
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,660
That's right, yes.

1036
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,660
Has anyone looked at it in your hometown?

1037
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,660
No.

1038
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,660
Not really.

1039
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,660
Please.

1040
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,660
Okay.

1041
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,660
Well,

1042
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,660
let's see if we can't discover what the problem is.

1043
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,660
Please.

1044
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,660
Okay.

1045
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,660
Please, try and be still.

1046
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:54,660
Sorry.

1047
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,660
I'm sorry.

1048
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,660
Okay.

1049
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,660
It shouldn't

1050
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,660
take

1051
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,660
too long.

1052
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,660
Dr. Akkar?

1053
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,660
You did say you had no

1054
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,660
past surgery. That's right.

1055
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:24,660
Are you sure of that?

1056
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,660
Yeah.

1057
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,660
Why?

1058
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,660
Because your x-rays show quite different.

1059
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,660
What?

1060
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,660
I'd like to know who did it.

1061
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,660
He's damn good.

1062
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,660
The best I've ever seen. Did what?

1063
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,660
I have never had any surgery.

1064
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,660
Mrs. Wilkes,

1065
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,660
it simply couldn't have happened

1066
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,660
without your knowledge.

1067
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,660
Will you please tell me what on earth you're talking about?

1068
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,660
Extremely complex

1069
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,660
nasal surgery.

1070
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,660
Performed on you

1071
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,660
several times.

1072
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,660
Most recently, within the past

1073
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,660
six months.

1074
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,660
Ray? Ray, this is your day off, right?

1075
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,660
Listen, I think

1076
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,660
you'd better come get Leslie.

1077
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,660
She's not well again.

1078
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,660
Yes. Yes, take her to the

1079
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,660
doctor, Ray.

1080
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,660
This has gone on too long.

1081
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,660
Good.

1082
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,660
All right. Bye.

1083
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,660
Got your test results.

1084
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,660
There's a nasty virus

1085
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,660
going around. Fever, chills, occasional

1086
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,660
vomiting. Please, don't

1087
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,660
remind me. But you haven't got it.

1088
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,660
Congratulations.

1089
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,660
At least I hope you'll think it's

1090
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,660
good news. You're pregnant.

1091
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,660
Pregnant?

1092
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,660
Are you sure?

1093
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,660
You want to see for yourself?

1094
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,660
Yeah.

1095
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,660
Oh, my God.

1096
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,660
Hold it.

1097
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,660
Listen.

1098
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,660
No.

1099
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,660
Remarkably vibrant

1100
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,660
little heart.

1101
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,660
I'd say you've got quite a powerful child on your hands.

1102
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,660
How do you feel?

1103
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,660
Oh.

1104
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,660
Confused.

1105
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,660
Let me ask you.

1106
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,660
That picture on the television screen,

1107
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,660
that's not the actual size

1108
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,660
of the baby, is it? Yes, it is.

1109
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:22,660
You're well into your fourth month.

1110
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,660
Oh, no, no.

1111
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,660
This has got to be a mistake.

1112
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,660
It's no mistake.

1113
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,660
You're due about the second week in April.

1114
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,660
But Ray and I,

1115
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,660
for a while

1116
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,660
now, we've hardly been

1117
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,660
together.

1118
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:40,660
We've been so careful.

1119
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,660
I never missed a period.

1120
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:44,660
You've probably been experiencing

1121
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,660
some heavy spotting.

1122
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:48,660
There's nothing to be alarmed about.

1123
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,660
We'll keep an eye on it.

1124
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,660
But from this point on,

1125
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,660
you've got to remember to take

1126
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,660
extra good care of yourself.

1127
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,660
Okay?

1128
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,660
Yeah.

1129
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:02,660
I can't believe

1130
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,660
I can't.

1131
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,660
There you go.

1132
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,660
Looks good.

1133
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:10,660
You know, I'm amazed

1134
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:12,660
the way you look after me.

1135
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,660
That's what I'm here for, Lainey.

1136
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,660
That's good.

1137
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,660
After my divorce,

1138
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,660
I never thought I'd let any man

1139
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,660
ever get close to me again.

1140
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,660
You've been so patient, you know.

1141
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,660
I think that's

1142
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,660
what I'm most grateful for.

1143
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,660
Lizzie,

1144
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,660
I really think we should get married.

1145
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:02,660
We're gonna have a child.

1146
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,660
I love you.

1147
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,660
And just...

1148
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,660
just think about it, okay?

1149
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:16,660
Yeah.

1150
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,660
No!

1151
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,660
No!

1152
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,660
No!

1153
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,660
No!

1154
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,660
Get away from me! No!

1155
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,660
Get away from me!

1156
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,660
Get away from me!

1157
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:46,660
Get away!

1158
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,660
It's just a nightmare.

1159
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,660
No!

1160
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,660
Well, I heard you're in the office still working.

1161
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:04,660
I thought I'd better call. It's VIP time.

1162
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,660
Yeah, I heard. The woman that does the cable sports?

1163
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,660
Yeah. What's the problem?

1164
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,660
Brought her sister in a little while ago.

1165
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,660
Completely out of control, hysterical, crying.

1166
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,660
I gave her a one-milligram shot

1167
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,660
of Ativan. How's she doing?

1168
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:18,660
She's still pretty upset. Seems she had

1169
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,660
this nightmare that really scared the hell out of her.

1170
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,660
There's also a recent history of

1171
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,660
emotional problems. Where is she?

1172
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,660
Miss Holland.

1173
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:34,660
Mrs. Wilkes.

1174
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,660
This is Dr. Chase.

1175
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,660
Nice to meet you. I really appreciate you coming, doctor.

1176
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,660
I didn't know where else to take her this time of night.

1177
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,660
I'll be at the desk.

1178
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,660
Thank you.

1179
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,660
So how are you feeling now, Mrs. Wilkes?

1180
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,660
Better.

1181
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,660
Good.

1182
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,660
Why don't you start by telling me about that nightmare?

1183
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,660
Okay.

1184
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,660
I was in this

1185
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,660
big empty house.

1186
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,660
And there was this

1187
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,660
awful dog.

1188
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,660
The sedative should help. She's had hardly any sleep.

1189
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,660
That's aggravated the problem.

1190
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,660
How worried should I be?

1191
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,660
I don't know yet.

1192
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,660
When they brought her back from the diner,

1193
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,660
did she have a gynecological?

1194
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,660
She didn't say.

1195
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:42,660
Is that what you think happened? She was raped?

1196
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,660
Well, they could have taken her

1197
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,660
from the house, assaulted her, and then left her

1198
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:48,660
on the highway.

1199
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,660
That would explain how she ended up 30 miles away.

1200
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,660
But why wouldn't she remember it?

1201
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,660
It's a safety mechanism.

1202
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,660
The mind shuts off.

1203
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,660
But we may be looking at a whole

1204
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,660
different set of problems here.

1205
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,660
Do you think you could see her again?

1206
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,660
How long will she be staying with you?

1207
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,660
Until Saturday. She goes back on Saturday.

1208
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,660
Well, I have an office

1209
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,660
in my home.

1210
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,660
Bring her by tomorrow night after

1211
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,660
dinner.

1212
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,660
See what you can find out.

1213
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,660
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

1214
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:28,660
Thank you.

1215
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,660
Hi.

1216
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:00,660
Come in.

1217
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,660
Sorry about the crowd.

1218
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,660
We couldn't get us dinner.

1219
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,660
That's all right.

1220
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,660
Dr. Chase, say hello to my favorite nephew, Timmy.

1221
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,660
Timmy, how are you? Nice to meet you.

1222
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,660
Nice to meet you.

1223
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,660
Come on in.

1224
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,660
How are you, Mary?

1225
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:18,660
Fine.

1226
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,660
Please.

1227
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,660
Thank you.

1228
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,660
Well, I guess

1229
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:26,660
we ought to find something for you to do, huh?

1230
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,660
What's your favorite sport?

1231
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,660
Baseball.

1232
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,660
I don't know why I couldn't guess that.

1233
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:34,660
I, uh...

1234
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,660
I think I've got something you're gonna like.

1235
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,660
Timmy, you are a lucky guy.

1236
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,660
You're gonna love this.

1237
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,660
Here.

1238
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,660
Look at that.

1239
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,660
Oh.

1240
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,660
Oh, wow.

1241
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,660
Awesome.

1242
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,660
Awesome.

1243
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,660
It's the best collection this side of the Mississippi, huh?

1244
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,660
I had it since I was about your age.

1245
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,660
I think that should keep him busy for a while.

1246
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:10,660
These dreams are flashes

1247
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,660
when you see the dog.

1248
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,660
You know, there was a dog.

1249
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:16,660
Used to come by my house when I was a little girl.

1250
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,660
Would stand outside my window, watching me.

1251
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:24,660
Would do anything. I mean, did it ever try to attack you?

1252
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,660
No.

1253
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,660
No, I keep thinking about it.

1254
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,660
Like maybe

1255
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,660
it wasn't really a dog.

1256
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,660
But what do you mean?

1257
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,660
I don't know.

1258
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,660
Like maybe it was something else.

1259
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,660
Like what?

1260
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:50,660
I don't know. I don't know.

1261
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:54,660
Can you help me?

1262
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,660
Is there some way to find out what's happening to me?

1263
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,660
Well, if you're willing, Mary,

1264
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,660
we can try some hypnosis.

1265
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,660
Whatever.

1266
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,660
Whatever it takes, I have to find out what is happening to me.

1267
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,660
All right, Mary.

1268
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,660
I want you to let your mind drift back

1269
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,660
to the night of September the 3rd.

1270
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,660
You went to bed early.

1271
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:30,660
You were sleeping soundly.

1272
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,660
You were sleeping

1273
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,660
very, very soundly.

1274
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,660
You're in your bed

1275
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,660
very, very relaxed.

1276
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,660
There's a blue light

1277
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,660
outside my window.

1278
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,660
Can you see the clock, Mary?

1279
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:52,660
Mm-hmm.

1280
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,660
And what time is it?

1281
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,660
Quarter after 12.

1282
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,660
Can you see the clock, Mary?

1283
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,660
Mm-hmm.

1284
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,660
And what time is it?

1285
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:05,660
Quarter after 12.

1286
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:29,660
Everything okay, Mary?

1287
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:31,660
Yeah, all good.

1288
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,660
Okay.

1289
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,660
What about the clock?

1290
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:37,660
It's all right.

1291
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:39,660
I think the clock might be working.

1292
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:41,660
It's all right.

1293
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,660
It's working.

1294
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:45,660
Okay.

1295
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,660
All right.

1296
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:49,660
What about the clock?

1297
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,660
It's all right.

1298
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,660
It's all right.

1299
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:55,660
It's all right.

1300
01:13:55,660 --> 01:14:13,380
No. Please. I don't want to go with them.

1301
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:15,980
With who, Mary? Who are they?

1302
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:22,980
Little men. Little grey men. Please, don't make me go with them again.

1303
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:58,740
They're putting something in my nose.

1304
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:10,940
Ow. Ow. Ow! Oh, it hurts! Stop them! Ow, it hurts! It hurts!

1305
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:20,340
Mary, feel my hand. Mary, you're here now. You're here now. You're safe. That's not happening now.

1306
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:33,100
Mary, you're safe. You're here with me. Are you okay, Mary? I want you to relax. Relax, you're safe.

1307
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:43,460
That is absolutely incredible.

1308
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:45,500
I know.

1309
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,340
Their stories were almost identical,

1310
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:50,020
in intricate and specific detail.

1311
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:52,900
That's why I've got to know more about Mary.

1312
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:55,820
Are there any more similarities?

1313
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:58,340
Maybe there's something in your family history.

1314
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:01,580
What do you mean, like what?

1315
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,740
You're her older sister.

1316
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:08,380
You might know something that she's forgotten or repressed.

1317
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:10,860
I mean, things that are so frightening that a young girl

1318
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,100
simply can't bury them in her memory.

1319
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:17,740
You're talking about incest, sexual abuse.

1320
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,660
I know these are hard things to talk about.

1321
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:22,140
Nothing like that ever happened in our family.

1322
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,020
I know that.

1323
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,580
But these visions, these things you see.

1324
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,360
You know, you keep using these words.

1325
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,720
I mean, suppose they're not visions.

1326
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,000
What else could they be?

1327
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Why can't you accept the possibility

1328
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,920
that it might actually be true?

1329
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,000
Lee, that's fantasy.

1330
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,520
UFOs, spaceships, alien creatures?

1331
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,760
It's against all the laws of physics.

1332
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,680
What we know about reality itself.

1333
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,000
Yes, what we know.

1334
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,960
What about what we don't know?

1335
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,400
The same thing's happening to my sister

1336
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,120
that happened to that other woman.

1337
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,080
And you can't explain it.

1338
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,040
That's reality.

1339
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,560
Musial, ha ha.

1340
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,240
Boy, he sure doesn't look like he can hit like that.

1341
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,760
Stand the man, they called him.

1342
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:13,920
Oh, that was one of the greatest hitters of all time.

1343
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,920
He was the greatest.

1344
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,960
Here you go, two lemonades.

1345
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,160
Thanks.

1346
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:22,000
Look what Neil gave me.

1347
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,720
Oh, wow, his favorite X-Dodger.

1348
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,640
Where'd you get this?

1349
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,600
He was a patient of mine.

1350
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,520
Really?

1351
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:31,440
We found out that hypnosis can't overcome a good curveball.

1352
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,560
You're going to spoil him.

1353
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,720
How come every time a kid is given something good,

1354
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:39,520
some grown up always has to say, you're going to spoil him?

1355
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,400
Because that's our job.

1356
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,300
Lee?

1357
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:43,200
Yeah?

1358
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,200
I can't find Timmy's sweatshirt.

1359
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,600
Oh, OK, I'll be right there.

1360
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,240
You two stay out of trouble.

1361
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:51,080
What does she mean, stay out of trouble?

1362
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,680
That's the way girls talk.

1363
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:54,560
Yeah, right.

1364
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,120
Oh, I love these old cards.

1365
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,840
Kowazewski, hey.

1366
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,080
Now, there was another hitter.

1367
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,560
He looked like a football player, this guy.

1368
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,460
Huge guy.

1369
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,920
What are these?

1370
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,320
Hey.

1371
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,560
Did you draw these?

1372
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,480
Yeah?

1373
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,360
Hey.

1374
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,080
That's very good.

1375
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,960
That's terrific.

1376
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,080
Hey, you are an artist.

1377
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:27,440
Yeah.

1378
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,600
What are these?

1379
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:50,760
The monsters, the ones that come into my house.

1380
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,640
You mean, they make believe?

1381
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:54,800
No, they're real.

1382
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,000
Oh, how do you know they're real, Timmy?

1383
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,480
Have you seen them?

1384
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,280
No.

1385
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,480
But I hear them sometimes at night

1386
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,960
when they come from my mom.

1387
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,360
You want to talk about it?

1388
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:25,360
Hey, hey, we're pals, and we can talk about anything.

1389
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,800
Huh?

1390
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,840
And there are always creepy noises at night in old houses

1391
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:32,880
when the wood settles.

1392
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,360
No sounds you heard.

1393
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,880
That has nothing to do with anyone trying to harm your mom.

1394
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:48,560
Listen, old pal, you don't have to be afraid.

1395
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,920
There's no such thing as monsters.

1396
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,320
So they can never harm you.

1397
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,320
Do you have any promise?

1398
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,240
I cross my heart.

1399
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,640
I cross my heart.

1400
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,000
I can't thank you enough.

1401
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,880
There's no need to.

1402
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,680
I feel sort of stupid, but I don't know what your fee is.

1403
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,600
I don't know what I owe you.

1404
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:29,000
You just take care of that boy and feel better.

1405
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,200
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with more answers,

1406
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,000
but I promise I'll keep on it.

1407
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,880
You've got my number.

1408
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,960
If you need anything, call me, OK?

1409
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:36,860
Bye.

1410
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:37,760
Bye.

1411
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,040
There's my big man.

1412
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,040
How you doing?

1413
01:20:59,040 --> 01:20:59,840
Good.

1414
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:00,760
Did you miss Daddy?

1415
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:01,560
Yep.

1416
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,360
Well, not as much as I missed you.

1417
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,880
Oh, honey, welcome.

1418
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,360
I brought the limo for us.

1419
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,840
And we'd like to take it.

1420
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,800
It's going to be all we've got to say to him.

1421
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:13,800
Oh, my goodness.

1422
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,800
Oh, my goodness.

1423
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:15,800
Oh, my goodness.

1424
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,800
Oh, my goodness.

1425
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,800
Oh, my goodness.

1426
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:18,800
Oh, my goodness.

1427
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:19,800
Oh, my goodness.

1428
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:20,800
Oh, my goodness.

1429
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,800
Oh, my goodness.

1430
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,800
Oh, my goodness.

1431
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:34,320
Well, better keep these covers up tight tonight.

1432
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,320
It's going to be cold.

1433
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,360
Good night, son.

1434
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,360
You sleep good.

1435
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,360
I will all night, Dad.

1436
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,280
Good night.

1437
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,280
See you in the morning.

1438
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:49,760
You want me to keep this on?

1439
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:50,760
It's OK.

1440
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,760
You can turn it off.

1441
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:17,760
Mm.

1442
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,760
Mm.

1443
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,240
Joe.

1444
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:47,240
Joe.

1445
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,240
Wake up.

1446
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,240
There's something wrong.

1447
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,240
I can feel it.

1448
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,240
Joe.

1449
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,240
Joe.

1450
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,240
You have to wake up.

1451
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,240
Sammy.

1452
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,240
Sammy.

1453
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,240
Sammy.

1454
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,240
Sammy.

1455
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,720
Jimmy.

1456
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:13,720
Stop it.

1457
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:15,720
You leave him alone.

1458
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:18,720
Leave him in here.

1459
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,720
Leave him in here alone.

1460
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:22,720
Stop it.

1461
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,200
Stop it.

1462
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,200
Oh, Jimmy.

1463
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,200
Jimmy.

1464
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,200
Oh.

1465
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,200
Oh.

1466
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,200
Oh, thank you.

1467
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,200
I'm sorry.

1468
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,200
I'm sorry.

1469
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,200
I'm so sorry.

1470
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,160
I'm so sorry.

1471
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,160
I'm so sorry.

1472
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,160
I tried.

1473
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,160
I couldn't stop him.

1474
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,160
I'm sorry.

1475
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,160
Mommy.

1476
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,160
Mommy, you hurt me.

1477
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,160
No.

1478
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,160
Joe!

1479
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,160
Joe!

1480
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,160
Beep.

1481
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,160
Beep.

1482
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,160
Beep.

1483
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,160
Beep.

1484
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:20,160
Beep.

1485
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,160
Beep.

1486
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,160
Beep.

1487
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,160
Beep.

1488
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:31,660
It looks worse than it is.

1489
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:33,660
He's just a little dehydrated.

1490
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:35,660
Any idea what could have caused it, Doc?

1491
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:38,660
With kids, nosebleeds are not that uncommon.

1492
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:43,120
Could be as simple as a change in climate and altitude from the trip.

1493
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,120
Did you find anything else?

1494
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,120
You mean like with you?

1495
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,120
No, nothing like that.

1496
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,120
He's going to be fine.

1497
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,120
Joe, relax.

1498
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,120
You'll have him back in the morning.

1499
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,120
Come here.

1500
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,120
No more secrets.

1501
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,120
Now we're going to go home and you're going to tell me everything.

1502
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:09,580
Right.

1503
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:10,580
Everything?

1504
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:14,580
Okay, let's go.

1505
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:20,580
I don't understand.

1506
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:22,580
Why did you keep this from me?

1507
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:27,580
I didn't want you to think I was crazy.

1508
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:32,580
Well, the first thing I'm going to do is I want to call the police.

1509
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:36,580
Joe, it's not going to do any good.

1510
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,040
Mary, don't tell me that.

1511
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,040
I mean, somebody takes you from this house and does God knows what to you

1512
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,040
and you tell me the police can't help?

1513
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:49,040
I told you what that psychiatrist in L.A. said.

1514
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,040
Mary, I love you.

1515
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,040
And you know that.

1516
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:01,040
And I'd do anything for you, but honey, please,

1517
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:05,040
please don't ask me to believe in little gray men.

1518
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,500
Something is happening to me.

1519
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:10,500
And something is happening to Timmy.

1520
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,500
And whoever is doing it is going to come back.

1521
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,500
I know it.

1522
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:38,500
So that's the fancy L.A. shrink, huh?

1523
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,500
He's here to help us, Joe.

1524
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,500
Oh, Mary.

1525
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:52,500
Mary.

1526
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,500
Thanks for coming.

1527
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,500
This is my husband, Joe.

1528
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,500
Joe?

1529
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,500
Yeah, glad you could make it.

1530
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:00,500
How is he?

1531
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,500
What do they want with him?

1532
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,960
He's just a little boy.

1533
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,960
Oh, honey.

1534
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,960
Lee, I've never seen a boy act this way.

1535
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,960
Here, let me get that.

1536
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,960
I mean, he won't talk.

1537
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,960
I know he's all right, but he won't even get up out of bed.

1538
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,960
Hey, Tim.

1539
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,960
Look who's here.

1540
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,960
It's Dr. Chase.

1541
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,960
Hi, slugger.

1542
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:33,420
How you feeling?

1543
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,420
I came all the way out here with Aunt Lee.

1544
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:37,420
Just to see you.

1545
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:43,420
Aren't you going to say hi?

1546
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:46,420
I heard you had a bad nosebleed the other night.

1547
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:48,420
How you feeling now?

1548
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,420
What's the matter, Timmy?

1549
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:55,420
What's wrong?

1550
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:58,420
You said they weren't real.

1551
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:03,420
What do you mean?

1552
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:05,420
You know what I mean.

1553
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:08,420
No, I'm afraid I don't know.

1554
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:11,420
Why don't you tell me?

1555
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,420
Ask her to tell you.

1556
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:14,420
Tim.

1557
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:16,420
No, I was calling you.

1558
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:18,420
I was yelling and yelling and you didn't even come.

1559
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:20,420
I know, baby, I tried, but I couldn't get in the door.

1560
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:22,420
They hurt me.

1561
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:24,420
Why didn't you stop them?

1562
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:26,420
They hurt me.

1563
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:28,420
I'm sorry, Tim.

1564
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:30,420
I'm so sorry.

1565
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,420
Well, I'm sorry, folks.

1566
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:36,420
But there's no way I'm buying this UFO business.

1567
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:38,420
Come on, Joe.

1568
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:40,420
Open your mind.

1569
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:42,420
People have spotted too many strange lights in the sky

1570
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:44,420
to just disregard it out of hand.

1571
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:46,420
Open my mind.

1572
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:48,420
Father, help me out here, would you?

1573
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:50,420
Would you tell the lovely young lady here

1574
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:53,420
how God and aliens just don't mix?

1575
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:55,420
Would you also tell her how there's no mention

1576
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:58,420
whatsoever of UFOs?

1577
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,880
In a good book, am I right?

1578
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,880
That's right.

1579
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,880
And I know you personally don't believe in such things.

1580
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,880
Don't be so sure, Joe.

1581
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,880
I believe there's a place in God's creation

1582
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,880
for an infinite number of things.

1583
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,880
The way I see it, the more fantastic the universe,

1584
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,880
the greater the glory of the God who created it all.

1585
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,880
Don't you agree, Dr. James?

1586
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:20,880
Oh, I'm sure the universe is quite fantastic, Father.

1587
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,880
But I'm also certain that when we get to the bottom of this,

1588
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,880
we're gonna find out it's an entirely terrestrial universe.

1589
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:30,340
Terrestrial mystery, dare you?

1590
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:32,340
Then how do you explain Mary

1591
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:34,340
and that other woman in L.A.?

1592
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:36,340
What other woman?

1593
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,340
I'm working with a patient

1594
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:42,340
who seems to have had a parallel experience.

1595
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:44,340
Oh.

1596
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,340
Really?

1597
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:48,340
Well, what does she say?

1598
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:50,340
Has she seen a little man?

1599
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:52,340
Has she seen their eyes?

1600
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:54,340
I'd rather not reveal too many details.

1601
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:56,340
I don't want either one of you influenced by the other.

1602
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,800
But we still have more work to do.

1603
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,800
I know.

1604
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,800
There's a lot I don't remember.

1605
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,800
Wow.

1606
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,800
Another hypnosis session would be helpful.

1607
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,800
I think we'll explore that in the morning.

1608
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,800
No.

1609
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,800
Tonight.

1610
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,800
Tonight.

1611
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,800
You know, I've been so alone with all of this.

1612
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,800
I want all of you to go through it with me.

1613
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,300
Relax, Mary.

1614
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,300
You're very, very relaxed.

1615
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:37,300
You're going to remember everything that happened.

1616
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:39,300
You're gonna see it clearly.

1617
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,300
Without fear.

1618
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,300
Without anxiety.

1619
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,300
When I count to three,

1620
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:51,300
I want you to go back to that first time

1621
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:53,300
that you saw these men.

1622
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,300
All right?

1623
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:58,260
One.

1624
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,260
Two.

1625
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:04,260
Three.

1626
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:10,260
It's hot.

1627
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:25,260
How old are you, Mary?

1628
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:28,220
Seven and a half.

1629
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:37,220
Where are you?

1630
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:39,220
In the backyard.

1631
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:42,220
What are you doing?

1632
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:48,220
Me and Lee are helping Daddy in the garden.

1633
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,220
Mary.

1634
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,220
Mary, look.

1635
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:21,220
Come on.

1636
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:28,220
Come on.

1637
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,220
Little boy, wait for us.

1638
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:48,220
Little boy, wait for us.

1639
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:58,220
Come on.

1640
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:20,220
Oh.

1641
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:22,220
Mary, what is it?

1642
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:24,220
What's happening?

1643
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:27,180
We're inside.

1644
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:33,180
In the hall.

1645
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:35,180
The little boy is gone.

1646
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:40,180
Two little ghosts are walking with us now.

1647
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:42,180
Oh.

1648
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:45,180
One of them is taking Lee away.

1649
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:49,180
Where are they taking her?

1650
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:54,180
These little ghosts, what color are they?

1651
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:57,180
Gray.

1652
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:03,180
What is it, Mary?

1653
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:05,180
Do you see something?

1654
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:07,180
There's...

1655
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:09,180
There's these little...

1656
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:12,180
There's funny letters.

1657
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:15,180
Something.

1658
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:17,180
On the wall.

1659
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:19,180
Well, you take a good look at them.

1660
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:23,180
Because later I'm going to want you to draw them for me.

1661
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:26,140
Oh.

1662
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:28,140
It's cold.

1663
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:30,140
What's cold?

1664
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:35,140
Table.

1665
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:48,140
You have been chosen

1666
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:51,140
as your mother before you.

1667
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:54,100
Your sister.

1668
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:56,100
Your child.

1669
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,100
We will be together

1670
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,100
many times.

1671
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:10,100
It hurts.

1672
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:13,100
Oh.

1673
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,100
Please.

1674
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,100
You're hurting me.

1675
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:23,100
Ah!

1676
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:25,100
Ah!

1677
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,100
You're hurting my leg.

1678
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:31,100
Please.

1679
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:33,100
Stop it.

1680
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,100
Stop it.

1681
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:37,100
I don't want to be here anymore.

1682
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,100
Mary, it's all right.

1683
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:42,100
You're not there. You're here.

1684
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,100
And no one can harm you here.

1685
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:48,100
No one can harm you.

1686
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:50,100
Now, when I count to three

1687
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:54,060
you can open your eyes and you will not be afraid.

1688
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:59,060
One.

1689
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:04,060
Two.

1690
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:06,060
Very slowly waking.

1691
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:11,060
Three.

1692
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:15,060
You're fully awake.

1693
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:23,060
You all right, Mary?

1694
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,060
Yeah.

1695
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:31,060
Do you remember a little boy like that ever?

1696
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:34,060
No.

1697
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:41,060
It was when they marked me.

1698
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:45,060
What do you mean they marked you?

1699
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:47,060
They marked me.

1700
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:50,020
See?

1701
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:55,020
See?

1702
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:58,020
How long have you had that?

1703
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:01,020
Since I was a kid.

1704
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:08,020
This has been happening all my life.

1705
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:10,980
What have they done to me?

1706
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:13,980
What are they going to do?

1707
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:27,980
I didn't think that rain was ever going to stop.

1708
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:30,980
I'm sorry.

1709
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:32,980
I'm sorry.

1710
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:34,980
I'm sorry.

1711
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:37,940
I didn't think that rain was ever going to stop.

1712
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:41,940
They're really coming down.

1713
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:48,940
What do you think now, Doc?

1714
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:52,940
I, uh...

1715
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:56,940
I haven't figured that out yet.

1716
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:03,940
Yeah, you know, I know you came out here to help my wife,

1717
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:07,900
but I think it's me that needs a little help now.

1718
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,900
I mean, that thing told her

1719
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:14,900
that she was chosen

1720
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:16,900
like her mother,

1721
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:20,900
like my son.

1722
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:24,900
And if they can just turn people off

1723
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,900
like they did to me

1724
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:28,900
the night Timmy was hurt,

1725
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:32,900
then how am I supposed to protect my family?

1726
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:36,900
I don't know.

1727
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:52,900
I didn't know you were an artist.

1728
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:56,900
Yeah, I wish.

1729
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,900
It's beautiful here.

1730
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:07,900
I can't stop thinking about last night, Neil.

1731
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,900
It scares me.

1732
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:15,900
That scar that Mary showed us?

1733
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:29,900
I've had it since I was a little girl, too.

1734
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:33,860
I've had it since I was a little girl, too.

1735
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:44,860
If things have happened to me,

1736
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:48,860
well, I'm glad I don't remember.

1737
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:52,860
I think it's a blessing.

1738
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:02,860
Joe!

1739
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:04,860
He's gone! They've taken him!

1740
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,860
What? Jimmy! He's gone!

1741
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:08,860
What's wrong?

1742
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:10,860
He's not in this room. He's not in the house.

1743
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:12,860
So there he is! In the field!

1744
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:14,860
Tim!

1745
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:16,860
Tim!

1746
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:18,860
What are you doing, honey?

1747
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:20,860
What are you doing?

1748
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:24,860
What in the world happened here?

1749
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:27,820
What in the world happened here?

1750
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,820
This is where it was.

1751
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:33,820
The night I saw the little men coming to get me,

1752
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:35,820
this is where the disc was.

1753
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:41,820
I feel like we're deserting them.

1754
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:44,820
It scares me to think what might happen after we leave.

1755
01:40:55,820 --> 01:40:57,820
There's just enough time.

1756
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:59,820
There's someone I want to stop and see.

1757
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:17,820
You want to know about that object we discovered,

1758
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:19,820
the telly.

1759
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:21,820
Yeah, that's right.

1760
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:23,820
Well, sir, I've...

1761
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,780
I've come across some odd things in my day.

1762
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:28,780
Yes, indeed.

1763
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:30,780
But I must admit,

1764
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:32,780
that thing I found in Mary's nose,

1765
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:34,780
I mean, that, that was strange.

1766
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:36,780
I, uh...

1767
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:38,780
I don't suppose you still have it.

1768
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:40,780
Well, my first instinct

1769
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:42,780
was to flush it down the toilet.

1770
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:44,780
I didn't see any point in hanging on to it.

1771
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:46,780
But then I had, uh,

1772
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:48,780
second thoughts and...

1773
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:52,780
Second thoughts are often the best,

1774
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:54,780
don't you think?

1775
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:02,780
I began with some simple tests

1776
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:04,780
using a scanning electron microscope

1777
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:06,780
to ascertain the structural form of the object.

1778
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:08,780
I discovered three minute

1779
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:10,780
but distinct lobes.

1780
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:12,780
The EDS revealed their chemical makeup

1781
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:14,780
is 90% carbon,

1782
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:16,780
10% oxygen.

1783
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:18,780
I'm dealing with a very advanced,

1784
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:20,780
highly conductive polymer,

1785
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:22,780
which I've never seen,

1786
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:24,780
so I decided to run a culture test

1787
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:26,780
to see if the pellet was a catalyst

1788
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:28,780
for germ viral growth.

1789
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:34,780
What is that?

1790
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:36,780
It seems that our object,

1791
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:38,780
under certain circumstances,

1792
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:40,780
goes from a dormant state

1793
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,780
to one of physical mutation.

1794
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:44,780
Quite extraordinary.

1795
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:46,780
It's as if it were trying to burrow

1796
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:48,780
into the sample dish.

1797
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:52,780
You said the pellet...

1798
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:54,780
mutates under certain circumstances.

1799
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:58,780
What are they?

1800
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:00,780
It alters in a moist environment

1801
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:02,780
at a precise 98.6 degrees.

1802
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:04,780
In my estimation,

1803
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:06,780
it's almost as if the device

1804
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:08,780
was designed to flourish

1805
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:10,780
inside the human body.

1806
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:12,780
But it's not.

1807
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:14,780
It's not.

1808
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:16,780
It's not.

1809
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:18,780
It's not.

1810
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:20,780
It's inside the human body.

1811
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,780
Will you still be needing it?

1812
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:26,780
Needing what?

1813
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:28,780
I'm sorry to say,

1814
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:30,780
there's nothing left.

1815
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:32,780
A little while after the last test,

1816
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:34,780
it disintegrated right before my eyes.

1817
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:36,780
I took it to be some sort of

1818
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:38,780
internal self-destruct mechanism.

1819
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:40,780
It's clever,

1820
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:42,780
ineffective,

1821
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:44,780
not a trace remains.

1822
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:50,780
Gene.

1823
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:14,780
Gene, do you remember

1824
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:16,780
what you told me about these?

1825
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:20,780
You said some people

1826
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:22,780
in the desert showed them to you.

1827
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:26,780
Can you tell me about the people?

1828
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:34,780
I can't tell you that, Doc.

1829
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:36,780
They say it would be better.

1830
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:44,780
Okay, then what about the desert?

1831
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:46,780
Hmm?

1832
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:48,780
Can we talk about that part?

1833
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:50,780
Yeah, yeah,

1834
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:52,780
I guess I can tell you about the desert.

1835
01:44:54,780 --> 01:44:56,780
I was stationed there.

1836
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:58,780
New Mexico,

1837
01:44:58,780 --> 01:45:00,780
73.

1838
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:04,780
Did anything happen in the desert?

1839
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:16,780
I can't...

1840
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:18,780
I can't stand

1841
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:20,780
to think about it.

1842
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:22,780
How come you keep bringing that up?

1843
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:30,780
You know you want to tell me, Gene.

1844
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:34,780
What happened?

1845
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:36,780
Yeah?

1846
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:40,780
Tell me what happened.

1847
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:42,780
Tell me what happened.

1848
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:54,780
You know, Doc,

1849
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:56,780
most mental cases

1850
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:58,780
can't pinpoint

1851
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:00,780
the moment they lost it.

1852
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:04,780
I can't.

1853
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:06,780
I can't.

1854
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:12,780
It all started one night

1855
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:14,780
about 3 o'clock in the morning

1856
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:16,780
when I was standing in the graveyard

1857
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:18,780
watching the back gate of the air base.

1858
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:36,780
Oh, yeah!

1859
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:06,780
Holliman Command, over.

1860
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:10,780
Holliman Comma...

1861
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:36,780
Ah!

1862
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:38,780
Ah!

1863
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:40,780
Ah!

1864
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:42,780
Ah!

1865
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:06,780
Holliman Command.

1866
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:08,780
Holliman Command, over.

1867
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:10,780
Aircraft down.

1868
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:12,780
Repeat, aircraft down.

1869
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:14,780
Northwest sector.

1870
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:16,780
Sector 41.

1871
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:18,780
En route to crash site, sir.

1872
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:20,780
Procedure echo.

1873
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:22,780
Delta echo.

1874
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:36,780
Delta echo.

1875
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:06,780
Delta echo.

1876
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:36,780
Delta echo.

1877
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:06,780
Ah, baby.

1878
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:10,780
Baby.

1879
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:12,780
Ah, baby.

1880
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:38,780
Uhh.

1881
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:52,780
What is it?

1882
01:51:56,780 --> 01:51:58,780
Careful, be careful!

1883
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:00,780
Watch your eyes!

1884
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:02,780
Come check this out!

1885
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:05,780
There is something wrong with the situation that's here.

1886
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:08,780
Nothing's going right.

1887
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:09,780
Hey!

1888
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:10,780
Hey!

1889
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:11,780
Hey!

1890
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:12,780
Hey!

1891
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:13,780
This one might still be alive.

1892
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:14,780
We can help him.

1893
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:15,780
Yeah, come on.

1894
01:52:15,780 --> 01:52:16,780
You're coming with us, buddy.

1895
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:17,780
Let's go.

1896
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:18,780
No, no.

1897
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:19,780
Let's go.

1898
01:52:19,780 --> 01:52:20,780
He might be alive.

1899
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:21,780
Aren't you going to help him, sir?

1900
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:22,780
We'll take care of that.

1901
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:23,780
Get him out of here.

1902
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:24,780
Someone's got to help him, sir.

1903
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:25,780
Oh, damn it.

1904
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:26,780
He's going to help those people.

1905
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:27,780
They need help.

1906
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:28,780
Leave it on them.

1907
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:29,780
They need to help.

1908
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:30,780
They need to help, sir.

1909
01:52:30,780 --> 01:52:31,780
Wait a minute.

1910
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:32,780
Wait a minute.

1911
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:33,780
Wait a minute.

1912
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:34,780
He's going to help those people.

1913
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:35,780
I ain't done nothing to those people.

1914
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:36,780
They down there.

1915
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:37,780
They need help.

1916
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:38,780
They need to help.

1917
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:39,780
Wait a minute.

1918
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:40,780
Wait a minute.

1919
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:41,780
Wait a minute.

1920
01:52:41,780 --> 01:53:00,780
They kept at me for three days until I signed that paper that said I was...

1921
01:53:01,780 --> 01:53:08,780
I was on something.

1922
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:13,780
Then they took me to the site.

1923
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:18,780
Wasn't anything there.

1924
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:21,780
Nothing.

1925
01:53:21,780 --> 01:53:27,780
And the piece of metal you took off the craft?

1926
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:31,780
The one with the symbols on it?

1927
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:32,780
No.

1928
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:37,780
No, I never saw it again.

1929
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:38,780
Maybe you're right.

1930
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:41,780
Maybe I was on something.

1931
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:45,780
Maybe I am crazy.

1932
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:48,780
No.

1933
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:51,780
No, you're not crazy, Gene.

1934
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:17,780
I do this?

1935
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:19,780
No.

1936
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:23,780
I was done by a woman in Nebraska.

1937
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:24,780
She's never met you.

1938
01:54:24,780 --> 01:54:27,780
She's never heard of you.

1939
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:32,780
She's never seen your symbols.

1940
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:36,780
She saw them inside a spaceship.

1941
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:56,780
It's all right, Gene.

1942
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:58,780
It's all right.

1943
01:54:58,780 --> 01:55:00,780
It's all right.

1944
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:08,780
Come in, Neil.

1945
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:20,780
Sit down, doctor.

1946
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:24,780
Hold all calls, please.

1947
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:30,780
You're becoming involved with some questionable things, Neil.

1948
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:34,780
What exactly are you referring to, Stanley?

1949
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:39,780
This, um, lunatic fringe you're associating with.

1950
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:42,780
It's unbecoming a man of your position.

1951
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:47,780
I'm trying to find out what you're talking about.

1952
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:51,780
I'm trying to help people.

1953
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:54,780
I'm sure you're well-intentioned,

1954
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:58,780
but word is already starting to get around.

1955
01:55:58,780 --> 01:56:01,780
Just what the hell is that supposed to mean?

1956
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:02,780
Talk.

1957
01:56:02,780 --> 01:56:03,780
Talk.

1958
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:07,780
In professional circles, our circles,

1959
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:14,780
it's very embarrassing to have one of your own look so ridiculous.

1960
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:19,780
Get out now, Neil, for your own good.

1961
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:21,780
You know, I'll tell you something, doctor.

1962
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:25,780
I am getting damn sick of all this sudden good advice.

1963
01:56:25,780 --> 01:56:27,780
Who else are you talking to?

1964
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:30,780
I'm just telling you as a friend.

1965
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:32,780
I'm doing you a favor.

1966
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:35,780
I will keep your favors, doctor.

1967
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:39,780
And don't kid yourself, we have never been friends.

1968
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:41,780
Fine.

1969
01:56:41,780 --> 01:56:44,780
I'm ordering you to drop any and all discussions

1970
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:45,780
of these so-called abductions.

1971
01:56:45,780 --> 01:56:46,780
Is that clear?

1972
01:56:46,780 --> 01:56:48,780
You have enough on your plate without complicating things.

1973
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:51,780
I am well aware of my responsibilities.

1974
01:56:51,780 --> 01:56:53,780
I hope so, Neil.

1975
01:56:53,780 --> 01:56:58,780
And one other thing, that patient of yours, Gene Randall,

1976
01:56:58,780 --> 01:57:01,780
is being released today.

1977
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:03,780
That'll be all, doctor.

1978
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:12,780
Thank you.

1979
01:57:28,780 --> 01:57:29,780
Ah, come in.

1980
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:30,780
Leslie, how are you?

1981
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:31,780
I'm good.

1982
01:57:31,780 --> 01:57:32,780
Great.

1983
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:33,780
Hey.

1984
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:34,780
Oh, here.

1985
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:36,780
Well, thank you very much.

1986
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:38,780
Leslie, you look great.

1987
01:57:38,780 --> 01:57:40,780
Must be that glow they talk about.

1988
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:42,780
So how was Kansas?

1989
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:43,780
Nebraska.

1990
01:57:43,780 --> 01:57:44,780
Isn't that the same thing?

1991
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:46,780
Only the Californians.

1992
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:48,780
Hi, Lee Holland.

1993
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:50,780
Sports night final.

1994
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:51,780
Right.

1995
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:52,780
I don't know.

1996
01:57:52,780 --> 01:57:53,780
All the men seem to know me.

1997
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:55,780
The women haven't a clue.

1998
01:57:55,780 --> 01:57:57,780
Come on in.

1999
01:57:57,780 --> 01:57:58,780
Hey.

2000
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:01,780
Hello.

2001
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:02,780
Oh, yeah.

2002
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:03,780
Are you kidding?

2003
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:06,780
Leslie, there's something you should know.

2004
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:09,780
I went to Nebraska to help a woman who's

2005
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:14,780
had some incidents strikingly similar to your own.

2006
01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:17,780
I think it's important for you to realize that you're not alone.

2007
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:23,780
Dr. Chase, I've changed my mind about those incidents.

2008
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:24,780
Oh?

2009
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:25,780
Yes.

2010
01:58:25,780 --> 01:58:26,780
Yes.

2011
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:28,780
I think you were right all along.

2012
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:30,780
I think they were dreams.

2013
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:34,780
Anyway, that's all in the past now.

2014
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:36,780
I can feel it.

2015
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:38,780
I'm sure of it.

2016
01:58:38,780 --> 01:58:40,780
We're getting married.

2017
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:41,780
Oh, that's wonderful.

2018
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:42,780
Congratulations.

2019
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:44,780
Thank you.

2020
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:46,780
It's hard to describe it.

2021
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:50,780
This baby has brought focus into my life.

2022
01:58:50,780 --> 01:58:53,780
It brought Ray and I together.

2023
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:56,780
It's like it was a gift from God.

2024
01:58:56,780 --> 01:58:57,780
Have you set a date?

2025
01:58:57,780 --> 01:58:58,780
No.

2026
01:58:58,780 --> 01:58:59,780
No, not yet.

2027
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:01,780
But we're planning on doing it before the baby comes

2028
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:03,780
to make it more proper, you know.

2029
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:05,780
But as soon as we set a date, you'll be the first to know.

2030
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:06,780
I promise.

2031
01:59:06,780 --> 01:59:11,780
Well, here's to the happy couple and to the beautiful child-to-be.

2032
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:12,780
Thank you.

2033
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:13,780
Happy.

2034
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:17,780
Cheers.

2035
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:37,780
No.

2036
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:04,780
No.

2037
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:05,780
Please.

2038
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:37,780
Oh, where are we?

2039
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:41,780
What is this place?

2040
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:45,780
Ray?

2041
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:49,780
Where are you taking me?

2042
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:52,780
No!

2043
02:01:04,780 --> 02:01:06,780
No.

2044
02:01:34,780 --> 02:01:35,780
No.

2045
02:01:57,780 --> 02:01:58,780
Flash?

2046
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:06,780
Leslie?

2047
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:15,780
Leslie?

2048
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:18,780
Leslie, you in there?

2049
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:21,780
Paul!

2050
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:24,780
My brain?

2051
02:02:25,780 --> 02:02:26,780
Oh, baby.

2052
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:29,780
Something's wrong.

2053
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:35,780
Dr. Chase?

2054
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:37,780
Thank you for coming.

2055
02:02:37,780 --> 02:02:38,780
I'm Susan Goodburn.

2056
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:39,780
No, doctor.

2057
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:40,780
How is she?

2058
02:02:40,780 --> 02:02:41,780
They've given her a sedative.

2059
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:43,780
She's resting more comfortably.

2060
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:46,780
Emotionally, however, she's still quite distraught.

2061
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:48,780
And the baby?

2062
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:52,780
What happened?

2063
02:02:52,780 --> 02:02:53,780
We're not sure.

2064
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:55,780
Everything was there.

2065
02:02:55,780 --> 02:02:59,780
The placenta, the umbilical cord, the embryonic sac.

2066
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:01,780
But the fetus is gone.

2067
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:07,780
I think she must have spontaneously aborted last night.

2068
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:11,780
Fleshed the fetus and then blocked the memory.

2069
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:13,780
But that's more your field, doctor.

2070
02:03:13,780 --> 02:03:14,780
Does your boyfriend do?

2071
02:03:14,780 --> 02:03:15,780
Had to go back on duty.

2072
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:17,780
Said he'd be here the minute he's off.

2073
02:03:17,780 --> 02:03:20,780
In the meantime, she keeps asking for you.

2074
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:32,780
Leslie.

2075
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:34,780
I'm sorry.

2076
02:03:35,780 --> 02:03:37,780
They did it, Dr. Chase.

2077
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:39,780
They did it.

2078
02:03:41,780 --> 02:03:43,780
They took my baby, do you understand?

2079
02:03:45,780 --> 02:03:48,780
They went inside me and took my baby.

2080
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:52,780
It's not fair.

2081
02:03:54,780 --> 02:03:56,780
It was mine.

2082
02:03:57,780 --> 02:03:59,780
I hate them.

2083
02:04:00,780 --> 02:04:02,780
I hate them.

2084
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:17,780
Well, well, well.

2085
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:19,780
College professor.

2086
02:04:20,780 --> 02:04:21,780
You could have fooled me.

2087
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:23,780
What do you think I was?

2088
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:24,780
A lion tamer?

2089
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:28,780
Well, based on your last exit, maybe an acrobat.

2090
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:31,780
I didn't teach anyway.

2091
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:33,780
Anthropology.

2092
02:04:34,780 --> 02:04:35,780
You want to enroll?

2093
02:04:36,780 --> 02:04:39,780
Actually, I came by to return a favor.

2094
02:04:41,780 --> 02:04:42,780
Cajun.

2095
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:48,780
It's hard to tell just what they are.

2096
02:04:49,780 --> 02:04:53,780
Everyone thinks out of space because we call them aliens.

2097
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:55,780
Who knows where they really come from?

2098
02:04:55,780 --> 02:05:02,780
One thing I do know is that I'm sure they have no intention of landing on the White House lawn or appearing on Nightline.

2099
02:05:03,780 --> 02:05:05,780
Okay, forget what they are.

2100
02:05:06,780 --> 02:05:08,780
Where are they from? What do they want?

2101
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:13,780
Ask a hundred different experts and get a hundred and ten different replies.

2102
02:05:14,780 --> 02:05:15,780
Exploration.

2103
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:16,780
Curiosity.

2104
02:05:17,780 --> 02:05:18,780
Salvation.

2105
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:19,780
Spinner will.

2106
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:20,780
Take your choice.

2107
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:24,780
Come with you for answers. I ought to have my head examined.

2108
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:27,780
If you want answers, Doc, come to my meeting tomorrow night.

2109
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:30,780
Meet the real experts, abductees.

2110
02:05:35,780 --> 02:05:36,780
All right.

2111
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:39,780
I have a couple of people I want to bring with me.

2112
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:40,780
The more, the merrier.

2113
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:43,780
Good to see you again, Doc.

2114
02:05:44,780 --> 02:05:47,780
I knew you'd be back, but not quite so soon.

2115
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:50,780
What turned you around?

2116
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:53,780
You finally opened my eyes.

2117
02:05:56,780 --> 02:05:58,780
I'm Dan Blatt. I'm a golf pro.

2118
02:06:02,780 --> 02:06:07,780
For years I worked real hard at suppressing all abduction memories.

2119
02:06:08,780 --> 02:06:12,780
Now that I remember, I'm scared to death almost all the time.

2120
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:16,780
I know they'll be coming for me again.

2121
02:06:16,780 --> 02:06:17,780
They always come back.

2122
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:22,780
My name is Ruth Kennedy.

2123
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:24,780
I'm a housewife.

2124
02:06:25,780 --> 02:06:27,780
And I don't think we should be afraid of them.

2125
02:06:29,780 --> 02:06:33,780
I feel like the initial fear is on our side.

2126
02:06:34,780 --> 02:06:36,780
An all too human fear of the unknown.

2127
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:41,780
My name is Margaret Hussey.

2128
02:06:42,780 --> 02:06:43,780
I'm a stockbroker.

2129
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:45,780
I feel fortunate that they selected me.

2130
02:06:47,780 --> 02:06:49,780
I think we're all really lucky.

2131
02:06:50,780 --> 02:06:51,780
Special.

2132
02:06:53,780 --> 02:06:55,780
We've been chosen for a higher purpose.

2133
02:06:55,780 --> 02:06:58,780
We should be proud of being marked in this way.

2134
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:02,780
Javier Perez.

2135
02:07:03,780 --> 02:07:04,780
I'm a foreman.

2136
02:07:06,780 --> 02:07:08,780
We're laboratory rats.

2137
02:07:08,780 --> 02:07:09,780
I'm a foreman.

2138
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:13,780
We're laboratory rats.

2139
02:07:14,780 --> 02:07:15,780
That's all.

2140
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:17,780
Specimens.

2141
02:07:18,780 --> 02:07:21,780
They've been manipulating my life since I was a little boy.

2142
02:07:23,780 --> 02:07:24,780
And they never asked permission.

2143
02:07:26,780 --> 02:07:27,780
They never once asked.

2144
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:29,780
You know what the hardest part is?

2145
02:07:31,780 --> 02:07:32,780
The isolation.

2146
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:34,780
The ridicule.

2147
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:36,780
The self-doubt.

2148
02:07:37,780 --> 02:07:39,780
Half the time you're wondering if you're going crazy.

2149
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:44,780
Half the time everyone else thinks that you are.

2150
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:50,780
How many of you were children when you were first abducted?

2151
02:07:57,780 --> 02:07:59,780
You see, that's how it usually starts.

2152
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:01,780
For most of them.

2153
02:08:02,780 --> 02:08:06,780
Well, I asked Leslie and Ray to come with me tonight because...

2154
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:12,780
I thought the people in this group more than anyone else in the world would understand how they feel.

2155
02:08:13,780 --> 02:08:15,780
You can talk to us, Leslie.

2156
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:18,780
We've all had to deal with a lot of pain.

2157
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:26,780
I hate them.

2158
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:27,780
I hate them.

2159
02:08:30,780 --> 02:08:33,780
They just come and take whatever they want.

2160
02:08:35,780 --> 02:08:37,780
What doesn't belong to them.

2161
02:08:41,780 --> 02:08:43,780
They took my baby.

2162
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:44,780
Leslie.

2163
02:08:55,780 --> 02:08:57,780
They took my baby, too.

2164
02:08:59,780 --> 02:09:01,780
That happened to my wife, too.

2165
02:09:06,780 --> 02:09:07,780
She blamed herself.

2166
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:11,780
Nothing I could say could change that.

2167
02:09:12,780 --> 02:09:14,780
There was nothing I could do.

2168
02:09:15,780 --> 02:09:17,780
But there is something that we can do.

2169
02:09:19,780 --> 02:09:23,780
I can try to help you deal with the trauma of what you've experienced.

2170
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:31,780
Integrate it into your lives so you don't live with these feelings of guilt and fear.

2171
02:09:32,780 --> 02:09:33,780
Yes, but...

2172
02:09:36,780 --> 02:09:38,780
How do we stop it from happening again?

2173
02:09:42,780 --> 02:09:44,780
How do we stop it?

2174
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:56,780
Excuse me. Can I ask you...

2175
02:09:57,780 --> 02:09:58,780
Oh, is that you, Margaret?

2176
02:09:58,780 --> 02:09:59,780
Yeah, yeah, Margaret has...

2177
02:09:59,780 --> 02:10:00,780
Ray Brooks.

2178
02:10:00,780 --> 02:10:01,780
Nice to meet you.

2179
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:02,780
You, too.

2180
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:07,780
I feel a lot better about Ray and Leslie.

2181
02:10:07,780 --> 02:10:09,780
This group's going to be very helpful.

2182
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:12,780
I'm glad you changed your mind about us, Neil. These people need you.

2183
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:14,780
I'll be here every other Tuesday.

2184
02:10:14,780 --> 02:10:17,780
I hear you'll be addressing an SBA conference tomorrow.

2185
02:10:18,780 --> 02:10:20,780
How'd you know that?

2186
02:10:20,780 --> 02:10:23,780
One of my colleagues from the university will be there.

2187
02:10:24,780 --> 02:10:26,780
What will you be talking about?

2188
02:10:26,780 --> 02:10:28,780
I know what I'd like to be talking about.

2189
02:10:28,780 --> 02:10:29,780
Why don't you?

2190
02:10:30,780 --> 02:10:32,780
You'd be trailblazing, Neil.

2191
02:10:32,780 --> 02:10:36,780
No one in your position has ever had the guts to speak out.

2192
02:10:36,780 --> 02:10:38,780
It's a unique opportunity.

2193
02:10:40,780 --> 02:10:44,780
People who come forth with new ideas are often called crackpots, or worse.

2194
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:47,780
Then one day, the world catches up.

2195
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:50,780
Then they're called visionaries.

2196
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:53,780
Think about it.

2197
02:10:57,780 --> 02:10:58,780
Good night.

2198
02:10:58,780 --> 02:10:59,780
Good night.

2199
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:00,780
Good night.

2200
02:11:06,780 --> 02:11:10,780
Our final speaker tonight is someone very close to me,

2201
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:14,780
a highly respected colleague at the medical center for two years,

2202
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:16,780
and a dear, dear friend.

2203
02:11:16,780 --> 02:11:20,780
A man whose paper on post-traumatic stress syndrome

2204
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:23,780
is must-reading in the whole community.

2205
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:30,780
His subject tonight is the aftermath in adult life of childhood sexual abuse.

2206
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:33,780
Please welcome Dr. Neil Chase.

2207
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:42,780
Thank you. Thank you very much.

2208
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:46,780
It's nice to be here tonight and to see so many familiar faces.

2209
02:11:46,780 --> 02:11:48,780
Ladies and gentlemen,

2210
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:53,780
the treatment of adults who've experienced sexual child abuse

2211
02:11:53,780 --> 02:11:58,780
is often buried so deeply in the unconscious

2212
02:11:58,780 --> 02:12:04,780
that a patient will vehemently deny that it ever took place.

2213
02:12:17,780 --> 02:12:21,780
Regressive hypnosis is frequently a helpful tool

2214
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:24,780
when trying to recover a buried trauma.

2215
02:12:35,780 --> 02:12:40,780
The post-traumatic stress related to these events can manifest itself.

2216
02:12:47,780 --> 02:12:50,780
Ladies and gentlemen, with your indulgence,

2217
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:54,780
I would like to shift gears

2218
02:12:54,780 --> 02:12:59,780
and talk about something I have just recently become involved in.

2219
02:13:02,780 --> 02:13:05,780
There are difficulties in broaching the subject.

2220
02:13:07,780 --> 02:13:13,780
I can't think of a way that doesn't sound as if I'm making a plea for open-mindedness.

2221
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:22,780
It began one night not so long ago

2222
02:13:22,780 --> 02:13:26,780
when I did a favor for an associate of mine

2223
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:29,780
and I took on a new patient.

2224
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:35,780
These people can't be dismissed.

2225
02:13:35,780 --> 02:13:40,780
They can't be forced into one of our standard psychiatric categories.

2226
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:43,780
Their dilemmas are unique and challenging

2227
02:13:43,780 --> 02:13:46,780
and they desperately need our help.

2228
02:13:46,780 --> 02:13:49,780
I'm asking you to open your minds.

2229
02:13:49,780 --> 02:13:52,780
Don't be afraid to believe.

2230
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:58,780
This is the most significant development in the history of man.

2231
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:04,780
Tell us something, Dr. Chase, if this is happening, why haven't we heard anything about it?

2232
02:14:04,780 --> 02:14:07,780
I mean, where's the government in all this, the space people?

2233
02:14:07,780 --> 02:14:10,780
Are you saying that this is going on and they don't know about it?

2234
02:14:10,780 --> 02:14:13,780
No, believe me, they know about it.

2235
02:14:13,780 --> 02:14:17,780
Do some research. These things have actually shown up on radar.

2236
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:19,780
Then why are they keeping it a secret?

2237
02:14:19,780 --> 02:14:22,780
I don't know. There are a number of theories about that.

2238
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:24,780
And what do they want?

2239
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:29,780
I'm sorry, I have heard no explanations for any of these things here this evening.

2240
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:31,780
Because there aren't any explanations.

2241
02:14:31,780 --> 02:14:33,780
Oh, God.

2242
02:14:33,780 --> 02:14:36,780
I've been practicing psychiatry for almost 20 years.

2243
02:14:37,780 --> 02:14:42,780
All my training, my instincts, my clinical experience

2244
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:48,780
led me in search of an acceptable psychological explanation for what I was hearing.

2245
02:14:49,780 --> 02:14:52,780
My biggest fear was that I wouldn't find one.

2246
02:14:54,780 --> 02:14:56,780
And I didn't.

2247
02:14:57,780 --> 02:15:01,780
But ladies and gentlemen, there is no denying what I've seen.

2248
02:15:02,780 --> 02:15:06,780
What's happening is real.

2249
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:14,780
You have committed professional suicide. You know that, don't you?

2250
02:15:14,780 --> 02:15:16,780
No one will ever take you seriously again.

2251
02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:21,780
Your name will always be associated with that laughable misguided spectacle that you put on last night.

2252
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:23,780
What's your point, doctor?

2253
02:15:23,780 --> 02:15:28,780
You have embarrassed the good name of our hospital as well as myself professionally.

2254
02:15:28,780 --> 02:15:32,780
As soon as I can prepare the papers, I am going to petition the board to seek...

2255
02:15:32,780 --> 02:15:34,780
Don't bother, I resign.

2256
02:15:34,780 --> 02:15:36,780
It hasn't been a pleasure, doctor.

2257
02:15:59,780 --> 02:16:01,780
I'm Dr. Neil Chase.

2258
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:03,780
Yes, sir. Would you follow me, please?

2259
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:21,780
I'm General Hanley. Thank you for coming.

2260
02:16:21,780 --> 02:16:23,780
Do you care for a drink?

2261
02:16:23,780 --> 02:16:25,780
No, thank you.

2262
02:16:25,780 --> 02:16:28,780
All right, Maurice, would you close the door on your way out, please?

2263
02:16:29,780 --> 02:16:31,780
Have a seat, doctor.

2264
02:16:34,780 --> 02:16:41,780
I've been reading the transcript of your recent remarks to the State Psychiatric Association.

2265
02:16:41,780 --> 02:16:44,780
I hear they cause quite a stir.

2266
02:16:44,780 --> 02:16:50,780
But we don't concern ourselves with these screwball flying saucer stories

2267
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:55,780
that headline in the supermarket tabloids.

2268
02:16:55,780 --> 02:16:58,780
As a matter of fact, we'd rather encourage them.

2269
02:16:58,780 --> 02:17:03,780
But when someone like yourself gets involved, then we become quite concerned.

2270
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:05,780
And why's that?

2271
02:17:05,780 --> 02:17:09,780
Your credentials, doctor. You're standing in the psychiatric community.

2272
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:16,780
From you, something like this cannot be so easily discredited.

2273
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:18,780
Why would you want to discredit it?

2274
02:17:19,780 --> 02:17:25,780
Let me tell you a story, entirely hypothetical, of course.

2275
02:17:25,780 --> 02:17:35,780
Let's suppose that a group was formed many years ago to investigate a certain worrisome phenomenon.

2276
02:17:35,780 --> 02:17:44,780
And let's suppose that the many brilliant men in this group could be counted on to come up with answers to such a mystery

2277
02:17:44,780 --> 02:17:48,780
and could be counted on to keep their mouths shut until they did come up with answers.

2278
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:53,780
Were you one of these men, General?

2279
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:58,780
Most of those men would be dead now.

2280
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:01,780
As I said, it was a long time ago.

2281
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:09,780
The problem was that the men in this group couldn't find an answer.

2282
02:18:09,780 --> 02:18:11,780
Oh, they knew there was something out there, all right.

2283
02:18:11,780 --> 02:18:13,780
There's no doubt about that.

2284
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:16,780
Something quite extraordinary.

2285
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:22,780
But as to the who, why, what, where, well, they struck out.

2286
02:18:22,780 --> 02:18:24,780
They struck out good.

2287
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:27,780
Would you like a cigar, doctor?

2288
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:29,780
No, thanks.

2289
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:39,780
So, the president who had formed this group made a decision to hide its existence,

2290
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:46,780
make it an ongoing black project, untraceable, unaccountable to Congress,

2291
02:18:46,780 --> 02:18:49,780
or even to succeeding administrations.

2292
02:18:49,780 --> 02:18:55,780
And then, on the day that answers finally were found,

2293
02:18:55,780 --> 02:19:00,780
the group leader was to march into the Oval Office and inform the president.

2294
02:19:00,780 --> 02:19:02,780
That day is yet to come.

2295
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:08,780
That's a very interesting story, General.

2296
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:13,780
But no group, no government, no single person, not even the president,

2297
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:17,780
has the right to make that kind of unilateral decision.

2298
02:19:17,780 --> 02:19:19,780
All right.

2299
02:19:19,780 --> 02:19:21,780
All right, doctor.

2300
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:28,780
Let's assume, for the sake of the argument again, that something is happening out there.

2301
02:19:28,780 --> 02:19:31,780
What would you have us do?

2302
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:35,780
Should the president of the United States go on national television and say,

2303
02:19:35,780 --> 02:19:41,780
my fellow Americans, we have evidence of a superior culture out there.

2304
02:19:41,780 --> 02:19:48,780
They come from God knows where, maybe from outer space,

2305
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:52,780
maybe from some other dimension of existence.

2306
02:19:52,780 --> 02:20:00,780
They are abducting our citizens on a regular basis, conducting experiments on them,

2307
02:20:00,780 --> 02:20:05,780
collecting specimens of our ova, our sperm.

2308
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:12,780
They have been impregnating women and then later invading those women's bodies again

2309
02:20:12,780 --> 02:20:20,780
and stealing the unborn fetuses for reasons we can only imagine.

2310
02:20:20,780 --> 02:20:28,780
Well, our world, my friend, is based on the premise of a 30-year mortgage.

2311
02:20:28,780 --> 02:20:32,780
You and I can close our eyes and go to sleep at night

2312
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:36,780
because we're pretty sure that the world we know today will be there tomorrow

2313
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:40,780
and the next day and the week after that.

2314
02:20:40,780 --> 02:20:46,780
So I repeat, doctor, until the day comes when we know what we're dealing with,

2315
02:20:46,780 --> 02:20:53,780
until we can give solid answers, the policy of this government remains, nothing is out there.

2316
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:59,780
It's just science fiction, the domain of a very rabid lunatic fringe.

2317
02:21:04,780 --> 02:21:07,780
What's the point of this meeting, General?

2318
02:21:07,780 --> 02:21:11,780
We want you to join us, help us find the answers.

2319
02:21:11,780 --> 02:21:15,780
We need people like you in this group.

2320
02:21:15,780 --> 02:21:21,780
Now, doctor, they would be willing to make you an excellent arrangement

2321
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:26,780
and they will let you inside the door and show you things

2322
02:21:26,780 --> 02:21:30,780
that will amaze you beyond your wildest dreams.

2323
02:21:32,780 --> 02:21:35,780
Not if it means sticking with the party line.

2324
02:21:35,780 --> 02:21:38,780
That's what it would mean.

2325
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:44,780
I'm sorry, General. I can't help you.

2326
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:49,780
Now, unless there's anything else.

2327
02:21:51,780 --> 02:21:54,780
You're being very foolish, sir.

2328
02:21:54,780 --> 02:21:59,780
Perhaps, but that's the way I feel about it.

2329
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:02,780
Thank you, General.

2330
02:22:04,780 --> 02:22:12,780
Dr. Chase, I'm afraid you're going to be a very lonely man.

2331
02:22:12,780 --> 02:22:17,780
But you've already found that out, haven't you?

2332
02:22:43,780 --> 02:22:46,780
Oh, Paul, thanks.

2333
02:22:50,780 --> 02:22:52,780
I got a call from Mary last night.

2334
02:22:52,780 --> 02:22:54,780
She wanted to know what we're doing for Thanksgiving.

2335
02:22:54,780 --> 02:22:56,780
They want us to come out.

2336
02:22:56,780 --> 02:23:00,780
Well, did something happen?

2337
02:23:00,780 --> 02:23:02,780
I don't know. She says things are a lot better,

2338
02:23:02,780 --> 02:23:05,780
but I'm not sure I believe her.

2339
02:23:06,780 --> 02:23:09,780
Do you want to go?

2340
02:23:10,780 --> 02:23:13,780
Yeah, sure.

2341
02:23:20,780 --> 02:23:22,780
What are you thinking?

2342
02:23:22,780 --> 02:23:25,780
I still can't help but think if I hadn't brought Mary to you that...

2343
02:23:25,780 --> 02:23:29,780
You still don't understand, do you?

2344
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:33,780
I'm glad you came to me.

2345
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:37,780
But, Neil, your reputation...

2346
02:23:38,780 --> 02:23:42,780
What the hell was my reputation?

2347
02:23:50,780 --> 02:23:54,780
Wow! Hey, that's some fastball you got there.

2348
02:23:54,780 --> 02:23:57,780
Do you throw with the seams or across?

2349
02:23:57,780 --> 02:23:59,780
With, I think.

2350
02:23:59,780 --> 02:24:01,780
Well, next time put two fingers across the seams.

2351
02:24:01,780 --> 02:24:03,780
That way you get more movement with the ball, all right?

2352
02:24:03,780 --> 02:24:05,780
Here we go, right down the middle, baby.

2353
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:07,780
Yeah!

2354
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:11,780
See you right three!

2355
02:24:16,780 --> 02:24:20,780
Oh, Mary, that looks delicious.

2356
02:24:21,780 --> 02:24:23,780
So do you love him?

2357
02:24:23,780 --> 02:24:25,780
What?

2358
02:24:25,780 --> 02:24:29,780
Because he's in love with you. It's as plain as day.

2359
02:24:29,780 --> 02:24:33,780
Yeah, I like him a lot, but we both agree to take it slow.

2360
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:36,780
Uh-huh, right.

2361
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:42,780
Okay, y'all, it's dinner!

2362
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:49,780
Dear Lord, we give thanks today for our family and friends and this fine meal.

2363
02:24:49,780 --> 02:24:53,780
And, Lord, I pray that you'll watch over my family...

2364
02:24:53,780 --> 02:24:57,780
and protect them and keep them from all harm.

2365
02:24:57,780 --> 02:25:01,780
We're giving our trust to you, Lord. Amen.

2366
02:25:01,780 --> 02:25:03,780
Amen.

2367
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:06,780
Well, I've got mine with y'all.

2368
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:09,780
Well, I'm willing to share, Joe.

2369
02:25:10,780 --> 02:25:12,780
How's it been going, Joe?

2370
02:25:12,780 --> 02:25:16,780
Oh, I don't know, Doc. All right, I guess.

2371
02:25:17,780 --> 02:25:19,780
Nothing's happened, has it?

2372
02:25:19,780 --> 02:25:21,780
No, no, not since she left.

2373
02:25:21,780 --> 02:25:25,780
I've been keeping a good watch on things, staying up all night sometimes.

2374
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:27,780
And I will tell you this.

2375
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:31,780
If they do decide to come back, I'm gonna be ready for them this time.

2376
02:25:31,780 --> 02:25:33,780
Day or night, it don't matter.

2377
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:38,780
They try to mess with my family again, and by God, they're gonna go through me first.

2378
02:25:41,780 --> 02:25:46,780
Joe, Lee tells me that Mary had a miscarriage about four years ago.

2379
02:25:49,780 --> 02:25:51,780
Yeah, yes, she did.

2380
02:25:53,780 --> 02:25:55,780
What happened?

2381
02:25:57,780 --> 02:26:00,780
Well, Doc, it's not the easiest thing to talk about.

2382
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:02,780
It almost split us up.

2383
02:26:04,780 --> 02:26:08,780
You know she had a booze problem at one time?

2384
02:26:08,780 --> 02:26:10,780
Yeah.

2385
02:26:10,780 --> 02:26:14,780
Oh, well, I was away on a trucking run when it happened.

2386
02:26:14,780 --> 02:26:19,780
Doc Holt figured she must've tied one on and...

2387
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:23,780
I don't know, fell down or something.

2388
02:26:23,780 --> 02:26:27,780
Anyway, she lost the baby, and that's when she quit drinking.

2389
02:26:33,780 --> 02:26:35,780
And there it is.

2390
02:26:40,780 --> 02:26:43,780
We had a light snow about a week ago.

2391
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:48,780
Stuff just evaporated right off.

2392
02:27:23,780 --> 02:27:25,780
Oh, my God.

2393
02:27:53,780 --> 02:27:56,780
Time has come, Mary.

2394
02:27:57,780 --> 02:28:01,780
Time has come for you to understand.

2395
02:28:53,780 --> 02:29:20,780
These are of the between, not of your world or of ours, but the between.

2396
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:25,780
Oh, my God.

2397
02:29:25,780 --> 02:29:27,780
Oh, my God.

2398
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:29,780
Oh, my God.

2399
02:29:29,780 --> 02:29:31,780
Oh, my God.

2400
02:29:31,780 --> 02:29:33,780
Oh, my God.

2401
02:30:01,780 --> 02:30:05,780
She's mine.

2402
02:30:05,780 --> 02:30:07,780
Isn't she?

2403
02:30:11,780 --> 02:30:13,780
Go.

2404
02:30:13,780 --> 02:30:15,780
Go.

2405
02:30:15,780 --> 02:30:17,780
Go.

2406
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:19,780
Go.

2407
02:30:19,780 --> 02:30:21,780
Go.

2408
02:30:21,780 --> 02:30:23,780
Go.

2409
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:25,780
Go.

2410
02:30:25,780 --> 02:30:27,780
Go.

2411
02:30:27,780 --> 02:30:29,780
Go.

2412
02:30:29,780 --> 02:30:36,780
Oh, she's so beautiful.

2413
02:30:43,780 --> 02:30:45,780
She looks like a little angel.

2414
02:30:52,780 --> 02:30:54,780
I want to hold her.

2415
02:30:59,780 --> 02:31:01,780
She's afraid of me.

2416
02:31:01,780 --> 02:31:03,780
She must go now.

2417
02:31:04,780 --> 02:31:06,780
No, why?

2418
02:31:06,780 --> 02:31:10,780
Oh, please, I have to hold her just for a moment.

2419
02:31:10,780 --> 02:31:12,780
I have to...

2420
02:31:12,780 --> 02:31:14,780
She's mine.

2421
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:16,780
No.

2422
02:31:28,780 --> 02:31:30,780
Don't be afraid of me.

2423
02:31:32,780 --> 02:31:34,780
I would never harm you.

2424
02:31:34,780 --> 02:31:36,780
Never.

2425
02:31:45,780 --> 02:31:47,780
I'm your mother.

2426
02:31:49,780 --> 02:31:51,780
I love you.

2427
02:31:56,780 --> 02:31:58,780
I'm your mother and I love you.

2428
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:02,780
Oh, I love you.

2429
02:32:05,780 --> 02:32:07,780
I just love you.

2430
02:32:07,780 --> 02:32:09,780
I love you.

2431
02:32:13,780 --> 02:32:15,780
I love you.

2432
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:17,780
No, no, please.

2433
02:32:17,780 --> 02:32:19,780
Please.

2434
02:32:19,780 --> 02:32:21,780
Can she stay? Can she stay with me?

2435
02:32:21,780 --> 02:32:23,780
It cannot be.

2436
02:32:23,780 --> 02:32:25,780
She could not live,

2437
02:32:25,780 --> 02:32:27,780
survive,

2438
02:32:27,780 --> 02:32:29,780
in your world.

2439
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:35,780
Oh, no.

2440
02:32:37,780 --> 02:32:39,780
No.

2441
02:33:07,780 --> 02:33:09,780
You must go back now.

2442
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:19,780
Will...

2443
02:33:21,780 --> 02:33:23,780
Will I ever see her again?

2444
02:33:25,780 --> 02:33:27,780
Yes.

2445
02:33:37,780 --> 02:33:39,780
I'm not a bad cook.

2446
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:41,780
Oh, thank you.

2447
02:33:41,780 --> 02:33:43,780
Yeah, these potatoes are great.

2448
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:45,780
Thanks. Timmy, why don't you try a little

2449
02:33:45,780 --> 02:33:47,780
toast on your jam there, huh?

2450
02:33:49,780 --> 02:33:51,780
Mmm.

2451
02:33:51,780 --> 02:33:55,780
Tim, what's that little white square thing

2452
02:33:55,780 --> 02:33:57,780
right next to your elbow there?

2453
02:33:57,780 --> 02:33:59,780
A napkin.

2454
02:33:59,780 --> 02:34:01,780
Yeah, yeah.

2455
02:34:01,780 --> 02:34:03,780
I don't know.

2456
02:34:03,780 --> 02:34:05,780
I don't know.

2457
02:34:05,780 --> 02:34:07,780
Yeah.

2458
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:11,780
Well, hello there, sleepyhead.

2459
02:34:11,780 --> 02:34:13,780
I thought she was gonna sleep through the morning.

2460
02:34:15,780 --> 02:34:17,780
Is there something wrong, honey?

2461
02:34:19,780 --> 02:34:21,780
Something happened last night.

2462
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:27,780
Timmy, go upstairs, son.

2463
02:34:27,780 --> 02:34:29,780
No.

2464
02:34:29,780 --> 02:34:31,780
I want him to hear this.

2465
02:34:31,780 --> 02:34:33,780
I want all of you to hear this.

2466
02:34:35,780 --> 02:34:37,780
Okay.

2467
02:34:39,780 --> 02:34:41,780
Why do you think you're able to remember this

2468
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:43,780
so clearly without hypnosis?

2469
02:34:45,780 --> 02:34:47,780
Well,

2470
02:34:47,780 --> 02:34:49,780
I think

2471
02:34:49,780 --> 02:34:51,780
because this time they wanted me to remember.

2472
02:34:53,780 --> 02:34:55,780
They wanted me to be able to tell about it.

2473
02:34:57,780 --> 02:34:59,780
You know, I said when

2474
02:34:59,780 --> 02:35:01,780
he held my hands

2475
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:03,780
and he looked at me right before

2476
02:35:03,780 --> 02:35:05,780
he sent me back,

2477
02:35:05,780 --> 02:35:07,780
well, when he did that, I felt this amazing

2478
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:09,780
this burst of emotion.

2479
02:35:11,780 --> 02:35:13,780
It just went right through me

2480
02:35:13,780 --> 02:35:15,780
through my insides.

2481
02:35:17,780 --> 02:35:19,780
Like he, like

2482
02:35:19,780 --> 02:35:21,780
maybe

2483
02:35:21,780 --> 02:35:23,780
he was trying to make me understand

2484
02:35:23,780 --> 02:35:25,780
his feelings.

2485
02:35:27,780 --> 02:35:29,780
And it felt like

2486
02:35:29,780 --> 02:35:31,780
he was

2487
02:35:33,780 --> 02:35:35,780
lots of things sad

2488
02:35:37,780 --> 02:35:39,780
and lonely.

2489
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:45,780
But happy too.

2490
02:35:45,780 --> 02:35:47,780
Happy and satisfied.

2491
02:35:49,780 --> 02:35:51,780
I know he cared about me.

2492
02:35:55,780 --> 02:35:57,780
Like maybe he was gonna miss me as much as I was gonna miss her.

2493
02:35:57,780 --> 02:35:59,780
Whatever it is they're doing,

2494
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:01,780
it's not evil.

2495
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:05,780
I know that.

2496
02:36:07,780 --> 02:36:09,780
I think that's what he was trying to make me understand.

2497
02:36:13,780 --> 02:36:15,780
It's like they're using us

2498
02:36:15,780 --> 02:36:17,780
for some

2499
02:36:17,780 --> 02:36:19,780
important purpose.

2500
02:36:19,780 --> 02:36:21,780
I don't know what it is,

2501
02:36:21,780 --> 02:36:23,780
but I feel that it's important.

2502
02:36:23,780 --> 02:36:25,780
I feel that.

2503
02:36:27,780 --> 02:36:29,780
And I never felt that way before.

2504
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:33,780
Never.

2505
02:36:41,780 --> 02:36:43,780
I know one other thing.

2506
02:36:43,780 --> 02:36:45,780
I don't know what it is,

2507
02:36:45,780 --> 02:36:47,780
but I feel that it's for the good.

2508
02:36:49,780 --> 02:36:51,780
I feel that.

2509
02:36:51,780 --> 02:36:53,780
I know one other thing.

2510
02:36:55,780 --> 02:36:57,780
What's that?

2511
02:36:57,780 --> 02:36:59,780
That it's over.

2512
02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:05,780
At least for now.

2513
02:37:21,780 --> 02:37:23,780
Oh, Neil, take that road over there. I want to show you something.

2514
02:37:23,780 --> 02:37:25,780
What?

2515
02:37:25,780 --> 02:37:27,780
Come on, we've got lots of time. The plane doesn't leave for two hours.

2516
02:37:27,780 --> 02:37:29,780
The plane doesn't leave for two hours.

2517
02:37:49,780 --> 02:37:51,780
What is this place?

2518
02:37:51,780 --> 02:37:53,780
It's where we all used to come to neck.

2519
02:37:53,780 --> 02:37:55,780
Oh, not you.

2520
02:37:57,780 --> 02:37:59,780
Oh.

2521
02:37:59,780 --> 02:38:01,780
What is it?

2522
02:38:01,780 --> 02:38:03,780
What is it?

2523
02:38:27,780 --> 02:38:29,780
What is it?

2524
02:38:29,780 --> 02:38:31,780
She's out there somewhere.

2525
02:38:33,780 --> 02:38:35,780
Mary's child.

2526
02:38:37,780 --> 02:38:39,780
My niece.

2527
02:38:45,780 --> 02:38:47,780
And their other children, too.

2528
02:38:51,780 --> 02:38:53,780
Why do you think they created them?

2529
02:38:55,780 --> 02:38:57,780
To start a new world?

2530
02:38:59,780 --> 02:39:01,780
Maybe.

2531
02:39:03,780 --> 02:39:05,780
Or to save an old one.

2532
02:41:29,780 --> 02:41:31,780
I don't know.
